122468,1,"Recently UBISOFT had to settle a huge class-action suit brought against the company for bundling (the notoriously harmful) StarFORCE DRM with its released games. So what the geniuses at the helm do next? They decide to make the same mistake yet again - by choosing the same DRM scheme that made BIOSHOCK, MASS EFFECT and SPORE infamous: SecuROM 7.xx with LIMITED ACTIVATIONS!

MASS EFFECT can be found in clearance bins only months after its release; SPORE not only undersold miserably but also made history as the boiling point of gamers lashing back, fed up with idiotic DRM schemes. And the clueless MBAs that run an art-form as any other commodity business decided that, ""hey, why not jump into THAT mud-pond ourselves?""

The original FAR CRY was such a GREAT game that any sequel of it would have to fight an uphill battle to begin with (especially without its original developing team). Now imagine shooting this sequel on the foot with a well known, much hated and totally useless DRM scheme that turns it into another Rent-A-Game no one wants. Were I a UBISOFT stock-holder I would be ordering my broker to ""Sell-Sell!-SELL!!"" instead of posting this...

Ever since its 7.xx version, SecuROM has NOTHING to do with ""fighting piracy"". All it does in this direction (blocking certain optical and virtual drives) is a very old, lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smoke-screen. SecuROM is, in fact, an intruding and silent Data-Miner and Root-Hijacker that is delivered by means of popular games.
That is why even the STEAM versions as well as the (free) Demos of such games are infected with it. SecuROM will borrow deep into our PC systems and will refuse to be removed completely even after uninstalling the game it came with. It will retain backdoor access and will keep reporting to its mothership.

Lately, these security concerns have been accentuated as known Trojans seem to be exploiting SecuROM's backdoor access for their own purposes. In effect, installing a SecuROM-infected game in our computer will be placing your hardware and data at risk long after having uninstalled the game.

And the latest vehicle to deliver this hazardous snoopware is FAR CRY 2 - a game crippled by LIMITED INSTALLATIONS! No, thanks. I think I 'll pass this one too.

The only people who do not care about SecuROM are, in fact,...pirates! Because cracking games ""protected"" by this contraption apparently is very easy. Every single game that was supposedly ""protected"" by SecuROM was cracked hours withing its release!
To everyone else though, SecuROM (or StarFORCE or any other hazardous DRM scheme) is a core issue that needs to be resolved before PC gaming can evolve any further. And the best way to resolve such issues is market correction.

That is why it is important for gamers to keep voting with their wallets. And as with any vote, well informed decisions are paramount in making the right choice."

214717,1,"these do not work at all, all i get is static and they came with nothing in the box to give any help."
231734,1,"well let me start by saying that when i first started this game up i was so excited, but when i started playing OMG was i pissed off. The graphics where that of a xbox original, i am not joking they are some of the WORST graphics i have seen in a long time. NOT only are the graphics bad but the game play is not much better. Besides the fact that when you walk you look like you have something rather large in your butt making your player look VERY stiff, and has for the story, WAIT there was a story here??? well if there was anything to do with a story then i must have missed it, the so called story here is not at ALL good in fact it was just pain boring and luckily for me was VERY short beating it in under 2 hours. Ok now on to the level design, well lets just say that it was some of the worst i have seen. It goes like this, run into to dark boring room shoot a few bad guys or zombies then move to the next room that looks almost the same then repeat and do again for the next few hours. Ok so now i will move to the sound of the game, so the zombies when you kill them it sounds OK at best, but as for the sound of the guns WOW OMFG the worst EVER sounds weaker then a nerf guns!!!! the voice overs are very bad as well. Ok now onto the only kind of fun in this game, the only time i had ANY fun on this game was when i played with friends, but even still it was very boring. There is a ranking system that is mediocre at best, the more enemy's you kill the more XP you will get, and when you earn XP you can buy guns that won't really care to use because they all for the most part suck, or you can buy powers for the different players you can choose from. I would also like to add in the fact that when i you enemy it is almost completely random as to when they die, sometimes it will only take a few shoots to kill a simple solder and other time the same kind of enemy will take a clip and a half to kill, as well as that but the hit indication is very OFF. So i will wrap this up by saying this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, rent it first to see for yourself. i hope someone can find fun in this game, but for me i could not find much fun here.

I forgot to add in here that the AI IS THE WORST IN ANY GAME EVER. your team mates make no attempt whatsoever to avoid danger or even bother to shoot at the enemy, your friendly AI will spend the bulk of their time wasting ammo on a wall or ceiling if they are even shooting at ALL, the rest of the time they are just in your way block you in doorways or blocking your shots, never before have i ever seen AI worse than this. As for the enemy AI they are just as bad, half the time the enemy is just standing there as i am shooting them.

SO this game is pretty much a FAIL on every level, its a broken game, But lets hope that resident evil 6 will make up for this REALLY REALLY BAD GAME"
154709,1,"Dont waste your money, you will just end up using the nunchuck, or a classic controler in the end, and more over don't waste your money on the new Mario Cart, just keep, or get one of the older ones, its just recycled maps with new controls that aren't that good anyways."

100980,1,"UPDATE, 2010:  This review is pretty old, and now that we're in 2010 and I'm on even better hardware, I've had a chance to revisit Halo 2.  I still ran into DRM issues with the re-install, and if you already have Games for Windows Live you're going to find installing Halo 2 nearly impossible (I'll post details in the comments)...but if you can get it going in Windows 7, things do get better.  In the past month or so, I only lost my savegames on the Live server twice and have only had it crash itself once.  That said, here is the original review.  I hope it is helpful for you.

I bought Halo 2 for the PC excited about trying it on my brand-new Vista machine.  I have had it for over a year now and have yet to be able to actually play the game all the way through.
I went through the agony of having to create a Live account, and then having the game not ""see"" the account (but not let me log in because I'm ""already logged in"").  I experienced the unfun joys of having Halo 2 randomly tell me my savegame file is corrupted and I have to start again.  I had updates crash the game, my license key invalidate itself, and after unanswered support e-mails, it took me multiple calls and over 3 hours on the phone to get someone to fix the problem.  They had to do this by removing my license key, issuing me a new one, and telling me I'd lose all my ""achievements"" and account info.  That wasn't a great loss, since the program would regularly log me into Live, then say, ""You are not logged into Live.  You will not be able to have any Achievements.  Sorry about that.""  A lot of the messages I get in Halo 2 say, ""Sorry about that.""  Sorry, indeed.

By the time I actually got the game to work (with shuddering framerate and random dropouts in sound), I was just angry.  Angry at all the ""Sorry"" messages, angry at the hassle I have to click through just to load a saved game, and angry at the constant savegame level resets.  I see new Microsoft Games for Windows titles, and I feel I'd be stupid to put risk putting myself through that again."
480887,1,I WISH I COULD GET RID OF IT!!
203224,1,What in the hell is this i can say that some of it looks like part 5 but come on capcom now what happened now the only thing good on here is the demo to revelations and it's 40 dollars in the store now 3D or not the game isn't worth it and the revelations demo is fun but i couldn't beat it and plus if you buy it used you cant delete the last persons information in the game so you have to keep going where they left off
375683,1,"Could be a lot better with different surface material. Just felt weird in my hand with the glossyness to it. If it were all rough and not those ""rubber"" sides it would be OK."
333661,1,"i need to remind myself not to get dlc or season pass anymore, because dlc maps are terrible compare to base game maps

when mw2 stimulus dlc came out, i got that dlc.  dlc maps were uninspiring.  then in mw3, i told myself to give dlc maps one more chance and got dlc1,2,4.  still dlc maps were uninspiring compare to base game maps

now, i was crazy enough to get season pass for ghosts =.="" (facepalm)  what then, dlc 1 maps were not fun at all (compare to base game).  the only thing good was extinction episode 1.

i find myself play more of base game maps than dlc maps.  i probably will not get dlc maps anymore..."
81095,1,"I just bought this game for gamerscore and wow was it a bad game. I can't beleive that anyone would think that this game is fun. The game is very glitchy, unbalanced, and the graphics are terrible. Do not buy this game unless you just want gamerscore from it!"
139259,1,"This game is poorly crafted and I will not be buying anything made by Blizzard for a long time, maybe even never again as they've obviously changed their standards to conform to profit-margin agenda of the corporation that bought them."
81672,1,"Looks cute, quirky and fun.  Shame I won't be buying it until EA wakes up and figures out that punishing paying customers and rewarding piracy isn't really a good business strategy.  DURH!  Doesn't help that they are being very belligerent and arrogant about it, basically telling paying customers ""Tough poopies if you don't like DRM.  What you think doesn't really matter.  Just keep giving us money."""
404437,1,"The Mic stopped working within 20 minutes of use. I am very disappointed with this item. I have used turtle beach in the past, and had nothing but but amazing things to say about them. Looks like it is time to find a new company to support..."
153945,1,"For the better part of an entire year, I was hyped up to this game.  The announcement that there would be no Knockouts was the only thing that soured me a bit.

Then I read a Midway Q&A session on IGN.com regarding the game, and almost every response Midway gave either consisted of ""No, this game will not feature that"" or ""We hope to include that in the next game!""

Missing a lot of things though it may be, Midway showed just how much fail is in this product when they spend an opportunity to hype it up by basically crapping all over it and all but telling us ""don't buy this yet---it's only the beta version of the sequel coming in four or ten years~!""

Then the game itself.  The graphics are good, but what game isn't these days?  You can't give a game a pretty rating just for graphics alone---imagine how Final Fantasy: Spirits Unleashed would have been received if the graphics of the movie were considered a part of how good it was.

Even then, the graphics look nowhere near as good as the now-apparent pre-rendered screenshots plastered across the internet.  I absolutely could not tell that James Storm character was supposed to be James Storm, while for the most part, all the wrestlers look how they're supposed to, but don't break the barrier of shock and awe.  They are more in the league of Smackdown vs Raw 2007 or 2008.

That said, compensation appears to be made for the above-average graphics, by immense cuts in game content.  25 superstars is no real big deal.  When all those superstars have the exact same generic taunts and the same puddle of moves to pick from, THAT is a big deal.  A bad big deal.

The controls are a sloppy and contorted mess.  Arguably this could be from a several year-long accustomment to the controls in WWE games from Day of Reckoning to Smackdown vs Raw 2008, but either way, it's simply not very functional for the R button to be for running, and for the strong-grapple button to be on the opposite side of the controller from the base grapple button itself.

The controls are designed in such a way that it will take a very long time to grow accustomed to them, much less to master them.  Maybe this is due to my clumsiness and retard-fingers, but even I was able to get over the switch of L button for blocking strikes, R button for blocking grapples in SvR07 after a transition from WWE Day of Reckoning 2 (where it was the other way around) within a short while of gameplay.  As such, when you are thrust into the ring early on, your only chance of winning is the basic punch/kick/basic grapple until you can figure out how to do more complex maneuvers without the computer utterly destroying you while you stand around stupidly.

The moves actions in-game are indeed fluid, but only for as long as the opponent is standing.  As soon as they are knocked down and fail to immediately come back up, the fluidity is broken.  As far as I can tell, there is absolutely no way to pick your opponent up when they've fallen---only to stomp or punch them, drop elbows or whatever other thing, or do ground grapples involving the exact same arm locks and such.

The ""fluid"" motions as well must be fluid if you consider just how slowly they come about.  The controls do not react immediately, and once you've set about trying to perform a punch or a grapple, there is no going back.  As such, if you're lightning-fast on your button mashing like I am, you'll be angered to no end by how sloppily your character tries a meek little punch, only for the enemy to back away quickly, then come right back up and hit you while you're still recovering from throwing that first punch.

Midway apparently HAS reason to brag about how ""fluid"" their grapples are as well---there are only about two or three of them the player can perform!  Compared to the dozen or so that can be done in the WWE equivalent, the game pretty much only needs one button and two directions on the analog stick to fluidly perform the exact same suplex or jawbreaker or hurricanrana quickly and efficiently.

Counters are apparently the only area where the uniqueness of TNA's in-ring talent is on display.  Amazingly, the moves are all very ordinary and basic, whereas the counters show off some of the most insane, unique, and innovative maneuvers TNA wrestlers can do.  Counters.

The sound is terrible.  Obviously something like sound isn't really of big importance to a game that does it right, but in this game they've really done something wrong for sound to get mention.  The audience has only three or four noises they make---and they are NOISES, because this crowd never quiets down or gets louder---the generic white noise of screaming, a gasping sound effect used millions of times in various movies and TV shows for the past hundred years, and slightly noisier, but no more louder, cheering.  The punch/kick sounds are comical in nature, sounding like something you'd hear in Street Fighter II or Final Fight for SNES.

I COULD have given the game a two or even three star rating if not for the crux of the massive bag of issues this game is; the fact that the opponent will seemingly always be better than you no matter what, always.

I started the game playing as Chris Sabin vs Shark Boy, and in said match, I was very new and experienced.  I tried a balanced workout of punches and kicks first, followed by experimenting with grapples, and trying to figure out how to do other grapple moves.  Not only did I utterly fail to do anything but snap suplexes, but because I was kicking the crap out of Shark Boy with only the most basic of moves, he easily countered some of them, built up a full iMPACT! bar, and performed his finisher and pinned me for three.

The next match I was AJ Styles vs Rhino.  This bout went even shorter, as despite the fact that we both battled each other equally, my pins barely made two, whereas Rhino's one pin got me at 3 in less than 3 minutes.

Then I go to story mode, where the most damning thing happens:  I spend a good 15 minutes utterly destroying this obese clown named ""Benny"" or some generic name like that, with 80% of all strikes and moves in this match being done by me on him, and I grab him up in my finisher and pin him, and he kicks out.  After a more sustained and concentrated beating, not only does he kick out AGAIN, but he manages to pull off his finisher on ME and PIN ME FOR THREE!  After getting in almost NO offense, he somehow BEATS ME!

This happened THREE TIMES IN A ROW!  After finally beating him somehow, I move on, and THE SAME THING HAPPENS!  I squash my next opponent, and yet they perform enough moves on me (seven moves on me out of 6000 on him is still enough to get you a full iMPACT! bar) to perform his finisher and beat me.

UPDATE: This only seems to get worse as you progress in storyline, as bigger-name stars are even bigger jerkasses to beat, as in one scenario where I LITERALLY squashed James Storm (as in, got over 90% of the matches' offensive moves placed on him), and just because he managed to counter 10% of my moves, HE is able to get a finisher, hit it on me, and pin me for three.  Trying to break out of a pin by wiggling the control stick is such a frantic ordeal, I've cut the skin of my palm just trying to keep an opponent down for a pin by wiggling the control stick.  Or rather, smashing it back and forth wildly.

This is pure BS.  When you're pinned, the game gives you a motion of the analog stick wiggling back and forth in order to break the pin.  The only problem is it doesn't tell you WHICH analog stick this is, and ""wiggling it gently"" is as effective as not wiggling it at all---you have to ram it back and forth as fast as you can.

And so, Midway releases to us a Beta test of a future release.  And it is a great many things; and many of those things are what was once just a verb, but has now become a noun as well: Fail."
223417,1,"DOnt get me wrong , i loved all the CIV games so far .
But this one has nothing new expect the moments and the stacking .

The rest is only for the worse , it keep stuck and hang .
Crash , maps get crazy all of the sudden ...

Not a fun game play , they removed the religion ...

I played it for 3 days and will probably let it gather dust ...

waste of 40$ ..... Could have buy some beer and be more happy that way"
145714,1,it wouldnt play on my older desktop and it won't play on my new laptop so you must have to have a super computer to play the game.

462773,1,"I can't speak for the PlayStation 2 or the XBOX versions of this game, but as for the PC version which I've experienced, there is no reason to buy it whatsoever. The game suffers from one fatal flaw, you cannot adjust the controls for this game. When I plug in my Logitech F310 Gamepad, the controls are preset and cannot be changed. The same problem exists with the Scarface game, on PC you cannot adjust the controls to your preferences after plugging in a Logitech Gamepad. I don't know why. You can adjust the controls for all of the Grand Theft Auto games on the PC. But The Matrix Path of Neo and Scarface, you cannot adjust the controls. I am completely unwilling to sit through more than 2 hours of either of these games if I can't adjust the controls to my preferences. I can't have any fun shooting, running, driving, or performing combo attack moves with the preset controls on either game. The controls are awkward! They don't feel right. After just 2 days of owning it, I donated this game to charity and I've never looked back."
133249,1,"I've played all the other titles of this series, well the ps2/1 versions anyway, and I've enjoyed all those, but this one is hard to enjoy. I don't mind a bit of a challenge, but damn, this is beyond that.
The enemies take many, many hits, you feel as if you're in a boss battle with each one.
The lack of supplies doesn't help much, neither does the wonky combat controls and whatnot.
I've been giving it a chance, but, thinking of trading it in to a place near here."
190569,1,"Coulda-Shoulda been the game of the year for PC instead a huge disappointment from IW.
I've bought and supported Infinity Ward since Call of Duty 1 and can't believe they did this.
Single player was 5 Star but Multiplayer (the reason you buy the game) is a 1 Star- if that.

It's like xbox only worse and the host always has the advantage if you can stand to sit through the matchmaking, host quitting and the rest of the P2P problems.

I can't believe they did this to us.

One word: greed"
26165,1,"THPS2 was fun. The levels made sense, the physics were completely unreal (fun) and the locations had some sort of skatepark or something interesting going on. The locations in THPS3 are lacking. A few are fun, but the majority are chaotic and seem to be designed purely with aggravation in mind. The airport is a great example. The physics have changed for the worse. You feel like your controlling a big sack of lead, and you will fall constantly. The controls are not configurable, and the setup for doing tricks is more a game of hitting things in the correct sequence than any sort of creative use of the terrain. On the technical side, this is one of two PS2 games I've seen crash. Shipping a game that crashes is totally unacceptable, but this level of workmanship seems to be a major theme in THPS3. Overall I'm pretty annoyed with my purchase, and would recommend staying away from this title. Don't even waste your money on a rental. Hopefully some developer as talented as the SSX people will come out with a good skater."
140481,1,"just ""Meh"".  Despite the fact that the cursor flies across the screen at light speed even on it's lowest settings, the game is virtually impossible to play without getting ticked off.  So whatever.  1 star!"
198516,1,"In fact, it is very disappointing to series going down hill. Nothing innovative anymore. I remember original Halo was such a great name, I stay all night finish it. Now it is nothing but garbage. COD MW 1&2 make this gameplay like a childplay. Rent it if you want."
406735,1,"Piece of trash.

Keeps disconnecting my controller.

Bought el-cheapo no-name USB Bluetooth dongle, it works 100% of the time, no disconnections.

93366,1,As you can tell by the last 20 or so posts this seller is selling counterfeit Wii Nunchuks. which are made every more poorly than unapproved 3rd party accessories. besides the retail price on a Nintendo made one is $19.99 so why would you pay more ? go down to your local store and buy a legit one for less....!
89569,1,"Let me start off by saying, I really thought this game had potential but in the end it looks like just another half hearted attempt...

Ok, let us begin with the good. You can play as any character from the series  in any of the games! Good graphics. Create a fighter mode.

The bad- Fighting is absolutely terrible, even worse then the previous games. Now it feels like one of the old Tekken rip offs from the arcades that was only a quarter to play. You can have your weapon out and use it the whole round. You can be knocked into hot lava and killed after 1 hit!

There are no specific fatalities at all, the characters have lost their sense of identity. The value and presence of projectiles is next to nil, Shall I continue?

Overall, this game looks and smells like a weak cash grab from a strugging franchise. You will be happier and still $40 wealthier playing UMK3 from the PS1!@"
409025,1,"I think we have all become so used to wireless controllers, when I saw this on Vine, I almost laughed out loud.  I mean really, a wired controller seems so OLD I thought.  But then I started reading the reviews and thought, ""Hey, I might need to check this out"".

I'm glad I did.

I must say, that the standard Xbox One controllers are very nice.  However, that glowing orb in the middle of the controller has always bothered me when I play in near total darkness.  So I also thought, this controller with lights would be the same way.  Not so.

The fact that you can cycle through colors, schemes and see the innerworkins of the controller make this a great addition to your console, regardless of whether it is wired or not.  It feels steady and well built in your hand and has held up to even the most brutal online matches I've put it through.  While I will say there is no perceptible increase in advantage over wireless, this thing just looks amazing so I will keep using it.

EDIT:  December 12, 2015

Had to reduce it to 1 star.  Controller lasted less than 3 weeks before something has gone awry with the L-Stick making it unusable."

23874,1,Just purchased this thing a few hours ago. I have yet to see it work. It's going back to the store.
375789,1,"Was waiting for this mouse anxiously because my Razer Taipan was spoilt and Razer ask me to pay for shipping back to USA  in order to RMA. (I live on the other side of the world in Singapore) So I plugged in this mouse and the cursor doesn't move at all although the left and right mouse buttons were working fine. Took me 20 minutes of reinstalling synapse 2.0 and 3.0 and uninstall the mouse and repeat everything all over again to realise that the mouse does not work on wooden surfaces.

I would understand if the mouse doesn't work on glass surface but wooden surface?!?! This is really a bummer and I probably have to pay expensive shipping fees to get my refund which is totally not worth it. I have used Razer mouses since 2007 with more than 5 different mouses CopperHead, Diamondback, Lachesis, Taipan, Taipan (again), DeathAdder(this), but this will be my LAST razer mouse for sure. Razer's CEO may be a Singaporean but he disappoints me with such sub-par products and lousy aftersales support. I'm going Logitech or other brands from now on."

305379,1,"If you like hackers and lag, this is a great game. I have owned it for the last 24 hours. I bought it direct from Origin. It took about an hour to download with my 12M connection. About average for modern games. Physics were better and drivability improved over the last ""Most Wanted"" offering. After getting through the tutorial levels I settled in for about 10 hours of non-stop play. Here are my observations. First, you play online exclusively. This is beyond the ""persistent authentication"" of Steam and Origin, you simply must have a good broadband connection with good ping or you won't be able to play. Next, any time another human player enters your bubble of activity, prepare for massive lag with the player warping all around you madly. If you are a cop, forget trying to wreck someone who is never consistently in your game reality. Behind you, beside, in front blinking all around unpredictably. This is absolutely unplayable. The very nastiest part of this game is hackers. Nothing like having a guy warping all around you madly zapping you with pursuit tech over and over. No cool down and no chance to escape while you are killed like a helpless baby. This game is obviously of BETA quality. I wanted it to be great but sadly... it sucks.
 This is very important. EA's Origin Great Game Guarantee? YES. They will refund your money within 24hrs of activation. EA support appears to be much improved over past experiences."
495670,1,"The pedals seem well made, and are wide enough and far enough apart for me. The assembly doesn't slide on a hardwood floor, too.

They are not plug and play. You have to go to the Thrustmaster website and download a driver. The two killer items are: high breakout forces from the detent, and the pedals move the throttle, not the rudder. I'm sure, with a paid version of FSUIPC I could reprogram the functionality, but high detent breakout forces don't make that worthwhile.

I have an ancient set of CH Products rudder pedals. They are ugly, and slip on hardware floors, but the detent breakout force is much less than these pedal's, and more importantly, they move the airplane's rudder.

I'd send them back, but it's way past the end of the return period."
38212,1,"Sorry all but I am about to step on a ton of Nintendo lovers with this brief review about the travesty known as Metroid Prime. If it weren't for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points, I would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a 5 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10 like IGN. Unfortunately, cool graphics, a great map, wonderful environments, super smooth 60FPS and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way through.

Admittedly , this game is from 2002--which would be the infancy of first person shooters on Consoles. This hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the Gamecube controller to make this game livable!! Sure, the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies. The problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemies--like exploding mushrooms, or that rapidly respawning killer grass, or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of. AIming is nearly impossible!! You hold the right trigger and try to move the left stick(the only stick used for control in this game) praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place. YOU see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick!! So you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot at.

All of these things were bearable for the first 5 or 6 hours of the game(I explored every nook and cranny I was loving the game so much) The first few bosses were not too bad and then I got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors. Here is the method. You shoot this boss(for some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss) until he gets kind of winded. You then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirror(Sorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game, you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right?) To destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it. But the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time!! The first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways. Not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time again.

To make matters ever worse, this game uses Save spots. This would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss. NOOOOO. YOu respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a 5 minute platforming section to get back to him. Why do Japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system? Please tell me why??????

Uggh. I think I am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving. So far my experience with the WII has been pretty bad. Should have just stuck with my PS3..."
159416,1,"I was very excited for this game. Unfortunately it is not even close to what I had hoped it to be. I wanted more of Wii Sports. This game isn't even in the same category.

The controls are NOT intuitive. For some of the games the controls don't respond well. In particular the archery game was one where I had to shake the wiimote to get the target to be on (you are not supposed to have to shake it). Soccer was confusing. Skiing was o.k. It was VERY short. Beach Volleyball was so-so. Kart racing (of course) is not Mario Kart.

You cannot play with your Mii (which is REALLY a let down!)

My daughter did play a little when I finished. She remarked that most of the games were very boring. In fact that's a good way to put it. BORING! There is also NO real exercise value to this like you get with Wii Sports--this is one that is absolutely not designed to get you up and moving even a little bit. The only exercise you might get is a little bit of thumb workout. Disappointing.

Hopefully it will have some trade in value since its brand new. Otherwise I'm out $30 (I wrote this review so you won't be too!)"
61703,1,"It was not a good remake and I'd rather play the original then the remake. Overall, I rate this game 1/5."
149558,1,"Seems like this game was deliberately programmed to infuriate me. It's one of those games where you get your butt kicked while you're learning, a sensation I've never treasured. How would you like if I sat you down to a board game you didn't know -- you ask, ""How is it played?"" and I respond, ""Uh, you'll more or less get the idea once I start attacking you!"" That's exactly how this game works. I hate losing while I'm learning.

Anyhow, here's some other things:

1. The way this game was marketed promised a lot of good ol' hack-and-slash action. Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc. Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these! I solve enough g.d. conundrums every day at work: I don't need a video game testing my intelligence. I want to be a guy with huge muscles who runs around slaying monsters with his awesome sword! Is that too much to ask!?

2. The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time. Nearly every encounter is based on the ""cage match"" paradigm: your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue. Yawn.

3. You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type. This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way. This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at. Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements. As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see (e.g., the ledges he's jumping from and to), but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art.

4. The ""easy mode"" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges (i.e, the spike room, flying through the tunnels), they still manage to infuriate everybody.

5. The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game. (I frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done).  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.

6. This game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is (e.g., remember jumping behind Athena's bed?). Most of the time this is because the lighting source (and therefore the shadows) are illogical, so it's difficult to gauge distance and height. Consequently, success in the game's many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill. Also, the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle: sometimes, you can leap vast chasms; other times, you can barely hop over a puddle.

7. I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again. Why doesn't this game let you skip them?

8. The storyline is preposterous. The Olympians are immortal! How can they be killed? And how can you kill people who are already in Hades? And does it make sense that Kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of Olympus when he even can't jump over an effin' puddle!? The gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug!

9. The weapons you get have some grandiose names (e.g., ""Bow of Apollo,"" ""Claws of Hades""), but they're quite ineffectual, even against garden-variety zombies. If you're fighting a run-of-the-mill skeleton and it takes like 50 hits to kill him, it's time for a new weapon. (I love how the much-vaunted ""Bow of Apollo"" has about as much oomph as a spitwad.)

10. Curse you, Yu Suzuki, or whoever invented QTEs (Quick Time Events). I hate them. (These are the times when it's basically a cut scene but you have to press the X button or the O button at the right time.) What is this, the fourth grade? Are we learning to identify shapes this week? Another problem with these is that you can't focus on the cool graphics at all, since you're waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes. QTEs need to be outlawed!

11. This game is far too violent for my taste!  It just got to the point where you didn't want to enter QTEs when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross. If this had been a movie, it probably would have received an X for violence.  I mean, you're graphically pulling folk's heads off and stuff  Couldn't they have at least included a ""BLOOD OFF"" option, like they did in Assassin's Creed II?

12.  Game is not kind to you if you haven't played the first two installments.  You'll be baffled as to what's going on until at least halfway through the game."
233651,1,"The game didn't work on my Wii U, it kept saying an error has occurred, I had to take out the disc and unplug the Wii U and plug it back in, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!"
233515,1,"Harvest Moon: A Tale of Two Towns was my first time playing a Harvest Moon game.  I am a longtime fan of the Animal Crossing series and I always wanted to try out Harvest Moon but never got around to it.  Unfortunately, my first experience with this series was not a pleasant one.  I initially enjoyed starting out in my town of choice (Bluebell), learning to cook, tend to livestock, catch critters, and plant crops. After several in-game days of play I was walking around the mountain and all of a sudden the game shut down for no apparent reason with only a message stating that ""an error occurred."" Since I bought the game used, I tried cleaning it off and starting up again.  It appeared to work for several more in-game days.  After a lot of in-game ""work"" a few hours later, it happened again. I'm walking around the mountain and ""an error occurred.""  Instead of trying to exchange the game right away, I looked online first. To my dismay, it turned out to be a critical design flaw with this game in general and not a problem with my cartridge.  As others have mentioned, you can only save the game by ending your in-game ""day"" and going to bed.  This means you could have just caught a rare critter, sold a lot of items and completed quests and all of a sudden you lose it all at random and go back to your last save.

I have also heard a lot about Natsume deleting customer comments off of their website instead of trying to fix the problem or issue refunds.  I for one am getting sick and tired of the recent industry standards of pumping out every untested piece of junk to meet a deadline rather than worrying about customer service or producing quality software.  This isn't the only game it is happening to - Borderlands 2 has been experiencing major data loss issues for months, and that continues to go unfixed even though they continue to sell new DLC for the game.  There is no excuse for this type of thing and yet it continues to happen.

Natsume has suggested that you try picking up all items before changing screens on the mountain, not playing the livestock petting game more than 5 times per in-game day, and shutting down the game in between every in-game day to reduce incidents of freezing. Ummmmm, NO.  That isn't a fix, that is a royal pain.  I shouldn't have to work around their design flaws.  This game is simply unplayable.

At the end of it all I returned Harvest Moon: A Tale of Two Towns and exchanged it towards Harvest Moon: A New Beginning (the newer one). I still want to give this series a try because I genuinely liked the game other than the freezing thing.  I am not going to review the gameplay of Tale of Two Towns in this review because I see no point in it.  The freezing flaw is unacceptable and it ruins the game for me.  Hopefully A New Beginning also provides a better and more reliable experience."
336620,1,"I really tried to like this game. I thought I would give it a try because it was a the second in the series. Surely if it was popular enough to get a second game to come over to america then there must be something to it that must draw people in, right? Is it the odd concept for a game? Was it the fighting? The dating? I had to know what it was that drew people in, so I went out and bought the limited edition and tried it. After playing for 30 hours I can say that I have no idea. The dungeons are repetitive, the girls are very much the clich female types in a harem games and the main character is very much a Marty Stue. The kids were adorable, but I did not have much attachment to them because the main character cycled through them so fast and they had no characterization/backstory. The battle system was also very repetitive and I had no incentive to go to the next dungeon, I only did because the plot told me to. Grinding was unnecessary because the bosses never gave me much of a challenge, however if you wanted to get in good with the girls I found that it was almost necessary to enter the dungeons more than was needed. Forced grinding made me lose interest to stop playing it early even though I feel like I am near the end.
Dating was so easy; give the girl a gift and answer correctly (though, answering correctly did not matter that much because if you choose the wrong answer you could just come back, give a gift and make it all better) the multiple choice options. Which is typical for a dating-style game, but not entirely inventive and hardly the thing I would imagine to bring players to this game. It was scarily easy to woo even the most stubborn of the girls which made it hard to feel like I accomplished something by the end.
I understand it is an interesting concept, but the battle system, plot and character descriptions could have been written by a 5 year old. I would not have minded the fact that the girls were so fanservice-y if the game itself was even slightly interesting. I find I can't finish this game. After this many hours I feel like the plot should pick up and I should not feel like I am doing the same exact things as I was 20 hours ago. beautiful artwork and cutscenes; very bad game. I would have been okay if this was just a show rather than a game."
194739,1,Awful game...
148643,1,"I bought the Ghostbusters PC version.  Installed successfully and loaded properly.  However, after the initial cinematic scene and intro scene, the game freezes.  The freeze happens before you even get a chance to play.  Also, the game freeze is so bad that you have to reboot your whole computer.  Contacting the company, Atari, does no good; been waiting a week with no response.  Note: The computer that I use exceeds the minimum requirements to play.

The point: The game is probably good, but PC users are out of luck.  If you are using a PC to play games do not buy Ghostbusters."

292180,1,"Overhyped game. Love all Halo and Borderland games so came away disappointed. Should have listened to day 1 reviews from the other major critic review website showing 120 positives but 100 negatives. Bad sign. First I was fooled by the hype of Titanfall, then Diablo III, and now this.

Pros:
- Nice graphics, sound, and gameplay.
- Adventure/light RPG elements.

Cons:
- Just plain not fun and very boring. That goes for the main modes of the campaign which feels like all the missions are just the same.
- Same for vs multiplayer. Not much difference in playing the levels. No variety?... No large 8 vs 8, 12 vs 12, etc. No CTF. No TDM. No invade the base types.
- Lots and lots of rinse and repeat campaign missions or objecives leading to it being repetitive. Too much being the same. Same for multiplayer.
- Playing by yourself is a horrible and extremely boring experience. I played a couple campaign levels with some randoms and it was a little more fun. I play online w/ a dozen close friends and family but NONE of them wanted this game so playing vs multiplayer wasn't fun and was boring. Probably would have had more fun playing campaign w/ close friends and family.
- Nothing special or exciting when doing anything in the game from start to finish. Walking around the planets, talking to people in the city, picking up new equipment, getting new weapons, campaign missions, and vs multiplayer. Found myself going back to my laptop, tablet, phone, or just dozing off/falling asleep on my couch.
- Online only. I have a couple friends that love campaign games but didn't know it can't be played offline. Dumb.
- Kicked you out for being idle. Very annoying you can't pause the game. Sometimes I'm in the middle of a mission but like to do things like start laundry, take a long bathroom break, or fix something to snack on for a few minutes. I come back and I got kicked out to the main menu for being too idle. Dumb. I'm in the middle of mission to get up a few min now I have to start over.
- Peter Dinklage as the main commentator is horrible and sounds very boring. Love him as an actor. Stuck with hearing his non exciting voice in all modes."
278294,1,"Edit: 10/6/2014 - I ended up returning this unit a week after I bought it.  It stopped reading my sega genesis controllers, and I refuse to use the infra-red ones that come packed-in.  I would file this under ""too good to be true."" Some units might work consistently (based on the reviews) but it seems to be VERY 50/50.  As a result, I'm changing my previous rating from 2 stars to 1.  Don't waste your time.

To break it down simply, let's start with pros and cons:
Pros:
1) Composite video output is crisp and clean
2) My Sega Genesis controllers work
3) My Genesis cartridges work
4) Packed-in genesis games play as good as their physical counterparts

Cons:
1) Infrared controllers
2) Sound is poor quality and wrong pitch

The cons greatly outweigh the pros, even though there are more ""pros"" than ""cons.""

The fact that they made these controllers infrared limits their usefulness - or more accurately, renders them useless - because IR requires a clear line of sight and is not exactly known for responsiveness.  IR works great for TV remotes because reflexive and repetitive button pressing is not required for watching TV.  They simply made the controllers IR to cut costs and say they have wireless controllers.  It would have been just as cheap (and more reliable) if they'd packed in wired controllers.  After reading the reviews, I didn't even bother with putting the batteries in...I simply know better.

The sound chip is tuned to the wrong frequency.  For those less technically inclined, it means that everything (music and sound effects) play at a lower pitch than normal, like a cassette walkman when the batteries are low.  It might play at the right tempo, but the pitch is distinctly lower.  For folks that used to own a Genesis, or played the Genesis collections that have come out over the past 10 years, this is very distracting.

That said, I put in my Ghouls & Ghosts cartridge and my Sega Genesis controller, and gave the system a system a legitimate go.  The lower-pitch music made the game more haunting and creepy, but some of the higher-pitched sound effects (or sounds that were SUPPOSED to be higher-pitch) were crackly as the poor sound chip tried to crunch them out.  The buttons were sometimes non-responsive, but that is likely because my controller is from 1990.

After playing a couple stages in Ghouls & Ghosts, I played Sonic & Knuckles on the system itself.  Navigating the menus was simple and straightforward. Each game had a brief description, instructions, and a screen shot of their respective games.  Given the general cheap quality of this system, I feel like some kind of effort did go into making it a reality.

I don't dislike the system, but I can't in good conscience recommend it. Paying $35 for wrong-sounding games, even with the packed-in games as a bonus, just isn't worth it when you can buy Sonic's Ultimate Sega Genesis Collection on PS3/360 for $10 and an old Sega Genesis off of ebay for $10.

This console would be perfect if they had:
A) Done quality testing to recognize the sound chip was wrong
B) Included 2.4 GHz wireless controllers or wired controllers.

I don't dislike it enough to return it, but I will say that the pricepoint doesn't warrant the sacrifices made on the manufacturer's part, and so I have to give this console a 2-star rating for the two ""cons"" of this console, and take a third star off for the cut corners."
246136,1,"Simply put, this isn't Halo. This is Call of Duty using Halo's premise. Strategy is gone, all you do is run around with a DMR and kill people with 3 shots. The graphics looks like the just copy/pasted Bungie's work. Not much was created from scratch here, besides the horrible sound effects. I read through a majority of the reviews and I notice a trend. Pretty much everybody who likes CoD duty gives this game praise. Halo has lost what made it Halo.

Edit: I am getting some heat from fanboys so I'll list a few reasons here why the game sucks:

-killcam is either glitched, or the game's hitbox is completely wrong. The killcam shows your killer shooting at walls and clearly missing you during kills.

-vehicle animations seem unfinished. Watch a Wraith blow up... just wow.

-AI intelligence is at an all time low. Throughout the campaign I had the easist time running down enemies. They don't even move sometimes. The elites will jump into a banshee and then just fly into a wall, stuck there until you kill them. This is pathetic.

-343 messed with the spartan shields. Like I stated above, it only takes 3 hits to die from a DMR. Anybody trying to argue this doesn't know how to count. Aim for the heads, noobs.

-The servers are always screwed up. People's ranks, emblems, colors, and armors keep changing and reverting back to stuff they didn't pick. I don't think I've been in a game yet where a player wasn't saying WTF happened to my spartan.

I could go on and on, but I just don't care enough about this game to keep going. What an embarassing time to be a Halo fan. I can only hope 343 learns from their mistakes and does right with Halo 5. I'll be renting that one, not buying."
316333,1,"I wanted to like this game.  I was into the story they where telling.  I liked the beta they had and the issues did not appear major.  Now i am finally reviewing this and sadly it is a 1 start for me and my oldest son.

The Bad:

The game has issues for us.  He has had enemies go into areas that he cannot get to and still was able to shoot him.  These are failed missions because you cannot take them all out.  I saw this in the beta way back and this was an issue for him only 2 days ago (from this review).

I have had sound issues where everything sounds muffled.  In these instances the frames can drop sometimes.  But the biggest issue is the guns do little to no damage at all.  Case in point:

-Today I was playing a mission.  I had already done a lot of side missions and was way ahead of the level requirement.  I also play on hard and have a fairly easy time with the single player content.  I get to a point where I am defending with a timer.  The sound messes up on the last enemy and no way to damage said enemy.  This leads to spawn after spawn at this point with no damage to enemies.  I finally exit the game and reload.  Starting at the beginning.

-After restarting the mission I am going along and I find that I pass the problem point easily (on hard) and get to the final boss of that mission.  At this point I get the odd sound problem and the guns do no damage.  Long mission and a little disheartening.  I die 4 times.  On the fifth spawn the game puts me on a screen where my character and the games level assets are greyed instead of full color.  My character is walking in place and is aiming to the side but has not weapon in hand.  I am playing single player but the game says ""Waiting for Revive"" on the screen.  No option at all but to exit the game.  I could not fast travel to a safe house.  I could not spawn again.  Nobody could join me to hopefully break me free to finish the mission

The above is just one major issue I have had.  Others:

-Enemies invisible.
-Enemies in walls or other inaccessible places
-Not able to pick up look <--Very bad because I have had drops of much better weapons and cannot pick them up with on 15 of 46 inventory full
-Weapon parts that show on map are not there.  They were there for my son but on my play some are just not showing.  Even though they are on the map
-My son has had connection issues as well with friends who he was playing with.  They just claim the game is slowly breaking completely.  But it is not an issue with out internet and does not effect any other games

In the end I think I am done with Ubisoft games for a while.  I definitely would not recommend this game."
316704,1,"Overpowered mobs, underpowered you - that's this game in its entirety. It was made to be played in groups I guess, but the experience completely aggregates and is overly frustrating."
374500,1,"This game came with Xbone bundle so I had to try it but no..just no.
The campain is predictable and bland, Kevin Spacey pixels are the best part. Your own char looks like retard. Aside from Spacey voice acting atrocious.
The gameplay: it's twitch reflex, AI stupid, you die fast so I put it on recruit after 4 missions to get it done fast.

The multiplayer: I was gobsmacked...I did find a respect for people that do this crap all day but I find no enjoyment in dying instantly. I have no idea how to quickscope or or jump shoot and have no option to learn. My highest score was 8-12 and only when running full speed spraying from hip...you die instantly,so what do class builds mean? I have no idea how this is popular. Presumably you need a 100mb down internet or something to twitch faster (I only have 8mb on classic adsl)

Frustrating game controls

200459,1,"After playing through this game the past week and a half, I have to say I'm highly disappointed. This game is a mess. An absolute piece of garbage. How can a game that had been delayed a half a year turn out to be this unfinished, and why did they push up the release? I have a feeling they just wanted to get this lost cause out the door and recoup as much money as they could. It's obvious they didn't test this game at all outside their own offices.

The game has horrible texture pop in. Sometimes just leaving a room and coming back a second later and it still takes 4 or 5 seconds for the texture to load. The shooting, it just feels off. It's like the gun is unable to aim and hit a running target at all. You can get tko'd in 1 or 2 hits and have to wait to respawn up to 20 seconds. Another problem with this game is the respawns. They give you command posts to capture throughout the game, but yet you can't spawn on them? TSK TSK whoever came up with the bright idea for you to always spawn at the starting point of the level. Not only do you have to wait 20 seconds, but run another minute or so to the objective only to get killed again.

This game is very unbalanced. The attacking team almost has no chance on any objective. I sat back one game as defender online and our team literally mowed down the offensive team for 10 straight minutes. Getting an objective done while in offense online is practically a miracle. Most people don't even adjust their character to meet the class needed to complete the objective, so your mostly going it alone on a team of 7 other people. That's if you get a lag free game...

The lag. It's horrible. No excuse for this kind of lag. I've never experienced this in any game I've played. I'm talking slideshow at some points. It's not just me, but everyone is complaining about the lag. Still, Bethesda/Splash Damage have done nothing to fix it, but add matches with less people. Which means you get to play in games with 2 or 3 people facing off with 2 or 3 people. Real fun! Huge maps with just 2 people per team running around. I wish they would of just canned this game. It's not a game, but an open retail beta copy right now, and Splash Damage has not done one thing to fix it."
106116,1,I gave it one star because I ordered the wrong power supply cord and had to send it back.
318665,1,"I can't recommend this game for console. On PC it is hard to beat in its category (BF1 and Hardline didn't) but on console it has horrible servers, a sparse community, and laughable performance."
191527,1,"First off, I was obsessed with Fallout 1 and 2, and Fallout 3 was just so good that the glitches from the original game just didn't effect me so much.  I was enjoying the original Fallout 3 game too much, but the down loadable contents(DLC) were too glitchy to try again.
Now with a new company making the new installment, I hoped that the quality of the game would be better.  NO IT DIDN'T.  It's basically Fallout 3 with additional glitches that are too much to enjoy.  What is worst is that the glitches are so bad that it CORRUPTS saves.  So forget about continuing your progress, since they won't mean anything.

If you still want to purchase the game, then DON'T PURCHASE THE GAME for this console.  The Xbox 360 has a timed exclusive like Fallout 3.  Also, once the DLCs were available for the PS3 users, the DLCs were filled with glitches that were NEVER PATCHED.

I REALLY HATE THE WAY BETHESDA SOFTWORKS AND their scapegoat, Obsidian Entertainment.  SERIOUSLY, THEY MUST THINK PATCHES ARE A GREAT WAY TO MAKE GAMES.  THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY FINISH THE GAME AND SEE THE QUALITY OF THE GAME IS GOOD ENOUGH TO PASS IT AS A FINISH GAME.

(Review of the game)
It's just one giant DLC.  Almost every part of the game is the same as Fallout 3.  The only differences are just the small details.  New additional weapons, trees, Vegas.  There are some good parts of the game, but there are just too much of the last game in this game that it's really not a new game.

It's much more harder than the last Fallout 3 game.  They went back to the original leveling up sequence from Fallout 1 and 2 where you can only get a perk after leveling up a few times, instead of leveling up every time.  Now you can get two more companions at the same time.  One is a living person and the other is a machine or mechanical one. Also, for Fallout 2 fans, this game does mention the tribal descendant, vault dweller as well as his/her's super mutant companion.  Arefu remind you of anything.

I rented this damn game, and, based on my experience, didn't taking advantage of Black Friday deals where this game was marked down to $34.99.  The game is just so badly made that I didn't want to help top this game as a best-seller.  As a PS3 owner, this time exclusives are worthless.  If you decided to stick it to your PS3 consumers, you can guarantee that some us are more interested in other games than your DLCs when it comes out.

Bethesda Softworks is a bad game company and their treatment towards PS3 consumers are horrible.

When you buy Bethesda Softworks, you're buying an unfinished game period."

138161,1,"This is the worst port I've played in a long time. And I thought Mass Effect was bad. By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.

The controls are lousy. You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail. The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping. Miserable to play throughout.

The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s). I can't get decent frames no matter what. I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics. Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly. Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish. The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.

Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash. It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable. Don't buy under any circumstances."

389112,1,"This is what you get when you allow greed to run unchecked. And 2K GAMES is an insistent and repeat offender of such abhorable tactics.

This is not a game. It is DLC-pushing scheme that will not end before the complete game (which one should expect be getting after sliding over $60!) ends up costing between $350-400. And that too much for any game - let alone a game that brings no innovation in either gameplay or visuals and gets old too soon. Just head over at Metacritic and see for yourself.

Day-one DLCs? Check. (TWELVE of them - totaling $80-extra!)
Endless microtransactions? Check.
Severely limited content? Check.
Single-Player slapped on as an afterthought? Check.
Console-limited graphics? Check.
The ...success of BRINK revisited? You bet!

When someone made the mistake of paying $60 for a shell of a game, been asked to pay $15 for each extra monster and $10 for each extra character is not greed: it is information highway robbery!

A product to ignore. Even when the entire bundle will be available on STEAM Sale for less than $10, it will still be an overpriced boring game.

284298,1,"Read the other reviews about how you have only one chance to make use of slingshot...

My issue is the game crashes / locks up on me all the time since this purchase.

3 times now have lead/forced to a reboot.  What happens is - nothing works in terms of actions.  However, I can move the screen around as normal.  Just can't pick solider or action.
(CTRL ALT DEL - Task Manager - Just pops right back to game. - so you have to select reboot to end the problem)

- One of the original problems I had was the save gave feature - you don't realize you are not saving the game anymore (choosing default save)
and it carries over to this as well.  You have to be really careful to make sure you are saving when you are saving.

- I had accidentally deleted my games when I finished the original - so I have NO idea if you can go into slingshot with a well armed team (as my guys started out from the beginning)

And back to the locking up and crashing.  Just very frustrating to get a mission almost 90% done and have to reboot the PC.

UPDATE about 3 days of playing game:  This time I am taking my time and not researching the PRIORITY items as soon as they show up (I think this acts as a trigger to move to the next level)

So I have been getting everything I can get done before moving on to the priority items.  What I have noticed is I am playing A LOT of the original game.  Very little is different at this point.  I had a couple of slightshot missions early on - like 2 and now 10+ missions have been the regular stuff I already beat.  Perhaps after those key PRIORITY trigger points more will appear and HOPEFULLY the ending is different but for right now, I am just playing the game I bought before - NOT the DLC."
51112,1,"Went and bought this for Xmas. Worked fine, then the next week, ""Disc Read Error""? WTH?!!. Even though I read about this from other owners, I decided to take a chance. Never again. People poke fun at the older sytems, but my Playstation 1 has never, ever failed me, and I almost traded it in for this crap. My other older systems, such as the SNES, Genesis and N64 have performed well without any problems. I took this back and will stick with the ol' skool systems. But then again, I guess I'm not a ""real"" gamer until I own an XBOX or PS2, right? As for the reviewer who told the guy to get a brain because he said playstation 1 was better, why don't YOU get a life. People have their own preferences in what they like."
250955,1,"The case is nice, I feel like my 3DS is protected. However, for some reason I find pushing the L & R buttons more difficult now. The buttons seem somehow out of place. When I try to push the L & R buttons in I am actually pushing a little below them which has caused me to mess up on the game I am playing (my daughter noticed the same problem when she was using my 3DS with the new case).

The hinge on my 3DS has always felt a little loose and I liked the fact that this case helps to support it and it actually makes the hinge feel tighter.

My daughter picked up my 3DS and said ""wow cool case but it sure adds weight to it"". I did notice the weight difference, not major but enough to bother me.

The case is very easy to put on and if you follow directions, fairly easy to take off.  All in all it is really nice looking - goes great with the aqua blue 3DS, seems like it will offer fair protection..... but takes a little getting used to.

update:  While I still like what this case looks like, it does not do anything to protect your 3ds... I knocked my 3ds off my night stand it hit the side of the night stand and fell about 3 feet and hit the floor... and died. It no longer works at all :(  I would think that it could handle a 3 foot fall onto carpeting but it couldn't."

Best Game-  Star Wars Rogue Leader
Best Feature- Game Boy Advance Capibility
Graphics Rating- 4 stars
Xbox:
Best Game- Halo
Best Feature- Dvd Playback
Graphics Rating- 5
I admit that Star Wars Rogue Leader is a very good game but the rest of the games on gamecube you can get on another console or the games stink.
Some people don't have Game Boy Advance (i do) but having a feature that all people cant have is not a very good best feature.
Graphics for the gamecube I think are not that special, the graphics even look somewhat similiar to the first playstation.
Halo is a very good game most people should enjoy it even if they don't like first person shooters.
The best feature for the xbox is dvd Playback some people may not like a video game system having a dvd because they think a video game system should be for video games only, well i still don't understand why that should keep them from buying the xbox if you don't like the fact that dvd Playback is the best feature for xbox than you don't have to use it.
Oddworld Munchs Oddysey is the game that has the worst graphics for xbox  but still the graphics are better than some of the gamecube games.
I hope this review helped you decide between xbox and gamecube."
47512,1,"As a story-teller I was eager to play this game for the wide possinilities of scenarios.  As a game I was very disappointed.  First of all, I wasn't able to move the pointer to select anyoptions.  Only in game play was I able to move my character.  Secondly, instead of just collecting ammo, I was forced to pick up the same weapon multiple times which used up the space of my tool belt.  If one gun ran out of ammo then every gun was out of ammo.  That was just a waste of space.  I also felt limited by the small selection of tools.  Not even the cheat codes would entirely work.  For example, the unlimited ammo only gave me a few extra clips.  The guns themselves were not even very good.  The sniper rifle didn't ""snipe."" The clips were very small in the ammo capacity and the shots were very weak.  I should have bought Halo when I had the chance."

If you're thinking about wasting $65 on this game, do yourself a favor and don't.  Buy it used, if you have to buy it at all, so that EA gets the message that they can't continue to mess with their consumers, year after year after year.

At anypoint, for the 2 yrs that i had it i loved it, but it broke on me earlier this year. YLOD issue.  which is a huge problem from some of the blogs online. i read that quite a few people are having problems with this issue in the older models. what i don't understand is why sony only warranted there product for 1 year. im guesing that they knew there were some flaws in quite a few of them. im very dissapointed with that. Luckily though, i did get an added warranty with my product since it did cost me 500 at the time (bought it from walmart). needless to say, walmart warranty plans suck. i sent it in 3 times because of ylod issue and it came back twice with other problems. still waiting on refund or another ps3.

The end ok each level after cube building you way out of hell at the top is a church and you have to go in the confessional to end the level. The game play is your character playing a boring repetitive cube puzzle game were each level is the same only you have to go faster. And there is no playoff for all the sexual teasing the game try's to pull you in with at the beginning. It a complete fail in every way boring game play.

222243,1,"It is always sad when a great historic game franchise comes to the end of its road. But it is depressingly sad to watch it do so in this condition.

KANE IN DISNEYLAND?
The graphics are laughable. True, EA has been steering the C&C franchise towards the ...cartoon direction ever since the RED ALERT 3 installment. But the RED ALERT series had always been more playful. Even so, what was barely palatable for a RED ALERT game is outright insulting for a TIBERIUM one.
If his tanks could still run-over infantry units, have no doubt, he would hunt down whoever did this to him.
Because, you cannot mock Kane and avoid having your lungs infused with Tiberium fumes!

MORE UNITS? PLEASE WAIT BEHIND THE YELLOW LINE. FOREVER.
One of the most annoying features of the new C&C4 is the units cap. You cannot produce more units above a (very low) number. Upgrading your tech-tree with such a unit cap in place means you have to kill and replace most of your units - and make painful decisions as some units are more equal than others. It feels like having to deal with a (small) Diablo-like inventory: whatever does not fit within the grid must be left behind to rot.
And to add insult to injury, extra units are bestowed with a dropper. A tiny one.
This cap reeks of one thing: an attempt to turn this series into a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (fewer units means less lag). And no one seems to care that this took away one of the most fun tactics in a C&C game: tank rushing.

SORRY, ALL OF OUR TIBERIUM-HARVESTERS HAVE BEEN RECALLED. WOULD YOU CARE FOR A SENSIBLE COMPACT?
A COMMAND & CONQUER game without harvesting? It could be an RTS game of any name (and there have been baseless RTS games before), why did it have to be a C&C game? Because, once again, EA proves to have no respect for this beautiful art-form. If it means exploiting a classic title in its swan song to sell a few more units, so be it.
Moreover, game publishers seem to have an ever declining expectation of their targeted customer IQ. Hence the ever simplified games released. So, yes, this feels like C&C-for-Dummies.

BATTLEFIELD CONTROLS OFFLINE? YOU'RE SCREWED COMMANDER!
Yes, this must be the most inconvenient DRM scheme ever.
If you hate STEAM for requiring endless updates, this is worse.
If you hate games that require online activation because they never actually become yours, yes, this is worse.
And if you hate games that come with Limited Activations and become worthless the moment you pop the box, well yes, this is worse.
This inconceivable scheme demands for the owner of this game to always be online to verify that the copy he payed for is legitimate. That's right, not just activation, ALWAYS ONLINE. Yes, even for a single player game.
Will it deter piracy? No, pirates will be playing the game without all those DRM hassles. Legitimate gamers are left complaining - and, once more, EA will turn a deaf ear.

All in all, C&C4 will not appeal neither to old friends of the series nor younger gamers. And (for as long as it will keep working), it will have you jumping through hoops for the privilege of having ...bought it. And I thought it was the other way around.

This Tiberium field has been depleted long ago.

145641,1,"SecuROM - a sure, instant way of providing death to PC gaming as we know it.  Sure, game companies would like to provide protection against software pirates, but let's make a couple of things clear:

1.  Sorry, Ubi.  If you think that pirates are not going to think their way around this one, think again.
2.  SecuROM interferes with my burner.  I do a LOT of home video creation with Sony Vegas Pro ($500+ software).  Do you think that I'm going to WANT to install a $49 software package that's going to ruin that, not to mention the hell-on-earth experience of REMOVING this piece of junk?  Even if it were in the discount bin at $9.95, I would never even dream of creating an afternoon of fun trying to fix my hardware again.

I am very sad to say that I will not be purchasing Far Cry 2.  I was soooo looking forward to this game, but SecuROM is an instant turn-off.  I don't pirate games, so for some person to wreck my hardware set-up with inept software because they don't trust ME doesn't earn my business.

Mark my words - if the PC gaming industry continues on this path, it will spell a slow but sure death to PC gaming as we know it.  There must be an easier way - and SecuROM isn't it.  Perhaps they should call it SecuROT?

I am going to enjoy my original, legal purchase of Far Cry now."
6739,1,"Please hear me out. Let me try to explain why I gave this system such a low rating.

Had this console not been remembered as being fantastic and interesting, I would be giving it 3 stars. But, unfortunately, there really isn't anything very interesting about this console. The graphics aren't very good compared to the PSX or even some of the better stuff on the Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Virtua Fighter 2, the Shenmue Saturn demo, Sega Rally, and Daytona Championship Circuit Edition, to name a few. Lots of games I've played have very low resolution textures, often sprawled out. The games themselves just aren't very interesting or fun to play, even in multiplayer.

I'm also not a huge fan of the controller. While it has an odd design, it is fairly comfortable, and the joystick is very precise.

Finally, there's the value. The games themselves are not at all worth the high prices they demand. Super Smash Brothers simply isn't as fun as Powerstone or Bushido Blade. Mario Kart 64 isn't as much fan as Ridge Racer Type 4 or Crash Team Racing. Mario Golf is nowhere near as good as Neo Turf Masters. Hell, even Mario isn't as fun as the Crash Bandicoot games. And just about all of the games listed (with the exception of Powerstone 1 or 2) are all marginally cheaper than their N64 competitors.

For the final verdict, this is a system I would recommend avoiding. The prices are far too high for their own good, and the games aren't good enough to justify the prices. If it hadn't been for the huge disappointment all the games I had brought me, this would have a higher rating.

Take off the rose tinted glasses people."

However, my rating is for the ridiculous DOWNLOADING REQUIRED to play the game. Is Blizzard forcing people to DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE game all over again, despite the contents on the disc?! This single 8GB Dual Layer Disc that you get in the box is essentially USELESS.

One would think when you're buying a PHYSICAL DISC, you could start playing the game right away - saving bandwidth/time to install the game; as opposed to buying a DIGITAL CONTENT where you have to download the whole thing.

Blizzard now REQUIRES you to DOWNLOAD an entire whopping 15 GB file to start playing the game.

I played Starcraft 2 when it first came out, but years later today, I decided I wanted to play it again and reinstall the game on a new computer...

I can not believe the installation/update is going to take FOREVER having to download this ridiculous 15 GB file/practically the ENTIRE GAME. What is the point of having the DISC now? It is worthless.

No wonder the game is so cheap now... you are basically buying a CD-KEY and an INSTALLER software without the actual game contents.

Seriously, what is this mess/deal Blizzard is trying to pull? The Update Patch is an enormous 15 GB! (imitates Doc Brown 15 jiggawatts!!!! I mean, 15 gigabytes!!!!!) If I was on 4G network with unlimited bandwidth, I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem, but come on now... Definitely won't be buying any Blizzard games; I don't care if they're selling for a $1.

Having to download DOUBLE the amount of the worthless 8GB Dual Layer Disc, where it's essentially just a download launcher, is absolutely ridiculous bait & switch tactic Blizzard is trying to pull here."

- had to return the first pair after a few months
- had to return the second pair after another few months but decided to go with another brand
- constant screech of a 1991 impact printer outbound to all people on the other end

- no 5.1 surround sound...........total lie
- not digital for PC unless you buy a TOSLINK cable for audio, but then you can't use the microphone, unless you get yet another 3.5mm audio cable to PC, and buy yet ANOTHER male 2.5mm male-to-3.5mm female to connect the headset to the PC, WHICH ISN'T EVEN WIRELESS AT THAT POINT! And even then IT'S NOT 5.1 SURROUND SOUND AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNND THE VoIP QUALITY STILL SCREECHES!

This product was just a total pile of overpriced garbage. After I finally cut my losses with the endless troubleshooting and purchases of extra parts I decided to go with another brand, and researched everything. I found other headsets that were way, way better and of much higher quality but were far less expensive. Do you know why? It's because with this unit YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE WIRELESS CAPABILITY! This unit was easily marked up at least a hundred dollars, simply for the fact that it's wireless. Other than that there is NOTHING good about it. I constantly had problems with it (both of them) and wasted so much money returning the first one and buying extra parts for the second one. Don't buy this. It's absolute crap! I ended up buying a pair of Turtle Beach Ear Force DP11 Dolby Surround Sound Gaming Headset and guess what! It's actually 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound! AND I DON'T NEED TO BUY EXTRA PARTS! The sound is amazing and the microphone isn't super fragile and ready to break internally LIKE BOTH OF THE RAZER HEADSETS I BOUGHT! Oh and I paid $140 less for the Turtle Beach one!

On top of all this - I simply don't want a cloud-only based game. I want my save files and I want my backup of my save files... Had I known what EA did to SimCity, I would not have bought this in the first place.

I was really looking forward to countless hours in this release of SimCity... very sad."
465306,1,"i decided to try this game cause i have not played it in a long time, when playing the game on normal difficulty your timing has to be exact, maybe a little bit early. i cannot make it past the second level without failing on normal difficulty despite how accurate i was. now when you save your game, the menu is sensitive, you need to press the up down left right very quickly or it gets pressed more than once same problem with typing a letter

the game does have an easy mode which does solve the timing issue and make the game a bit more fun, but easy mode only plays the first 3 levels and it does not save, once you beat the 3rd level on easy mode it goes back to the title screen.

also the saved games glitch up, for some reason i cannot access the 2nd level when i got up to it on normal mode."
128009,1,"There is some important storyline you need to see but this game is crap other than that. Imagine kingdom hearts with a different totally random slot battle. That is how stupid this game is. Not the final fantasy that I wanted when i went to play this game. This game sucks and it is the last square game i ever played as a result.

If the creators of these final fantasy games want better sales, make the Final Fantasy VII remake we have wanted for so long. The fans deserve BETTER."

58305,1,your playing a game you think its fun from the case you put it in and everything goes to hell
54229,1,"I try to be very forgiving when I review a game. I know how complicated and stressful the terms are for the designers/programmers.

This game just cannot be excused.

Here are the major problems with this game -

1- The graphics are fair, but chunky, stiff and dated.

2- Gameplay is completely SCRIPTED.

3- Gameplay is clumsy and awkward.

4- Weapons are terribly inaccurate, even from 5 feet away!

5- User Interface is frustrating, switching weapons is too difficult.

6- Story line and voice-acting are pretty lame.

The graphics are not impressive at all, the jungle environment is linited to the paths and directions the designers want you to take...this means you always walk into traps!

You must progress through to your objective, if you don't, the enemies don't stop coming...they are constantly spawned over and over and you'll die! So even though the game teaches you to hide behind cover...you can't because your forced to charge the enemies to make them stop getting spawned...YIKES!

The weapons are terrible. I can stand 5 feet away from an enemy with an M16 or AK-47 and completely miss my target with short bursts to control recoil! Talk about driving you insane!

Then when your in the heat of battle you cannot switch quickly to another wepaon, the guy has to slooooowly holster/shoulder his weapon, then take out the other weapon. By then, your dead!

On top of all of that...you have to play in 3RD person!!!!!!!!!!

About 10 minutes of playing wil have your stomach churning from nauseau and dizziness.

This game could have been lemonade....I guess the development team was too lazy to squeeze so we are left sucking lemons!

SAVE your $$$...buy Call of Duty, Call of Duty:United Offensive...Medal of Honor, Battlefield Vietnam, Star Wars Battlefront....anything is a better choice!

Don't believe me?

Download and try the demo out. Do a Google search for ""ShellShock: Nam '67 reviews"" and see the low scores it gets! Judge for yourself but don't shell out your money right away based on the box cover!"
441203,1,"Black Ops 1 vs Black Ops 2.  First game had great 'feel' to the gameplay.  Black Ops 2 felt like a cheap SEGA arcade port to PC.  That's what Titanfall 2 feels like.  Lot's of bouncing and hopping around.  Titans have lost all of their charm, and feel like cheaper, easier to play versions of their once mighty selves.  Everything just feels weak and shallow in comparison to the first version.  Easier to play for the XBOX crowd, but lame for real fps gamers.  I will give it a go for a few days, but looking like I will spend $60 to switch over to COD...

Revised review.

Single Player: Compelling but seriously short campaign.

Multiplayer:  Aimbot/Wall hacked on the day of release.  Not even worth logging in to the server it is so bad,  Pre-fire is rampant.  I bought two extra copies as gifts for my brothers, and am spending days apologizing for how bad the game play is.  Felt so bad I went out and purchased the new COD in it's place.  Until RESPAWN can get a hold of the hacking problem, I won't buy anther product from them."
241108,1,Lots of problems getting the game to work half way through. Could not finish.
135792,1,I bought this expecting a door for my PSP 3000. It looks like it's the right door but it is not wide enough to fit on the back. Very unhappy.
32881,1,"I bought this used so that I could introduce my son to gaming on the original XBox.. But the controller stopped being recognized by the system shortly after purchase. It worked for about 4 hours before it started intermittently disconnecting and eventually no longer being recognized by the console. The other controller works just fine in all ports, so the system is not the problem. It is unfortunate, but I'll learn from my mistake and buy new next time."
291188,1,"Dont buy this product if you live in central America because there is no way to get playstation plus or redeem codes , you need this to enter online game and functions"
181920,1,"I purchased this game based on the reviews that stated they had no problem running this game without the CD. However, on my Win7 64-bit system, it refuses to play without the CD, instead popping up a SecuROM error message. Nowhere in the product description or on the case itself does it say anything about having SecuROM included, which is deceptive.

I don't know why others have not had an issue, unless the version I received is a different or ""updated"" one where SecuROM has been included. However, I will be returning it as I refuse to own any game that installs SecuROM.

So for those of you who want to avoid this DRM mess and play the game without the CD sitting in the tray, look elsewhere. You also have the option of simply buying this and taking a chance you'll get one like some of the other reviewers, which apparently does not have it installed.

Note: This is a newly purchased computer and Scrabble was the first game installed, so no, it's not another game that installed SecuROM, in case there was any question about that."
201682,1,"Little Big Planet games are not for kids (as well as most adults). My kids (9 and 5) play Mario games without a problem but can only get passed the first dozen levels in this game. The difficulty gets ridiculous after the first few levels. As a big gamer myself, I find most levels to be TOO challenging. I think the main issue though is the ""controls"". This is not a Mario game...the character movements and controls are terrible so imagine what can happen during a difficult parts of a level. After you lose all of your lives (which are very few), you have to retry all the way from the beginning. UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great graphics and a lot of potential wasted with difficult levels and clunky controls....almost the worst controls in gaming history, in my opinion!"
174183,1,"I have the steam version of this game, is a pain try to play it.
When I select keyboard to remap the keys, the game crash.
The key I for inventory doesn't work.
Also the game crash after some minutes of start playing it.
Developers should test more their products before make the releases.
A complete waste of money."

THE ONLINE YOU ARE PLAYING AND YOU ARE DOING GREAT AND THEN PUFF DISCONECTED AND I HAVE 1.5 CABLE CONECTION. IF YOU PLAY THE GAME NORMALY SOLO WITHOUT ONLINE IS KIND OF GOOD GAME BUT TOO EASY. NEXT TIME I HOPE THEY MAKE BETTER GRAPHICS SOULCALIBUR 4 HAVE BETTER GRAPHICS SO COMMON CAPCOM.
161312,1,"I bought two of these a few months ago, both have stopped working.  Poorly made, lousy response, just a really bad game controller.  Stay away from this junk.  There is a reason it's so cheaply priced."
245128,1,"After Bioware's showings on Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age 2, it was quite clear that the EA board room was going to have more control over their games than their development team. Thus you end up with a rushed product. I'm sure the Mass Effect team did their best to reconcile what they felt needed to be done with the demands set upon them. It is not their efforts I critique, but their inability to fight for their own work. You can have a worthy conclusion to the saga or a two year development period, not both. So they saved some money on a short development and they loose a third of their fan base. I urge everyone not to buy this or at the very least wait until it's a value title. I will be selling my copy in order to take another $60 from Bioware/EA. I will not buy any DLC from them ever again and I will never purchase another game from them. What they don't understand is how quickly fans can walk away from them. I urge to do just that. I hope releasing another half baked game was worth it."
408395,1,"This is one of the most frustrating games my family has encountered in a long time. When you can actually get on a server and play, it's loads of fun BUT you must spend literally hours sometimes getting times out waiting for a match or getting kicked from the server almost immediately. Seriously - hours. Even worse, when you finally are able to enter a match, often you make it almost all the way to the end and get kicked just before. This is unbelievably frustrating as you cannot level up without completing matches. The older teen boys in my house just gave up after a couple of hours. I tried longer, as did an adult son but we all come to the same consensus - this game is not ready for release.

It's too bad because the game looks so promising. The intro cut scene is just gorgeous and while the story line isn't especially strong or fresh, the multiplayer modes are great - when you can actually play. This is a hand to hand combat game and the character customization options are extensive after playing for a while.

Because I got this through the Amazon Vine program, I will keep trying weekly and will update if the server issues are remedied. Until then, I can't recommend anyone buying it."
376179,1,"Bought 2 months ago, and mouse wheel already breaks. Great quality mouse. Would purchase again. 10/10."
221045,1,"I won't bother to review this controller based on its features or capabilities, that's already been done.

Fundamentally, this controller doesn't work. The left analog stick will randomly ""stick"" or fail while playing games. The physical stick works great, but the game will react as if you are holding the stick in one direction when you have actually released it, or moved it in a different direction.
It does this intermittently and at random, and when it goes cock-eyed it may last for seconds or minutes. This made playing some games like Bioshock Infinite a bit of a challenge but not undoable. However a dual-stick shooter is impossible to play, unless your idea of playing a game is to play it like a retarded 4 year old.

I've updated the drivers (which are 3 years old), replaced batteries and re-calibrated it. Logitech support is, as usual, useless. You can search and find thousands of people reporting this problem and others.

This is a highly rated controller on Amazon for two reasons:
1) Cheap people who are more excited about the money they saved
2) Shills for Logitech"
172264,1,My husband I started playing the game on launch day it was fun at first but slowly lost its appeal. Sadly to say we ended going back to WOW for some reason I have had more fun with that than I did with SWTOR. There has been a lot of hype for the game and sad to say bioware/EA has ruined this game. And they will continue to do so from what I have read. Many issues not fixed during beta and I have to say the game should still be in beta. It will be ten dollars at some point or go f2p in a about year or 2 from now. To me there isn't enough to do in the game. Battle grounds suck its the same rinse and repeat. Not enough characters or classes as well. So I have to agree with many on here the game is awful. And a waste of sixty bucks I will play WOW and wait for GW2 I don't think I will go back to SWTOR after my account closes might not even check it out if it goes to f2p not impressed at all and in fact kind of mad at myself for letting my husband buy the games in the first place I guess you have to live and learn so in a nutshell I don't recomend the game to anyone. Unless you are a starwars fan and this is your thing great if not don't bother play something else the game is not worth it
407204,1,"I found this game to be very boring and extremely one sided in so far as you had virtually no way to defend yourself.  The fighting mechanics were awful, just awful.  I play games to have fun, not torture myself with uninspiring characters and clunky controls.  I wanted to like this game, but after 7 chapters I had enough."
305656,1,"Ripped off. Shame on Amazon. I thought I was buying a new Game. When I tried to activate it the code came up as ""already used"" .. so I got nothing for my purchase. Checked around and it seems to be a common problem for this game bought on amazon"

74673,1,"The first fishy thing I had with this product is that it came within a ziploc bag, not the usual hard plastic the Microsoft Batteries come in.  I even thought that it was a battery ripoff, but it actually had the MS hologram, so could well be an already used battery.  No problem so far as long as it worked, which did well for two months, and yesterday it just stopped charging.  They may be a used lot, refurbished, or plain and simple and old and dry useless lot.  I've read many complaints about them, but thought that it could be some that come bad, but it results that most, if not all, are bad.  I really do no recommend buying this."
220929,1,"God i hate it when companies take things like controlpads and try to make them look aesthetically pleasing to home-decor over gameplay.

it must have been a woman that designed this pad.

i can't play without colored buttons. it makes it take far too long for me to figure out what to push.  color & shapes makes our brains grasp layouts quickly when it counts in a game.
i also hate the lack of different colors of the Wii controller.  controllers need to be all as colorful as the Gamecube pad.

i can't review it based on anything else becuase after i saw this i threw it back to the fishes."
288864,1,I bought this a week ago and was happily playing until a steam update crashed it.  Now it doesn't work at all.  The problem is not with the game itself but with the evil steam wrapper.  Steam's support is entirely email based and they apparently can't be bothered to help.  They also don't allow refunds so they have very effectively stolen my money without providing a useable product.

192874,1,This game is pretty difficult in terms of fighting but that wasn't that big of an issue. There aren't any save points. That is why I'm getting rid of it. I don't spend hours playing a game to just get killed and start all over from the start and lose everything that you have accomplished. Guess what? When you have to fight these guys all over again you don't get anything after defeating them so your health supply is constantly dwindling down.  People are saying that it can be frustrating at first but you will get used to it. Not a chance. I don't have the patience to repeat things over and over. Into the archive of bad games it goes!
182454,1,Piece of crap!!  Didn't work right out of the package!!
362065,1,"Might be the worst game I've played in the past 2-3 years, which is maddening considering how many aspects they get right.

1. Visually it's a fantastic game.  The rubble that is Manhattan is well done with a solid feeling of grit and mud.  Playing at 4K/Ultra on a gtx 1070 is quite nice.  The day/night cycles are well timed.  Madison Square Garden is fantastic.
2.  The whole idea of the ""dark zone"" where human-on-human killing is allowed, but results in a bounty on your head...that's a very clever way of merging single player and multiplayer together.  The first few times I strayed into the dark zone, I was nervous as hell and moved slow and cautiously to avoid detection from the AI or any possible human players.
3.  The inventory system is well done with lots of various clothing, tools, accessories, and of course, weapons.

The part that just royally screws everything up is the gameplay mechanics.  There's a ""cover"" system where you press space bar to grab cover behind a wall or desk or whatever.  Where you'll want to throw this game out the window is when your cover no longer serves it's purpose and you try desperately to 'detach' from cover and cannot do so.  I've died about 500 times too many because I couldn't separate from a wall when an enemy flanked me.  It's not the worst idea, it's just botched like nobody has ever botched anything before.

I should have known that a game that's less than 50% of it's MSRP only a few months after launch will certainly have serious problems.  It's just unplayable.  All that glorious goodness that they got right...it's all wasted because I just can't move around the world and engage in combat in an effective manner.  I am constantly fighting the interface.  No thanks. Uninstalled after a week."
368780,1,Got for free and I feel like that was a rip of. If you are paying for it I would pass.
380506,1,"Originally gave this a 4/5, bumping that down to 2/5. After barely a year of actual use(when I got this there was a 6 month period of very casual to 0 use before it could actually be used for gaming) the left mouse button has snapped off. I'm not rough on my electronics by any means, so to have a mouse snap after only a year of real use is incredibly frustrating, especially for something I spent $60. I will not be purchasing a Razer product again."
250469,1,"I brought this game for my wife. She is not a big gamer but she plays a lot of sims on the computer, she played this game for a few hours and never played it again her words was ""this game sucks""."
288245,1,"First of all, i have gotten all achievements except for the 100% complete.  There is a review out there that explains the frustration with the flying controls and sometimes the camera (the view displayed to the gamer while playing) is just awful.  I love most if not all of the Lego series.  The glitches in this game are almost unbearable.

1. Characters sometimes get stuck in places that require a restart of the level.
 - This is highly frustrating and can really take the wind out of the players sails.
2. Game freezes and locks up at what seems like regular intervals.
 - In this day and age of games designed specifically for a console, glitches and bugs of this nature are completely inexcusable.  This just should not happen.  As of this posting, there have been no patches or discussion of patches.  This was a game that i looked forward to since the summer.  Traverler's Tales punched us in the gut with this one.
3. Some puzzles are just way to frustrating.
- There are a few instances where you might just choose to ignore a few side missions.  Poor design and ""wash, rinse, and repeat"" missions eventually feel like a punch in the gut.

Younger kids will like this game, but parents beware, it's always tough to explain to a young one why their game just froze up.  Although, these days, kids probably already know why.

Liked it, but the shortcomings are too great for anything greater than a one.  If TT can patch the game, this would be a 4.  (not sure you can patch the very bad flying mechanics, and flying is a bigger part of the game than you realize.)"

However on this PSP the game is a complete letdown. I don't know if it's just me but during points this game will flicker a bit. Also the players look completly fake. The players play styles doesn't match. I wish this scale had 0 stars because this game is a complete waste of resources. I watch tennis and know the players styles so I know what I'm talking about. If your going to buy this game please don't. If you really want a good tennis game for the PSP get ""Smash Court Tennis 3"" as it puts this Virtua Tennis to shame. I also should mention that the game is a dark.. I just don't like this game at all."

236752,1,"I run a new high-performance PC and it is painfully obvious that Need for Speed: Most Wanted was not made for this type of computer (3.3 GHz quad core 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 650 TI, Windows 7 64-bit). They may have spent thousands of hours developing the game BUT they didn't spend 3 hours configuring it for PC. It's simply not consistent. Everything is by luck of the draw; you may be able to configure your controller on one start up and be able to configure a few of the controller functions but then you can't do other controller functions. There is no rhyme or reason. It posts notice or warning messages on top of one another so you can't see the one below the one on top. It tells you to pushbuttons that don't exist on your keyboard or controller. Sometimes, there will be a picture of the enter button on the keyboard and other times that picture isn't there. This is important because sometimes you're supposed to push the (6) button but since it's not showing any buttons it's just blank so you have absolutely no idea what button to push. I am an experienced PC user and have verified the operation of my controller. I have Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010 and after several hours was able to get it to operate correctly but it too was very ""glitchy"" when it came to the initial set up. This is just a very poor piece of work for use on a PC. EA and Criterion should go to the shopping mall and learn the same lesson that Microsoft is learning; Apple is doing a land office business because their stuff actually works!"
176193,1,"I purchased these from Newegg rather than Amazon. I was not impressed with the sound quality at all. The audio seemed to have a slight muffled quality and low volume. I cranked the inline volume control all the way up just to get it to be at a normal audio level. The mic was so barely audible that it was useless. I tried setting the recording volume to the max in my sound settings on my PC and it didn't fix it. In order to get it to pick up anything at all I'd have to shout into the mic. Tried both the jacks on the front panel of my PC and on the back directly into my motherboard with no luck. There is also too much bass. You lose the clarity of the sound effects because of the bass reverb causing everything to blend into a rumble which I didn't like at all and there's no way to adjust bass levels. They also fit really tight and pinch your ears. I tried adjusting the headband but all that did was make it looser on the top of my head while the earphones still squeezed tight. I was disappointed all around by this headset and RMA'd it for a refund pretty much right away. They are cheap, but not worth it. I'd rather just use my earbuds I have laying around than this headset. Next headset I buy is going to be another USB headset like my old one that died and not analog like this one. I really don't get how this headset is getting overall positive reviews."

This mode is built broken, in order to get people to purchase Madden coins online.

63530,1,"Awful!! Those people that gave this game good reviews are making money in some way from the sale of this game. I heard it was similar to the X-Men Legends game (which was great) so I didn't think twice about picking it up. I could not have been more disappointed. Graphics stink, gameplay is awful...I can't think of anything nice to say about it.

I should have seen it coming...the commercials for the game have no actual footage or screenshots from the game. The animation on the commercial looks nothing like the game. Multi player mode is even worse than single which stinks.

If you just feel the need to get rid of 50 bucks....flush it down the toilet and cut your losses. You'll feel better about yourself than if you actually spend money on this crap and then feel obligated to play it."
345878,1,"Ok so this is a complete failure in trying to get a transformers game out on the new consoles. If they would've just done a fall of cybertron remastered edition with a few more levels in campaign I would've been much happier.

Fall of cybertron was the best transformers game I had ever played and multiplayer wise it was the best experience I had with conquest, escalation, capture the flag, and my favorite of course the deathmatch. True player on player competition.

Hopefully they could redeem themselves by creating a patch and adding these modes.

They also removed the customization of your own unique bots.

Edge of reality basically hurt the high moon series badly.

That being said there are a few additions that are welcome but lack of new weapons, killing the multiplayer, and not a big jump in graphics it falls short dramatically. If I was an executive for activision I would be pushing the development team to build a patch to release to make up for this failure of a rushed product. Games can still be fixed, updated, and made better after the launch with PSN. If a patch comes out addressing these issues it could be a great game until then it's the only transformers game available on PS4.

If you loved the multiplayer of fall of cybertron you will be disappointed. If you haven't played any of the foc series and are a newbee that doesn't care about online gaming you might like this game a lot. If you are a kid under 13 you probably won't care and enjoy it as a transformers game.

I hope this puts it into perspective for you. Please leave some feedback or comments."

1)graphics are awful, more then a snes game, this looks as a nes game.
2)easy version for the us audience, is too damn easy
3)no dush button, the game is terrible slow
4)very bad and censored script

My gripes for this game itself
1) music is annoying, 20 seconds MIDI endlessly repeated
2)short game, less then 20 hours
3)The plot has absolutely zero depth or detail
4)primitive gameplay, no job system, no esper system, no materia system, nothing of nothing
5)don' t even choose party members, the story choose your party ( most strategic game ever eh?)
6)the game world is too generic, no information at all. The game has 8 countries, but, you do not know anything about them.
7) no description of items
8) in the equipment shops, you don't see the changes of statistics
9)too large party so little time, characters don't receive a true development besides kain or cecil
10)Rosa is the worst feminine character ever, zero depht, zero background, I don't know any information about her, besides she's the white mage of the castle and love Cecil
11)Cecil start evil? Don't make me laugh!!!! In the very first scene it's already a good guy!
12)dungeons are boring! Cave, cave, cave, cave, mountain , cave, cave, cave....

Whit this UNBIASED review of ff2(4)I'm trying to help the new rpg gamers often deceived from nostalgic o fanboy reviewers.
My advertise? If you want so badly play final fantasy 4 try the psp version( the best version) is 100% improvement over this, or try the ds version if you like cartonish and blocking graphics.
 Stay away from the terrible gba version, loaded with bugs, bad control, bad sound and low difficult.
 Psx version is basically uncensored japanese hard-type snes version with a couple of fmv and the dash button, decent version but really no any real improvement."

457396,1,"This game is terrible!!!  The game doesn't give you any idea of where the ball is going which results in:

Having no idea where serves are going to go.

Never knowing whether or not the ball will be out.

Having no idea where to go when the player lobs it.

This was the most frustrating, un-fun videogame I have ever played in my life.  STAY AWAY FROM IT COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!"
89656,1,"We were more than patient with you with BF 1942 because it was revolutionary and eventually the patches caught up and there was expansion goodness for everyone.

We were forgiving with BF Vietnam for the balancing, bugginess, lack of standard features, and maps just so we could have all the helicopter goodness.

We were excited and then quickly disappointed by BF 2 with all the same problems showing up yet a third time along and a lacking of features promised in the last two versions along with a crop of other things such as rampant cheating and patch updates that were almost non-existant.

I'll admit we're a bit slow, but if you think we're going to throw money yet a fourth time your way, for what amounts to a mod, a buggy mod at that, with the great new feature being adware, wow you're dumber than we are.

I for one am going to pass.  I'll check back in six months, if it lasts that long.  Hopefully by then all the patches and balancing will be done.  If that is the case, then I'll think about picking it up.

JUST TO BE FAIR

Just be fair I went back and gave it another try. Here is how it went.

Another 22 hour download. Nice
Reintstalled Dx9
Reinstalled game
Game crashed first attempt, but came up second time no problems.
I see that the jump to center, bug/characteristic is still in the control menu, annoying, but tollerable. It's been there since the 1942 version.
Getting the control menu to keep my settings took a few attempts. For some reason it was dead set on keeping W set to nothing. I don't use WASD I use ESDF, more keys to the left to use. Similar problems setting up the joystick and mouse, but nothing serious, just had to play a game solo and jump into the menu 10-15 times to keep changing things back, again another characteristic that has been with us since 1942.
Video is similar to BF2, as long as I don't max them out it is very smooth.

No widescreen support, big thumbs down. Closest thing to 1900x1200 is 1600x1200. Some warping, but playable. Sorry kiddies who think wide screen is cheating, I like my 24"" monitor and like having a wider view.

The optimizing shaders annoyance is back from BF2. If you change video setting expect a 5 minute or more wait till it optimizes something. Don't know why this couldn't be done before you try to enter a map in the background, so you are going to be late to the fight the first time after a change.

Game play that I tried was Titan. Interesting concept, though nothing original it's been around since the days of UT and RtCW. Moving around and launching aircraft onboard the Titan is buggy quite a bit of the time. The ship moves around subtly causing things to get hung up.
Weapons seem to be more accurate, but classes feel kind of generalized due to the reduction in total numbers.
Sound quality is still pretty muted and generic, all the weapons sound alike, but at least they've finally figured out what 3d sound is. You know which way it's coming from now.

The powered lift craft, they're not helicopters, they're not airplanes. It feels like they're found the perfect dumbed down sensitivity. BFV they were crazy sensitive, BF2 they felt like you were flying with your hands numb. I personally like things light and sensitive, it took a lot of skill to fly them, but this should help get people up to speed faster and make people less afraid of jumping in with random pilots.

Looks like the helicopter instant roll over and play dead bug is still in the game.

The ground vehicles are so so. The weapons have some interesting characteristics, like the curve ball grenades on the walker. Other than that nothing really new.

Lot's of gun stabilization on vehicle guns finally make accurate passenger support fire possible while on the move.

There is no cover or vegetation which to speak of, but then none of the BF games ever have had much. I like the fatigue bar, but it's a LONG run between things to hide behind, so anyone on foot is still going to be constantly caught out in the open.

The indestructable chain link fences make a return to the game ready to stop your 80 ton tank dead in it's tracks.

Light vehicles aren't all that fast and explode almost instantly upon contact with water. Seems even in the future that is still a problem. The walker can wade accross no problems.

I saw one of the infamous billboards. It was green and simple said ""The Enemy is out there"" So right they are, but I didn't notice any more than that. No adds. I'd rather if they were going to stuff adds in the game to have them in the menu while you are looking for a server to join rather than in the game. The classic ""Brought to you by Brand X"" type placements there would be less strange.

This game feels very much like a mod, it still needs some tweeking to get some things right. The Menu system is still quirky, but seems to be actually stable, which is an absolute first for any BF game. Simple things like not telling you how to set up a joystick are still absent. It's not hard, but it's not obvious either.

There is nothing that interesting to a long time BF vet to make me want to pay money for it. I find the whole thing kind of boring. There are better games out there that suck you into the action better. It seems that DICE didn't bother lifting any ideas from the many games that have come out since they have come onto the scene.

I downgrade my opinion from flame to yawn.

Wars are dirty, loud, confusing, overwhelming, and dented. This game delivers none of that. Even BF2 for all it's warts still seems to be the much better game."
431536,1,Waste of money. Nothing new.
307417,1,"8 reasons Thief is the worst game I've played so far of this new generation:

1 - VISIBILITY
the game is so dark i can barely see anything half the time. there is no in-game brightness slider - the game tells you to use YOUR OWN display to adjust brightness. what? just for this one stupid game? then adjust it back for everything else I use it for? and back-n-forth and back-n-forth constantly over-and-over again? that's incredibly inconvenient and flat out stupid. it didn't matter, the game was impossible for me to get through so I had to do it just to be able to see where I was. after adjusting the brightness and contrast, I still struggle to see anything properly and whatever beauty I'm supposed to be witnessing is now completely washed out. this game may end up being the one that has actually physically harmed me (my eyes) the most...Note: I use a projector but there is NO issue with my display as ALL other games function as they should (BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM!) We joked as I went through, ""wow, progressive values have really taken hold. I never thought I'd be able to play a game developed BY BLIND PEOPLE!!!!"" Others in the room joked, ""they should have called THIS game 'The Darkness'""

2 - CINEMATICS
at the end of the first level the game completely froze during what was obviously (based on the latter dialog of other characters) a VERY IMPORTANT cut scene. i completely missed what happened in the story as a result. Something happened to the main female character. alive? dead? missing? were there bad guys there? did they kill, abduct her? me? something happened to me...I have no idea what the hell happened - that scene is gone...stupid. at the end of the game, you beat a boss (the battle itself is a bit stupid). You go from beating the boss in the middle of a ship, to a confounding cinematic in which the boss is somehow dramatically hanging on a ledge of the ship (like at the end of Die Hard) nowhere near where they once were (did they teleport?)...as the 7-year-old in the room remarked ""why does that even matter, there's water below""). The boss acted as if they would fall to their death. Why? The fall looked like 20 feet at the most and into gentle water. Can they not swim?

3 - TONE
the main character seems to have 2 tones, sarcastic and sarcastic a-hole. actually that describes everyone's character. what motivation is supposed to propel the gamer through toward the end? why steal everything? for what? to live in the worst, most miserable city ever? It's like a medieval Detroit. The Theives Guild series of quests in Skyrim, which were somewhat generic, at least made some kind of sense...you'll stole a bunch of stuff to restore the guild to it's former glory and rose in it's ranks...but why are we here in Thief? we appear to be stealing everything not nailed down, even from poor harmless victims...for what? so now the city will even be worse? not much back story to explain the main character's motivations. I liked or sympathized with 0 characters in this game. if you nuked it from orbit, I wouldn't care, nor would you...probably nor would they....

4 - NAVIGATION
the map is utterly useless, even counter-intuitive. if you can't remember how to get back to such-n-such place (which will happen regularly as quests are assigned) and consult the map, the map may lead you into a solid wall, a complete closed off area, etc... you also continuously LOSE the smaller corner map every time you save, transition, etc. Annoying. Also annoying are the multiple button presses that it takes to get to the big map. as the map isn't very pretty or inspiring, at least they should have made it useful. the map coupled with struggling to be able to see things properly made getting from point A-to-B maddening. Navigation and mobility, which you'd think you'd want to be functioning well as you're a thief, are the biggest (unintentional) challenges in the game.

5 - DIALOG
dialog is idiotic and repetitive. all the characters bitch that they wish they had some coffee. is this world barren of coffee? robotic character animations are repetitive. if you have subtitles turned on, you'll see inaudible dialog repeated over and over and over. i turned it off. the audio is weird in many places. you'll overhear characters that are supposed to be inside (giving you clues as to where treasures are), as clear as day...

6 - RESPAWN
enemies annoyingly constantly re-spawn (similar to Farcry2). no way to get rid of them permanently. once you feel like you've stealthfully gotten past them once or twice in the proper ghostly way, you'll get bored of that...I ended up just running past most of them for the rest of the game...combat isn't particularly interesting. you can fire an arrow or 2 or hit someone with a sap. and that's it.

7 - STEALING
the game's called Thief, so hows the stealing part? pretty mundane. it's not particularly broken. but it isn't unique or interesting relative to other games. sneak past dude. crawl. sneak past some other dude. steal thing. unlock thing. steal other thing...sneak and escape. unlocking stuff is a simple affair. rotate thumb stick...based on some of the other fundamental things being completely broken (being able to see, navigation), I'm actually glad they didn't decide to do some extravagant unique auteur idea here...it probably would have completely misfired...

8 - COMPETITION
the game's natural competitors are Assassin's Creed, Dishonored, Hitman, and other similar stealth-based titles like the original Splinter Cell...Thief has NOTHING over any of these games. Not even 1 unique bullet point or thing-that-works-better or aesthetic or anything at all...Go play those games instead. I can't compare it to other games in the Thief franchise. I haven't played them. This entry does not make me want to...

COMPLETE UTTER FAILURE"
190503,1,"I bought this game a couple months back during a sale. If you  want to play the single player alone and don't care about multiplayer I would suggest picking up this game for around 5-10 dollars.

If you are looking for multiplayer I would look elsewhere. When playing multiplayer on steam it is bugged and will always return 0/0 players in any game mode, you basically have to leave it on the most popular type TDM and pray you hit a match.

When in these games the connections have significantly deteriorated the life of the product. Before I used to get almost full ping each match and now one bar is the norm.

IW and steam seem to have zero interest in fixing any of the issues or the hacked lobbies. They did take the time to shut down alterIW net which offered a bett multiplayer experience.

I would look elsewhere for a good FPS, and I wouldn't start with MW3 either."
99522,1,"Dont get me wrong, killing Nazis is fun and all, but you need the game to be more then just that. And after all the hype, all the delays, they fail. The graphics are poor. The first window i shot cracked in the most unbelievable way. The enemy AI became very predictable in there standard duck and cover movements. The overly long cut scenes were irreverent and the fact i couldn't skip them just added to the flavor or S@#! that was already in my mouth from the start of the game. It made my want to go get Call of Duty 3 again.

Dont buy, either wait for COD:WAT or just go get COD 4 and play that.

1/5

PS, i got it for free and it still sucked."
210808,1,"Here we go again, Capcom. They pulled the same crap with Street Fighter 4. Capcom releases an ""ok"" game with a better version already in the works. I should have known better than to buy this. From now on if a Capcom games looks good, I will wait 2 years and buy it dirt cheap.
This game is fun. If you liked MvC2, you will definitely like MvC3. The graphics are pretty sweet. Nice comic book feel. Now the background is kind of ""busy"". Some people can't get used to all the comotion and moving in the background. I got used to it and don't even pay attention to it anymore.
Like I said, this game is fun. It is a good fighter. ***BUT DO NOT BUY IT*** Capcom is, again, screwing it's fans by releasing a better version soon."
59976,1,"Bought two at wal-mart to use with the Wii. They do work with it, but very soon after I bought them the analog sticks began to stick in one direction, and they occasionally 'lock up' and need the batteries reseated to work again. Now one controller won't even move in one direction.

Junk."
297361,1,Buggy hardly any servers available. Always ask for upgrades which means spending more Money. EA sucks.
18273,1,"The basic idea behind the game sounds fun. You're an SAS officer, sent off on a number of missions to save the world. It's a standard FPS shooter, made a bit more exiting by the 3D landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environments.
The emphasis is on ""real-world"" fighting - where taking a couple of shots will kill you, and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discovered.
There are plenty of gadgets to play with too. The Satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above, and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas. When you use the camera, the map is shown full-screen and the action caries on around you in ""real-time"". If you're not careful you can get killed while looking at the map.
This ""real-world"" emphasis can be great (try games like SWAT3), but the game designers need to finely balance ""reality"" with ""fun"". Unfortunately this is where Project IGI shoots itself in the foot (as it were).
I couldn't even get past the first level on ""normal"" difficulty. I'm not that bad at games (I've completed Half-life, Star Trek Elite Force etc.), but try as I might I couldn't get through the first mission. I'd get 5 minutes into the level and get shot by a sniper - there's no save game feature, so you have to go back to the start of the level. A boring 5 minutes spent working through the part of the level I'd already completed, shoot the sniper... and then got shot by someone else. Guess what ? Another 5 minutes going back over the exact same level again!
After I'd played through the same part of the same level 10 times I just got bored and went to play something more fun instead.
As far as the rest of the game goes, other than the outdoor maps, there is very little special about the graphics - they're pretty much Quake2 engine standard (sub Half-Life). All that running around, climbing ladders etc. is pretty passe these days (how old is Tomb Raider ?), and there is really nothing new that this game does.
I originally bought the game because PCGamer UK gave it a good review. As it stands, without a save game feature, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. If Eidos get around to patching the game (there's no sign of it yet), and adding the ability to save your progress within a mission I might start playing it again. As it stands, I'll stick with SWAT3 Elite Edition... ""The element is behind you!"" or Counterstrike.
Pro: 1. The satelite camera is quite cool. 2. Outdoor environments make a change from usual FPS.
Con 1. You cant save your game. 2. Too easy on ""easy"". 3. Impossible on any difficulty setting above ""easy"" (partly because there is no save game option). 4. No multiplayer. 5. Dodgy voice acting."
133042,1,"I loved the original Sim City and I thought Sim City 2000 was probably one of the best games for the PC ever... I also had Sim City 3000 which is where the buggy interface started detracting from the gameplay and I had Sim City 4 back when it originally came out and the game was basically unplayable. I had hoped after many years without thinking about it that they'd have 'fixed' the game but they haven't...

Sim City 4 Deluxe is too buggy to play... I had it on for just an hour or so and the game just closed, no warning, no opportunity to save... even during play setting up roads and water pipes aren't fun because things just don't work like they should- To get roads and highways to connect like you want is a real pain- this is a GAME it's supposed to be FUN- don't tell me these roads don't fit together- just MAKE THEM FIT... the same with rewards and special items like the Marina- it takes forever to find a suitable spot to place these things- once again- let me place them and let the game deal with whatever is has to to make them fit.

Worse then the play options was the setting up of the game... It takes 2 discs to install - the second disc however was bad/blank... my computers couldn't see ANY data on the disc and the install wouldn't complete- I had to borrow the 2nd disc from someone else to complete the install- if I didn't know someone with it I'd be out of luck.

Everything about this box is annoying like this... avoid it- this isn't the Sim City you remember. :(

Also laptop users- FYI- the outside of the box says that laptop video cards (even if they meet the 128 MB memory requirement) are NOT SUPPORTED- they may work, they may not and if they don't the publisher doesn't want to hear about it- so don't waste your money or time if you planned to use this on a laptop."
398631,1,"I was excited to try and bring back some memories with this new version of THPS, but this was a massive letdown. The graphics are poor, there's no ""create a skater,"" and worst of all, the mechanics were just terrible."
339108,1,"The controller is nice, very much like the real xbox controller, however big problem I ran into with this thing, the directional pad is stiffer than the nipples on a manikin, if they had nipples that is. It is so unresponsive, trying to play side scrollers or a game that utilizes the directional pad is beyond unbearable. You literally have to use the entire force of your thumb muscles in order to get some feed back from this thing. I don't know  if you guys will get a hit or miss if you are looking to purchase this controller. It sucks because I really wanted to like this controller too. :(."
213785,1,"Before anyone trolls me or tries to correct me, this is my opinion for the game. I will start by saying that I played this for about an hour. I have a stressful job to begin with. This game is the epitome of stress. It's chaotic and ultraviolent. It starts off a little slow... But the transition is quick. It goes from slow to full throttle in about 5 seconds, and stays at full throttle for the rest of the game. It's like driving a nice scenic route on the California coastline, but at 200 mph. So you miss the scenery, you miss the immersion, you just hold on for the hell of holding on.

It could have been more immersive. But the immersion is lost immediately. There are carnival games you can play and people to talk to in the first bit of the game. First bit being the first five minutes. However as soon as you pass through a certain gate, the mayhem begins.

The enemy AI is erratic at best. You're under attack from quite literally everyone. Police. Firemen. Gun turrets. Religious Zealots. And everyone has a gun. Why you're under attack is silly. You're the Anti-Christ. You get a pistol and shot gun and everyone else has either an assault rifle or a flame thrower. You're basically screwed from the get go.

There is no map. So you don't know where you're supposed to go. There is no sort of radar so the enemies have the upper hand no matter what. They outgun you in strength and numbers and you have no idea where they are. I get that some people may be into that sort of thing, but frankly I found it to be stressful and frustrating at best.

The controls are janky as all hell. You aim your gun by clicking the joystick you move with. So you either aim by accident or move while you're trying to aim. There are no sights on your guns either. So you basically shoot from the hip even if you aim.

Apparently you have psychic powers but using them is usually the result of pressing the wrong button thus using up the psychic powers and not having them available when you need them. I kept pressing the button that usually used for aiming (in EVERY OTHER FPS) only to find out that I've used up my psychic powers and now I can't hack that gun turret that's shooting me in the back.

They gaming itself was so shallow that I didn't even care about the story. So don't ask.

So I know a lot of people might read this and say that I suck at the game. In my opinion this game was just poorly designed. I played the first two Bioshocks. They were ok. They weren't great, but they were passable. This just pissed me off. I'm sure if this game came out 15 years ago, or for that matter 10 years ago, it'd be a great game and a classic at that. This was just a stressful heap of garbage."
350477,1,"The copy I received has incredibly poor quality case art, almost looks like someone printed it off a desktop printer that was low on ink.  After reading multiple other reviews pointing out that these may be fake, I didn't even bother opening it and just returned it for a refund.  I stopped in a big box store and looked at their version, and the quality difference is night and day.  My order was fulfilled by a third party, and not directly by Amazon so be aware when you're ordering."
25902,1,"I purchased this game because I'd played the original Jade Cocoon and liked it.  I'd already read reviews about Jade Cocoon 2, so I knew it wouldn't be like the original.  Still, I never expected it to be so bad.  I wasn't even able to finish the game.  I even picked it up again (after awhile of inactivity) to try to force myself to finish it, but I couldn't.  I really did consider finishing it to see if it got any better, but after reading numerous reviews/faqs/wikipedia, I realized that it wasn't going to get better.  So, rather than trudge through the rest of this abysmal game, I decided that I'd better quit before I wasted any more of my life.  I don't normally write reviews for games I haven't finished, but I really feel like I need to share my opinion on this one so I can inform others of what they might be getting into if they buy this game.  It's really not any one thing alone that makes this game unbearable; it's a combination of several things that bogs it down.  Well, let's take a look...

Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics themselves are technically decent, but not really too impressive.

Music (score 4/10): Ouch. Music is incredibly bland and generic. I almost didn't notice that there was music.  The voice actors try their best to invigorate the terrible dialogue, but many fail.  Furthermore, some voices chosen for characters were incredibly irritating--especially the voice of that guy who stores items for you.

Characters (score 4/10): Remember how I mentioned the crummy dialogue earlier?  Well, this really ruins the characters.  Dialogue is VERY repetitive (a lot like the rest of this game).  Kahu repeats every statement made to him back in the form of a question.  ""Kahu, you need to get the forest orbs."" --""So, I need to get the forest orbs?""  Urg!  This sort of exchange happens constantly.  Kahu seems to be amazingly stupid.  While other characters are amusing in a small way (like Yamu) it doesn't save this section from a poor score since most everyone is either gratuitously stupid or simply poorly developed.

Story (score 2/10): Talk about non-existent.  What little story that exists is incredibly trite.  Kahu wants to become a beast hunter but then he gets cursed for touching a fairy cocoon.  Now he must collect 4 forest orbs to lift the curse.  There are several subplots along the way, but none of them are particularly interesting.  The story really suffers from the pace of it (slow) and the way it's told.  The bits of story are revealed by talking to people in the dungeons.  Sometimes there is a scene (mostly monologues by the fairy Nico), but mostly it consists of simply exchanging a conversation.  There wouldn't be anything wrong with this if it were paced better.  But the game drags on and on forever, with a lot of level grinding.  This really slows the story to a snail's pace and makes you forget why you are even playing this game.  With all this you'd think the gameplay made up for it, right? Well, let's see.

Battle System (score 5/10): This part's not so bad, but it does have its irritating bits.  Selecting attacks is turn-based, and battle involves having several monsters arranged on a wheel surrounding Kahu.  They can only carry one move for each element, and then can only use the move of the element that they are placed on in the wheel.  Furthermore, you can't choose which enemy the monster attacks--it's random.  Plus, monsters can only use their moves that take up MP; they only use normal attacks once their MP runs out.  That makes for a frustrating experience. Otherwise, I would've been fine with the battle system.

Gameplay (score 1/10): Repetitive is the word of the day.  There is only one ""town"" (and it's dull).  Dungeons are long and boring, and each one looks just like the others, only a different color.  There was just no variety--and in a game that's basically a dungeon-crawler, this is bad.  To make matters worse, the monster raising system is very unrewarding.  When you merge a monster, the appearance doesn't even change (unlike the original Jade Cocoon).  Further, monsters stop leveling up at level 20, forcing you to merge them, which resets their levels to 1.  This really ruins any sense of accomplishment you had, because monsters revert to their weak-looking baby forms. It really sucks the fun out of the game.

Overall (score 2/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Sigh, the first couple hours of this game are really fun-- before you get sick of it, that is. I wasn't able to force myself to finish this game, and I don't see why I should have to.  A game is supposed to be for fun, not something I should force myself to do.  I just don't think I could recommend this game to anyone--except maybe the most diehard of dungeon-crawling fans."
324393,1,I wanted to play this game bad on a console. Only to find out you have to be connected to the internet. Screw you ms I'm not paying online just to play this game. Not very nice supporters for people that play offline.
396881,1,"I'm not really a gamer, more of a Star Wars Fan.  I really liked ""Shadows of the Empire"" back 20 years ago.  I don't play games online and I'm not much interested in multiplayer games.  I've played this game for about 2 days now, and it just consists of running around in circles killing enemies ad nauseum in shockingly constricted areas.  Haven't flown an X-wing (except in the tutorial), haven't driven an AT-AT.  The scenarios don't seem to have any objectives, other than pure killing.  Maybe once a Guidebook comes out I'll learn something about this game I can;t learn on my own.  So far it sucks."
117289,1,"Don't waste your money.  As frustrating as Wii Boxing can be .  I find the controls to be way more responsive in Wii Boxing.  At least in Wii Boxing I know when the punches are connecting but in Victorious Boxers missing a punch and connecting a punch seem the same to me.

The first 2 control options which use the remote and the nunchuck to punch seem to work fine in the tutorial but is a crap shoot during sparring.  I didn't even fell like wasting my time with the story mode at this point.

For now Wii Boxing with all of it's flaws is the ""King of the Ring"" as it is still way more fun and a lot less frustrating than Victorious Boxers.  Best to just wait for something else to come along."
261287,1,Would not recomend at all. Bad ideas after bad ideas. They are giving baseball games a bad reputation. Where is EA Sports!?
359294,1,"RATING: Awful

Horrendous framerate, repetitive quests, nonsensical story, glitched achievements (I beat the game on the hardest difficulty and received nothing), this is easily one of worst games I've ever played."
211649,1,Do not buy this. Do not buy this I repeat over and over. Right trigger does not work.  Total waste of money.  I learned my lesson the hard way. This controller needs to be taken off any sellers and junked
18158,1,"The first PE had problems - Aya's painfully slow movement, some bad camera angles, etc. - but was overall a good game.  This ... this is a travesty.
First, the movement system is *miserable*.  Character-relative movement is an abomination, painful, and results in many many deaths.  Second, Aya's Parasite powers are pathetic - how did she go from taking on Eve and the Ultimate Being to this!?  Eve would have turned this Aya into mincemeat.  Third, why is Aya suddenly young and dressing in bizarre fashion?  I dunno about you, but *I'd* wear body armor, or at least long pants, when confronted with creatures like that.
In terms of plot and characterization ... there isn't any that I had the patience to see.  Aya's sole reaction on seeing a human (or apparent human) mutate boils down to so what.  This, from a woman who freaked at seeing the rat mutate, who has not seen anything else mutate since finishing off the Ultimate Being ... who seemed to think nothing else was going to mutate.
Stupid puzzles, uninteresting secondary characters (where's Ben?  Maeda?  Daniel?  Wayne?) ...
Pass on this one.  Play the original again."
478981,1,"This game is hands down one of the worst shooters I've ever played.  Imagine a ""rail shooter"" in the arcades like House of the Dead or Time Crisis and you'll have some idea of what to expect here. Much like those games, you won't be able to control the movement of your character, so you'll automatically move from place to place. Along the ""rails"", you'll be expected to shoot any targets you see, but there's no strategy invovled.  Die, and you'll face the exact same path again, with the same targets in the same places.

In the middle of a battle, the camera will often spin in 180 degree turns to ""shock"" you by throwing another target in front of you. When you're in an arcade (or on a console with a light gun), this sort of ""twitch"" game can be fun. In light gun games, you aim a real gun at the screen, shoot characters, reload...rinse repeat.  Unfortunately, this game has no light gun....so you do all of this with the standard controller. The action in this game is sort of like being stuck in the Warthog turret in a game of Halo with a crazy driver who has never played the game before....except it's a lot less fun than that would be.

In Attack of the Movies 3D, you aim your gun with the thumbsticks, and the right one seems to work better than the left. Turning your controller upside down helps a bit with this I suppose, but why would you want to play a game that requires that?  Needless to say, aiming is difficult, and the thumbsticks are no substitute for a real light gun. The ""3D"" levels are a joke (it's the old cardboard red and blue glasses and I thought the game looked better without them). Speaking of the graphics, this looks like a PS2 game...or maybe something for the Wii. Don't waste your money on this game, unless you are morbidly curious to see what one of the worst shooters of all time will feel like. Even if that's the case....try to find a rental copy, because after 15 minutes, you'll want to return it."

The packaging for $139 is mostly cheap plastic, not a cool box like I'm used to from Razer.  The mouse is neat.  Feels a little big but I imagine that's to do with all the buttons on the side.

Where you run into the problem is when you update and load the software.  Then you CANNOT save your setup.  The LED can be changed to any color you'd like, but every time you exit that program or reboot, its back to default.  What is the point of having a mouse with configurable buttons and no ability to save your setup?

You've got all those buttons but no matter how you program them they will just go back to default.

Their website is atrocius for trying to find a fix.  It looks cool (but the faction insignia is always yellow so it doesn't match the mouse wheel), and might be good, but since they apparently don't beta test their firmware upgrades, its a nice doorstop.  I'll just stick with my logitech which is smaller and cheaper.

Why I won't be returning it is because of the 2 per character exclusive green-black color crystals.  So they got my money and will keep it.

So I gave it 1 out of 5 since it's non-functional as a programable mouse.  But its Star Wars and it looks cool.

360879,1,"This game was the reason I bought my Xbox One (to go with my PS4 that I've had since launch). It's now the reason I'm selling the console back. For some background, When I was 12-13 years old I played Halo: CE and here and there played Halo 2 with friends that owned the game. I spent maybe 15-20 hours on the original Halo games included in the MCC. Also, I did play the s*** out of Halo: Reach and it remains one of my favorite games to date. I had high expectations for the MCC because of Reach and have been severely disappointed.

As of 12/1/14:

* Multiplayer is screwed up. I've been able to get into 4 matches. One was 5v2, one 2v0, one 1v0. The last was actually 8v8 and it was fun, but I don't think I'd be playing it much. The red vs blue gives a very old vibe that is fairly boring.

* Graphics look good compared to the original games, but I expected a lot more. Compared to newer great looking games like Destiny, Assassins Creed (Black Flag... haven't tried Unity), and even The Last of Us, Halo graphics are kinda pathetic.

* Texturing... ugh. I've never thought I cared much about texturing until I played this game. Halo MCC looks sparse and bland, especially CE and 2.

* This might be a little controversial to some of you, but I do not care for the campaigns. Halo: Reach's story was absolutely amazing and I was totally engrossed in the probably 12 times I played through it. I feel almost bored going through CE, 2, 3, and 4 missions. Out of them all, I'm enjoying 2 and 3 the most.

* Playing with friends can be a frustrating experience when connecting with one another. Some kinks need to be worked out where if the party leader leaves a mission (or a multiplayer lobby), the rest of the group should too. There are lots of little problems like that. Also, it takes a long time for the friends list to even load and sometimes friends that I'm chatting with in a party (and are in game) do not appear on the list.

* I am not happy with the control setups available to me. I've been playing a good bit of Destiny and BF4, and going to Halo controls has been an annoying experience. I'd very much like to be able to assign my own controls how I like them if popular layouts aren't offered.

* Actual gunplay is frustrating. I like having a very precise reticle so I know exactly what I'm shooting at (mostly for headshots) and the reticles in Halo MCC aren't fulfilling. Other games, I usually kill with headshots 70% of the time in multiplayer and 80-90% in single player/coop. In Halo, single player/coop is probably around 20%.

I'm usually a skeptic so spending $60 on all this amazing content that was being advertised was pretty out-of-character and it should have been a red flag. I'll not make that mistake again. I will say that if you are a big fan of Halo, you'll probably eat this game up and love it. But for those of you who don't have an attachment to previous Halo games and are looking for current-gen quality, don't get your hopes up. If they fix the problems and the price goes down to $30ish, you should buy this game. But this game alone should not affect your decision between X1 and PS4."

EDITEDIT:  Patch 4 update 10/16/13 at bottom

It's been about a week, and I still don't feel I can fully put into words my complicated feelings about this game.

So much of it, for me, is a comparison with previous games.  Rome Total War was one of the best of the franchise, only superseded by Medieval II Total War, which was essentially the exact same game, but with more features and better graphics.

The best I can say for Rome 2 is that it's better than Empire Total War and Napoleon Total War, though that's not really saying much.

As well, it took this game for me to realize that, aside from Medieval II, Total War Shogun 2 was the best of the ""modern"" Total War games, with a truly engaging campaign map that was short and well-defined (25 years or so over 200 turns in the main game, 10 years over 200 turns in Fall of the Samurai) giving you plenty of time to work with your family members and agents and overall policy for your clan.  Battles were actually discernible and fun to watch, particularly as each individual unit seemed to be able to lock on to an enemy or two, with some groups getting into mini-duels with a single opponent, often to have one of their comrades step in and abruptly end it with a quick stab to the other duelist.  There was enough of an RPG element and a balance in AI (to some degree) so that you could predict which clans would behave stupidly, and which would maintain strong alliances.

Rome 2 doesn't deviate too far from this setup, and is much more like Shogun 2 than the original Rome Total War.  But something about it just doesn't work.

For one, there's the passage of time.  Shogun 2 worked because there was plenty of time to do stuff in a year's time in-game, so you could decide the fate of your clan within a period of just a year or two, or even draw out a war of attrition into something that could span a decade.  In Rome 2, each turn has 1 year pass.  Combining this with the incredibly slow movement of units on the campaign map, and you have a situation less like the first game and more similar to Medieval II's campaign map, where a journey which should take months ends up taking almost a decade or more.

Medieval II was trying to cram 500 years of Medieval history into a 200 turn game, and compensated by having the game mechanics operate on a 2 turns per year system (much like RTW).  This means that characters and agents aged at a rate of 6 months per turn, which could make it ridiculous to have a King reign for 200 years and only be 80 or so.  But in Rome 2, characters age with the turns, so the vast majority of your generals, admirals, named characters, and agents, will be well into their middle ages by the time they're accomplished generals, even if they are fighting in frequent wars.

Nothing in the game allows for this 1 turn per year to be even remotely realistic, and given that such an emphasis is now placed on generals (ie, you NEED a general or an admiral in order to lead armies) you may as well not even bother polishing and grooming them into being your game's Caesar or Alexander or Alcibiades, because they'll die of old age by the time they've got a full army and plenty of battle experience.

This effect was somewhat similar in Rome Total War (2turns per year), yet there you had the versatility of a Family Tree---it wouldn't be wise to focus on a single character, but you could polish and groom him and his children, and establish a veritable dynasty of men that you craft to be master generals or master administrators or master politicians, even going so far as to pass down ancillaries (like tutors, mentors, pet dogs, family heirlooms, custom armor, sacred artifacts) from generation to generation, and feel a genuine sense of loss if that family member dies without passing on the ancillaries.

In Rome 2, there's absolutely none of that.  No family tree, no valuable ancillaries you could risk losing, nothing particularly special other than the exact same trees of traits you can pick for characters that contribute virtually nothing to the character.  Whereas in Rome Total War, a character could have a foul temper, and have it affect his influence, or a mental illness which affects his troops' morale, in Rome 2, there's only room for 3 traits that come entirely at random, followed by skills that add to things like ""zeal"", ""authority"", and  which contribute little to nothing to the character at all, particularly since they die of old age so quickly.

The campaigns themselves are another disastrous mess...

One of my worries about modding the game (particularly to increase the number of turns per year) was the risk of too-fast growth and expansion.  For example, Medieval II Total War was designed to be 2 years per turn, and so the growth of cities reflects the sort of gradual growth that would span centuries, even if named characters live much longer than humanly possible.  No matter how fast you grew or conquered, you were unlikely to trigger such events as the discovery of Gunpowder or the recruiting of Plate-armored Knights by the 1100s, whereas if you decreased the years in each turn, you could see your nation conquer half of Europe with musketmen and cannons, and an expedition heading to America by 1200 AD.

Even in Rome Total War, whereas in real history, Rome expanded in fits and spurts, rapidly expanding during certain war periods, and remaining steady and consolidating their gains over decades, so that the breakdown of the Republic occurred by the 80s BC, in-game, you could easily consolidate your gains, and spark an End-Game situation as early as the 190s BC, and see Rome dominating everything west of Greece by 140s BC, facing off against the Seleucids or Egypt or Parthia dominating everything east of Greece.

Despite this, it appears my fears are somewhat unfounded in this game, not just due to the poor pacing and slow movement of everything, but due to two factors; AI passivity and the horrendous new Province/Settlement system.

The game AI is no better or worse than average for Total War, except that in the campaign map, everyone seems so idle and passive.  More than 100 turns into the game, no one has ever declared war on me out of the blue, and of the dozen or so factions that have been wiped out, more than half of them were wiped out by me and my expansion.  I feel that I could easily set this to last 500 turns, 4 turns per year, and little would change over the scope of the campaign without my interference.

This doesn't bother me -too- much, but this is a Total War game, not a Civilization game.  This is a problem of trying to fit so much history into a single campaign.  I feel that Medieval Total War did it best, by having three separate campaigns divided by era----early, high, and late.  Even Shogun 2 did it, albeit with DLC and expansion packs, between Rise of the Samurai in the 1170s AD, Sengoku Jidai in 1575-1600, and Fall of the Samurai in 1867-1877 AD.

I feel like if the game had divided into three different eras of Roman history, they could have contained as much as they wanted to in scope, while making the game much more of an aggressive ""Total War"" type game.

As for the Settlement/Province system...

Rome and Medieval II Total War let you build any type of building in any type of settlement, restricted only by population growth and city expansion---you couldn't build huge barracks and mansions in a village of 400 people, but if it grew to 25,000 you could.

By Empire and Napoleon Total War, settlements were reduced to a pre-determined size, with only 5-6 building slots, requiring you to diversify your regions, so one settlement would specialize in infantry, another in cavalry, another in artillery, another in farming, etcetera.  This continued into Shogun 2, with the added bonus of bringing back city expansion, opening up more slots for you to add to your settlements.

Rome 2 has the same thing, but has reduced it down to a sharp scale, to where most settlements will only be able to have 3 buildings, with other settlements able to expand to add another building slot with enough population growth, but there's no clear reason as to why some settlements can grow, and others mysteriously can't.

The map is divided into ""Provinces"" which consist of 2-5 individual settlements, all connected to one another based solely upon the arbitrary delineation of the game creators.  Whereas Athens and Sparta were so fundamentally different that they spoke different dialects of Greek almost unrecognizable to one another, they are lumped together into the province of Hellas for the sole convenience of distance, with the island of Crete added along because the game creators said so.

What this means is that each settlement in the province is linked together.  Whereas in previous games, unhappiness and squalor varied depending on individual cities, as is basic common sense, now it is distributed amongst the settlements, so if one settlement is rich and luxurious, and its neighbor is a slum-ridden wasteland, people will riot in the rich and luxurious settlement, because the game creators said so.

Speaking of unhappiness and squalor...

I really don't even need to say much, but for the sake of a review, I will.  Perhaps the primary cause of the aforementioned timid and passive AI is the ridiculous heaps of squalor from improving virtually every building.

Much of this system seems to borrow heavily from Civilization 5, which as I mentioned in my review of it, actually PUNISHES and PENALIZES you for EXPANDING and GROWING your empire.  It rewards stagnation and not building anything more than necessary to live.

Similarly here, all the basic buildings enable basic services (Farms produce food, field camps produce militia troops, consecrated sites provide order bonuses and culture spread, ports provide basic ships and trade), but the more you upgrade them, the more they penalize you in terms of squalor or food.

EVERY food building (farm, animal herds, fishing ports) will produce tremendous squalor as higher levels.  Squalor contributes DIRECTLY to unhappiness in this game, as opposed to being a percentage of unhappiness that would come together with all the other factors.

EVERY building that isn't food will consume large amounts of food to build, which in turn means you'll need more food buildings, or else you'll have starvation across provinces, which will lead to steep declines in happiness anyway.

So basically, you're PENALIZED for naturally growing and expanding.  Not rushing through anything (you need to research higher and higher level technologies to unlock certain buildings), not cheating to add tons of gold to build the higher level buildings quickly, not doing anything to exploit the in-game system; you are PENALIZED for ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME.

This causes madcap situations like having your lush, well-fed, barely-taxed home region fall into anarchy and rebellion while a region you are freshly conquering is happy and joyous because you've just started building and you've got your full armies stationed there.

Playing as Athens, I had secured all of Greece and Macedonia, made the lunge into Sicily and Italy, and was pacifying northern Italy, wiping out Rome, when suddenly I get the word that Hellas (Athens, Sparta, Hierapytna) was miserable, and public order was plummeting by the double digits.  Squalor?  Massive.  Build up farming and markets?  More squalor.  Build up a fishing port, a trading port, or a naval port?  More squalor.  A barracks to train soldiers?  More squalor.  A brand new plumbing system to help clean up squalor?  LESS FOOD.  How the hell do stone aqueducts cost FOOD?  They're made of STONE, not meat!

And there's no real explanation as to what actually affects public order in any real way.  Whereas in previous games, you could see each individual settlement information, see how religion/culture penalties stacked up with unhappiness over high taxes, stacked up with squalor and/or boredom or unrest over having an army occupy them, and understand why the settlement is in turmoil, and MOST OF ALL, know exactly what to do to alleviate it.

For example, you could check a settlement to see that squalor was contributing to 80% of the unhappiness, and the tax burden contributing to 30% (leading to a -10% public order rate), you would know to build buildings that dealt with squalor to attack the big problem first.

In Rome 2, you're informed of the benefits and problems caused by taxes, culture, etcetera, even from high slave populations, but a whole other variable is left there as a general ""Who the Hell Knows"" in the form of ""Provincial Instability""

What causes it?  Who the hell knows.  In the aforementioned situation, Hellas was built up, and well-fed, with taxes at their absolute lowest settings.  Provincial Instability combined with the massive Squalor and plunged Hellas' public order down more and more every single turn, until it revolted and was quickly put down.  From there, Provincial Instability briefly disappeared.  Meanwhile, most of my armies were in Italy, and Italy was at full 100% public order, with NO provincial instability despite being recently conquered, and virtually identical to Hellas in terms of building diversity.

Again and again throughout the campaign, ""Provincial Instability"" strikes provinces entirely at random, with no explanation as to what is causing it.  I can be completely at peace, with three client states under me, and plenty of food coming in, very low taxes, and coffers bursting with tens of thousands of talents of gold, and suddenly a region will stop growing due to low public order and eventually revolt unless I send one of my armies to boost the Military Presence score.

Speaking of military, the new system seems to go straight to Marian-era private armies, where generals recruit soldiers directly.  You need them to be in a certain settlement with the right barracks or workshops to get the better quality units and weapons, but ultimately you can't train a small task force to just hang around without appointing a general to it, and you can't leave a full stack of versatile heavy infantry to defend a border town; garrisons are automatically deployed when attacked, and you need a general-led army in town to add to the defense.

The new Unit Cards are also horribly done.  In every previous game up until Shogun 2, they used mini screenshots of the actual video game unit, as it appears on the field.  In Shogun 2, they went for stylized drawings of the units, or stylized pictures resembling daguerreotype photographs for Fall of the Samurai.

The drawings here are so cheap and lazy, it's almost impossible to tell the difference between certain units.  If it weren't for the names popping up when you hover over them, you'd barely even be able to tell the difference between Hastati and Principes, Hoplites and Pikemen and Thorax Pikemen, Javelinmen and Slingers (?!), and so on.  At some point, you don't even bother recognizing the units by name or armor/weapons, but by broad shapes in the UIs---you know this is a ballista because it looks like a bow, you know this is a cavalry trooper because it has a horse-looking thing in it, you know this is a higher-level legionary because the helmet is shaped differently.

The UI as well is an utter mess that hides valuable information in slide-up tabs that appear when you click on settlements or armies, and which hides the Event Log in a decision I cannot even imagine making any sort of sense at all.  You have to manually open the event log most of the time, only to find that it is unevenly spaced with the rest of the UI, causing it to take up a huge part of the screen.

Then there's agents.  Much like Shogun 2, they charge money to do their jobs that you hire them for to begin with, and by and large they're mostly useless, meant either to assassinate one another or give minor bonuses to your own army.

The last major issue with the campaign is the factions system.  I've only played as Athens thus far, so I can't speak for how well it works with divided nations like Rome and Carthage.  Much like Rome Total War, you play as families (properly named now, House of Julia, Junia, Cornelia) which end up controlling the entirety of Rome, so there aren't multiple Roman factions on the map, which is good, I suppose, and better represents the coming civil war.

But what I don't understand for Athens at least is the whole point of having factions which are apparently hostile to one another, and to which I am actively a member of one, along with controlling the entire nation of Athens.

Basically, there are ""Oligarchs"" and ""Magistrates"".  I didn't get to choose, I was automatically made a Magistrate.  I had to suffer the Oligarchs trying to assassinate my own generals and family members, sometimes succeeding, and my having absolutely no control over their actions, save to try to do the same to them.

Except, like I said before, I CONTROL ALL OF ATHENS.  Meaning I can appoint Oligarch faction members to the heads of armies.  Even armies only 100 men strong.  I can then send that tiny army straight into the Sahara desert and wait until they die of attrition, or the Numidians get sufficiently enraged by my trespassing that they attack and kill them.  Literally nothing stops me from doing this because there is no repercussion, no benefit, no sense that this factionalism is even affecting my campaign at all beyond aggravating me by having experienced generals suddenly drop dead or get put out of action for 5 years, wounded from a botched assassination attempt.

Now, to the battles.

In true ""vanilla"" Total War style, they are fast, wild, and typically over quickly.  Completely out of the norm for Total War style, units now don't even bother to stay in formation when fighting, opting instead to go Hollywood-style one-man-army Drunken Titus Pullo Breaking Rank And Forcing Lucius Vorenus To Have Him Whipped For Disobeying And Assaulting Him.  The worst part is, the Hoplites actually have a Phalanx formation, and can move in phalanx formation.  Though if I order them to run, they will immediately break Phalanx formation.  So I try to keep them walking.  They STILL break phalanx formation as soon as they reach the enemy line.

I've already seen the term ""Blob"" used to describe these battles in Rome 2, where units simply pile on to each other, with seeming disregard for physics, into massive balls.  I haven't seen it happen frequently, though that may just be because enemy units tend to rout quickly, long before I can pile in enough troops to make a blob.

Literally no previous Total War game from Rome to Shogun 2 has been this bad in terms of unit spacing and formation.  In all those games, units maintained formation as much as their discipline and training allowed, and if soldiers were standing side by side, filling a small area with their bodies, you could not cram in MORE soldiers to stand next to them like you can in this game.

Winding down with one of the major complaints, graphics.  It looks pretty, though the decision on coloring seems to be odd, depending largely on lighting.  Compared to Shogun 2, soldiers are in bright, bold colors, sometimes incongruent, looking like a line of ketchup and mustard bottles for a Roman line.

As well, the campaign map is massive, and apparently more detailed than Shogun 2.  I only assume so because, while Shogun 2's campaign map runs smoothly on my high-powered computer all the time, Rome 2's campaign map is constantly refreshing textures when I move the map around.  I can center in on Greece, move over to Italy, have Italy's textures appear flat and pixelated and quickly rebuff to their high quality settings, then scroll back to Greece and have its textures appear flat and pixelated as well, before rebuffing to high quality.  Aside from this, everything runs smoothly and quickly.

Except for loading times.

Even basic, small-scale battles take twice as long to load up as battles did in Shogun 2, despite there being no noticeable difference in memory or graphical strain on my system, and the dreaded End Turn can take as long as 2 minutes, even early into the game.  It makes it impossible to become immersed in the campaign gameplay, as each turn wastes away, with bogged down End Turn times forcing you to either watch the computer units meander about aimlessly, or find something to distract you until it's your turn again.

Another review of the game by Rowan Kaiser from ArsTechnica perfectly sums up this experience:

""In most grand strategy games, the motivation to play ""just one more turn"" is the most appealing part. In Total War: Rome II, ""just one more turn"" is a threat.""

****PATCH 4 UPDATE****

I hadn't touched the game since October 6th, but boredom overcame, and so I looked to finish my grueling Athenian campaign, currently post-turn 300 because the victory conditions are obscenely long, and by which standards even the Roman Empire wouldn't reach (I currently control about as much land, if not more than Rome at its height, which consists of some 120 settlements, when I need 140 for victory.  Alternately, I need 90 settlements and 20 trade agreements for an economic victory, but GOOD LUCK GETTING 20 TRADE PARTNERS THIS LATE IN THE GAME).

Basically, the only changes I've noticed are cosmetic.  The biggest change from Patch 1 was that the End Turn time was sharply reduced, and loading times between battles or loading saves is similarly reduced.  Some icons were fixed, or expanded upon to provide better information, and naval units now have symbols representing their upgraded hulls.

Despite the reportedly hundreds of changes made, my earlier statement (and the title of my Civ5 review) still rings true for this game---shiny new expansions and patches can't fix a rotten foundation.

- If there were ANY improvements to AI, I haven't seen them yet, or I may have to start up a whole new campaign, because the Campaign AI is essentially DOA---literally no faction declares war on me, the player, and they are ALWAYS begging for money in exchange for meaningless Non-Aggression Pacts (meaningless because they never declare war on me anyway), or trade agreements they break off turns later due to losing their trading port, or a general hissy fit.  Similarly, they seem completely, blissfully ignorant of your or any other AI's movements.

It seemingly makes sense for the player character to not be able to see the entirety of the map right away (it would cause utter hell on End Turn times, as well), but a staple of the series has tended to be that AI would recognize when their borders were weak; it would build up armies or keep them close by to borders with other factions.  This is given even MORE opportunity in Rome 2 by allowing you to walk through other nations' lands without having to declare war or seek military access, though by doing so you anger the nation and risk provoking conflict.

But since the AI never declares war on you, you're free to squat 6 armies on top of an enemy city and watch as they mewl and do nothing.  They don't even bring up their own armies to try to passive-aggressively urge you to leave.  As such, if you're planning to take over every settlement owned by a faction, you can freely move your armies into position to blitz them within 1 turn, and the AI won't do a thing to stop you, or even pretend to be concerned.

Yet by the same (lack of) logic, the AI will break off trade agreements with you if they feel you're getting too rich or too close to economic victory.

- Battle AI.  I firmly believe that so long as those EFFing flags are there, the battle AI will remain fundamentally broken at the basest level.  In prior games, siege battles had a ""flag"" in the form of a town square, but the AI was seemingly more focused upon actually fighting out a battle---their main force would besiege, attack your defending forces, then if they had backup or reinforcements on the other side of the settlement, would slip in from the rear and take the town square WHILE KEEPING your forces occupied.

Instead in this game, practically the exact opposite happens; the force deployed to attack your defense forces will SIT and WAIT for their ""secret reserves"" to slip in and snatch the town square, allowing you full momentum to bring virtually your entire army to smash that backup force, then sit and wait for 50 minutes as the enemy besiegers stand there and wait for the now-destroyed force to steal the victory for them.  Most of the time, they will send a few siege engines to at least try to attack your forces, but if the first wave fails, they don't even bother trying again.  And this is a NEW PROBLEM---enemies would ALWAYS attack in siege battles for as long as they had siege equipment!  The battle would automatically end in victory for you if the enemy's siege towers and/or battering rams were set on fire and destroyed; it even encouraged the AI to build more ladders, since they could never be destroyed.

But since only settlement capitals have walls now, the vast majority of siege battles are essentially village defenses like in prior games where your settlement didn't even have a basic wooden palisade up.  Here, the enemy AI is entirely fixated on that EFFing flag.  Every single siege defense battle I have played, from day 1, to patch 4, has consisted of the enemy rushing ALL their troops forward against one of my lines, throwing ALL their infantry and cavalry into my units, IGNORING THEM, and trying to rush PAST them to get to my EFFing flag.  This has caused victories which saw my garrison forces of less than 1000 win heroic victories against enemy forces 4 and 5 times larger, simply because the enemy ran into my spears, and kept trying to run, rather than bothering to stop and fight.

All these factors coming together, combined with the release-day bugs, the reportedly 40% larger (than any prior TW game) budget, and the breath-taking arrogance from the marketing side, makes this whole game, even now more than a month after release and 4 patches adding up to hundreds of megabytes of more data, an unmitigated failure of game play design."

484940,1,"Sadly, this cable lasted only a couple of months before it stopped working completely.  It was always cared for and never abused, so this was a pretty big disappointment.

I would steer clear of this one.  Wish I would have paid the few extra bucks for the genuine Sony."
227176,1,This product is not only crap but dangerous. I've had it 3 months and it broke. I woke up to a burning smell. It wasn't until later I realized it was coming from this. I went to charge my wiimote and it wasn't lit up like usual. After looking closer the plastic is melted on the bottom. I was lucky it didn't catch fire. Don't buy this unless you want to burn your house down. Additionally before it broke it wouldn't hold a charge for long at all
272948,1,"The maker of this game has released an awful product.

Don't get me wrong. The game's content itself is very good, very engrossing and emotional.

But the game is a lemon. It has far beyond the typical glitches (freeze-ups, slowdown, etc.) that one may encounter with games; the game is ultimately unplayable.

There are all sorts of problems, such as being unable to play later episodes and losing one's game saves, which given the nature of this game, is enough to drive one crazy.

It takes a lot of time, devotion and emotional investment to get through what is otherwise a great, deep game. And to lose that all because the product itself is shoddy is beyond disappointing.

I highly suggest no one buy this game until they release a new version (one that works) or they iron out all the huge bugs. They released a patch recently, but it only worked temporarily.

Buyer beware..."
91745,1,"This game is not worth buying. I'm not even sure if this game is worth renting. If you have played GTA San Andreas it is pretty much the same thing. It's a sequel so I guess it should be. There just aren't enough new things in this game to justify purchases.

If you have never a GTA, then you should rent it and see how the gameplay is. You pretty much drive from one location to the next and complete missions...kinda of boring missions too."

330960,1,"EA, we are disappointed with your cynically manipulative approach to customers. SimCity was badly broken and you have told us repeatedly that you have no plans to fix it - that large cities, for instance, are impossible. Not only have your statements been misleading on a technical level but they also underscore the essential laziness that defines your approach to gaming. Cash farming is what EA does best, and Cities of Tomorrow perpetuates the long-standing tradition. Overpriced and without fixes to the core problems of the original, you're not getting much out of this.

You're paying EA to rent (not own) a copy of a badly broken game. You're paying to be constantly checked in upon to make sure you're not pirating or cheating or (worst of all) playing offline.

You can encourage this manipulation or you can go play something else. Your choice."
58536,1,"I bought the Xbox version and was disappointed to see that the schedules are generated incorrectly after the first season. I bought the PS2 version -- same crap! How can you suckers out there possibly say Madden 05 is going to be dethroned? Are you complete idiots? Look morons, the NFC West plays the NFC South this season. In season two the NFC West should play the NFC East. In season three the NFC West should play the NFC North. IT NEVER HAPPENS!!! THE NFC WEST KEEPS PLAYING THE NFC SOUTH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!! That means counting the division opponets you get only six different opponets a season when you should get at least ten. ESPN knows much about presentation, but nothing about how NFL schedules work. The game is fun in year one, but after that all of you simulation fans will be gravely disappointed. If you're a moron who doesn't know any better this game is for you. There is no f! cking way in h! ll this game is better than Madden 05 and the beautiful thing about it is that I don't even have to play Madden 05 to know that (it isn't released yet). SEGA got $39.98 out of me so I guess I'm just as much of a sucker as the rest of you nitwits who write reviews before you thoroughly investigate a game. Just about all of this game's features are pointless -- the practice sessions that bring your stats down instead of up (so much for practice), the crib (dumb), the ""player of the game"" interviews (an endless cliche spewing machine). Soon you will be pressing the button to skip all of them to start the next game and shutting off the ""Weekly Preparation"" option. Dethrone Madden???? Yeah, right. SEGA can't even make a f! cking schedule right and that has been a problem with their football games since the Dreamcast. All of you out there will vote that this review didn't help you and even write counter reviews debating this issue. You've got to get the schedules right to be a serious contender. This game could've been, should've been, but it's never going to be. You can't polish a turd."
259415,1,"Do not waste your hard waned money on this game.  I loved the series but Stronghold 3 is rotten.  First of all there is no skirmish mode, which basically means no replay value and no fun.  Second, the game is so filled with bugs that I could not list all of them here.  You will not be able to get thru one of the pre made games without batting it.  Just take my word and the word of all the others that wasted their money and buy a game that is fun."
355755,1,"Ubisoft is now claiming that the game is simply NOT SUPPORTED ON LAPTOPS.  I Googled minimum specs before purchasing the game and no websites that I could find, including an official Ubisoft blog listing the specs, mention that the game is not supported on laptops.  This Amazon store, which Ubisoft owns, doesn't mention this either.  Now they tell me it's on the box (which you obviously don't get with an online code), and it's in some obscure FAQ that doesn't even appear in the first page of Google results when you Google ""Far Cry 4 specs.""  I've asked them for a refund, but what I just said about the box and FAQ...was their response.  So in my opinion this is consumer fraud, affecting virtually anyone who purchases this game for their laptop."

137123,1,"Its a shame I'm bothering to mention a thing about the game.  Its garbage and its recycled garbage at that- the most economical kind (read as: exploitable kind for publishers).  The story is literally broken.  Everything ended after Bioshock presumably with you saving the little sisters or not- everyone is dead you survived- end of story.  Their is no reason to bridge a gap here, none at all.  I've heard rumors about the DRM on the PC version and being an owner of the first game (as well as system shock 1 for DOS and System shock 2) it irked me to some degree that an active connection was required to ""play"" the game I ""payed"" money to own.  Their is no logic here- I ""pay"" for services like cable because I do not own a server warehouse and am not my own internet provider.  So naturally if i buy a product made for a purpose (like a video game or movie) I now am the owner of said product period.  Why should their be the need to ""activate"" a product you've bought?  What if they started doing this with movies, e-books, and cd's?  What would be the general reaction to this?  Probably betrayal and after playing what I had already of Bioshock 2 on a friends PC I'm inclined to say that it was made to turn a buck or two.  Even worse is that its security methods are even more disturbing and riding the line somewhere between retail and digital distribution.  That's a dangerous place to be right now for us ""the consumer"" who can easily keep greedy men from getting paid at all.  Simply don't subscribe to the method and don't pay for the insult."

275590,1,"This is a perfect example of expectations not aligning with reality. Our family purchased an Xbox 360 (our first console) a couple years ago for our sons (now ages 10 and 8). We have the Kinect but we've never played a game that required its own controller, much less one shaped like a hunting rifle.

My expectation: I was hoping for a hunting simulation that I could use to gauge my sons' interest in deer hunting and, more importantly, enrollment in a hunter's safety course. I thought the game would teach the importance of patience (don't take the shot until you're ready) and the value of stealth (be quiet, you'll scare them away).

The reality: Packs/herds/groups of animals relentlessly charged at the screen with claws and fangs bared. Our mission was to slaughter as many animals as quickly as possible, so quickly in fact that we the gameplay never stopped to see whether any single hit was a kill shot.

The technical points:
* The all-new Top Shot Fearmaster tracks your heart rate, adjusting the game conditions and environment accordingly.
* The Top Shot Fearmaster intermittently loses its sync and either lags or misses the shot.
* The decorative sight serves only as a reminder of how a real rifle should be used and treated with respect.
* The two-player mode (all-new split screen Maneater mode) wasn't nearly as much fun as other two-player games with a split screen (both Halo 4 and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minecraft/dp/B00BU3ZLJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minecraft</a>&nbsp;come to mind.)

In summary, it was not love at first sight. While the two-brothers storyline sounded appealing on the back of the game box, the gameplay itself was not what we expected or enjoyed.

67759,1,"I purchased this game used for less than ten dollars and I paid way too much.

As other people have said, it is short.  Actually, this is a godsend.  Had it been a full length game, the drag factor would have been incredible.  I quit after the standing stones.

My son, on the other hand, has battled into the Sixth Sorrow and discovered (to his own sorrow) that whatever it takes to unlock those four stomping manikins is not worth the effort.  If they pound on the floor often enough, does it break and let you through?

At any rate...  this is a flusher, or a gift for an enemy."

496078,1,I am on beginner and get my butt kicked. The AI stamina hardly moves yet mine drops to nothing after 3 swings. I REALLY am disappointed. The controls are by far the hardest to use than any fighting game I have ever played. Can't imagine if I played on expert!
456856,1,Not Good
291195,1,"* Not worth new-release cost!
* Knack game has no manual, and I can't figure out how to play 2 players.
* Online manual just says ""Grab an extra DS4 controller and get a friend to lend a helping hand..."", nothing on how to actually join the game.
* After googling and not finding the answer. I figured it out. One of the players HAS to be a PSN account that is logged in.
* Knack requires 37 GB to install, yet still requires the disc to play. Likely normal. sad. Should be a way to register the game and run the install without the disc.
* Co-op mode is terrible. It should be called something else. It is really just a single player game. If the 2nd player joins and dies. They do not automatically re-spawn, they have to wait for a timer to expire and then press a button to return.
* Camera only follows player 1 and if player 2 goes off the screen, they time out and die. If player 1 dies and player 2 is still alive, it doesn't matter. It acts like both had died and forces you back to a check point.
* For a Sony launch title, the graphics are NOT good. Feels like an older PS3 game.
* Even as a single player game, the actual game play is very boring and the story isn't good so far. Many elements feel like Jax and Daxter from the PS2. And I love that game. But this is a poor imitation.

I wasn't expecting anything amazing. I simply wanted a decent 2 player platformer. As a 2 player game, it's one of the worse I have played. As a single player game, it's just no fun. Even my 7 and 9 year old kids are annoyed by this game. And I thought Disney's Universe for the PS3 was bad. As flaw as that game is, it's better than Knack.

My pain and frustration is made worse by the fact I paid full price for this on release day. Ouch.

IGN gave it a 5.9 out of 10, and I think that is being generous. If you really feel you need this game, at least wait for the cost to drop... a lot!

If you have any questions for me about this game, make a comment. I normally check reviews before I buy a game. But I wanted something to play when I got the PS4 on launch day and coming from Sony and all the hype, I expected this to at least be decent to hold me off until I figured out some other games.

Remember, I bought this game specifically for 2 player mode. And so I am giving it 1 star for that fail alone. For single player action, it's a 2 or 3 star game so far. But certainly still far below my expectations from Sony with all the hype. And even at 3 stars tops from me, that isn't good enough for a $60 new-release cost.

UPDATE: I still can't stand the co-op play on this game. I still feel it's a 1 star if you want this game for 2 players. And it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars for single player. I finally had a chance to try the Android companion game for Knack and that is awful. Some people are still very polarized on this game. But many reviews agree with me. It's not masterpiece it was hyped to be. Almost a year since it's release and the price is still too high. I would really wait for this to drop below $20 before trying it out. If you are still interested.

Many people have said this review is not helpful. I am curious as to why. The only thing I can think of, is that is their way of disagreeing with my opinion. Comments are a better place for that. As my title says, this review is based heavily on the Co-op aspect of the game."
204424,1,"Normally I wouldn't write a review for games but destiny was so bad I didn't want other people wasting their hard earned cash

Not everybody knows that:
You cannot play this offline
You need a constant connection to the destiny servers which is very unreliable get ready for your game to be interrupted even with a good connection.
You need to reach level 5 before you can do multiplayer.
This is not a proper mmo like eve online
You will need over 5 gig left on your harddrive to play.
Despite all the hype prepares to be underwhelmed both by the lack of depth of the story or any real action do not believe the trailers.

This is not open world or sandbox there's nothing to explore you go on these dull missions kill someone then go back to the tower.
Also the story ends at the introduction and only gets mentioned every now and again

Story
I really wanted this to be good but alas it's just not worth your time an empty lonely game experience with a story that could have been amazing. If you're a story driven person I'm afraid like many online only games the main story just becomes a back story it's so sad.

Action
Also if you're not into level grinding then you may want to give this a miss as the enemy have main spawn points which they don't go out of and not long after killing all the enemy they will spawn back again.
The a.i's are not as intelligent as those used in say killzone or halo (throw a grenade at an elite he will try and commando roll out of the way not stand there like a moron)all in all they enemy are not fun to fight but pretty boring. The only interesting action comes from multiplayer but with that many better multiplayers' out there and more coming out again you'd better spend your money elsewhere.

Levels
As I mentioned the levels have nothing to explore in them if you're expecting something like skyrim or fallout 3 with a living world populated by interesting events, locations and npc's prepare to be shocked.
Take earth for instance you will have to keep going back to the same location for all of the missions so in real terms destiny is actually very small but this is the same for the other locations off planet.

Conclusion
At first glance it really seem's good but after a few hours play and then a few more you realize there is not actually a lot there in terms of story characters or action.
Don't get me wrong I love bungie but I just don't know where it went all wrong.(although from what I understand some of bungie went to 343 industries to look after halo maybe that's where all the talent went)

If you want something like this but better play borderlands or Dead Island a lot more fun and you can play it offline.

If you're really desperate wait until it's in the bargain bucket then you won't be so wounded by the money you have just wasted."
118299,1,"I bought one of these three weeks ago.  Keep note I did not install Saitek's drivers; satisfied that Windows' and Linux's built-in drivers would suffice, as the backlit nature of the keyboard makes typing in the dark easier...

Eventually the ""n"" and ""m"" keys lost sensitivity, and I had to hit the bloody things hard to get the OS (Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit or Ubuntu Linux 8.10 64-bit) to recognize tje keystrokes.  ""n"" was far worse.

So, fair enough.  I exchanged it for a second one.  Unfortunately, after two HOURS of use, I've already had TWO occasions where the ""h"", quote, and right shift key stopped responding -- but started to work again after several minutes of... doing nothing.  How did I test this?  When seeing the ""h"" key wasn't doing squat, I held the key down.  There was a stammering delay between the ""hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""'s.  Sometimes by a factor of seconds.  Adjacent keys ""j"" and ""l"" worked perfectly despite the hang-up with the ""h"".  The most pathetic part is, this new problem didn't happen with the original keyboard.

Having read other reviews, it sounds like the sticking problem AND the non-responsive problems are quite common.  And these people have system specs ranging from older Pentium 4's to the newest i7s.  (Mine is an Intel Q9650 system with 8GB of RAM, running 64-bit Vista and Linux.)

Do not waste your money.

It isn't worth 80 cents."
222322,1,"Horn-mad!  For the longest time I couldn't get this game to run -- and couldn't get my money back.

Unbelievably, it insists that you have a constant internet connection the entire time you're playing it . . . even on single-player mode.  If the connection is lost, THE GAME WILL STOP -- even if you're in mid-battle!  I couldn't effin' believe it!  This is a game only for those who have super-stable high-speed internet connections.

But here was my real problem:  although I have a high-speed internet connection, it's through a proxy.  This is a common situation for people connecting in businesses, apartment complexes, government buildings, etc.

INCREDIBLY, the game does not have proxy support!  Or, at least, not all of it does:  TIBERIAN TWILIGHT will take your proxy settings from your default browser to update and register the game, but once it starts, THAT PART -- at least as of my writing -- has not been coded to route through the proxy.  It's possible this will be fixed with a patch in the future, but in the meantime what this means is that before you can get to the menu, it'll say ""unexpectedly disconnected from the internet.""  That's misleading:  what it really should say is that the part of the game that checks for the constant internet connection can only detect a direct connection.

If you have this problem and are bent on playing this game, what you need to do is get a program (""Proxifier"" is one example) that forces applications to recognize the proxy and connect through it.  Using this program, I was able to get TIBERIAN TWILIGHT as well as RED ALERT (another EA outing with a very similar problem) working.

But I have to say:  those programmers at EA are a boatload of 'tards for not coding proxy support into their games!"
271213,1,"To sell this game and make permanently captive any player (after payment of a 60-80 dollar fee) is unconscionable. The game can only be played while you tie up your modem continuously during play -- to their server. And the game itself is a joke. I have been playing SimCity from its first version many years ago and have never seen a version so blatanly fraudulent as this new SimCity Limited Edition.

If you do not like this abomination (and I am sure you agree) make sure you get your money back. I have returned my copy to Amazon and so far, have not had any problem with getting a credit. To protect their customers, I urge Amazon to immediately stop the selling of this version of SimCity. On the other hand, the older SimCity 4 is a very good game and keeps most players involved far beyond their expectations.

This ""game"" should be called ""EA MoneyCity"" because its only value seems to be the not-so-well-disguised effort by the publisher EA to separate us from our hard earned dollars in a number of sly ways.

25828,1,"I've been a big fan of most of EA Sport's titles throughout the years and this one is a huge disappointment. I love their new NHL hockey and the NCAA football, but his game's quality is questionable at best. In last year's version the had great graphics and good gameplay . . . but only half the cars on the track; a concern for some. I thought it to be entertaining. This year, at the expense of gameplay and graphics, they have a full pack of cars. But the end result is terrible. Inacurate handling of the cars and chippy (at best) game rate where the grandstands click by as if is was a PS one game. I owned it for two days trying to find some worth in it but, alas, could find no redeeming qualities in it and I sold it to someone who has a PS2 but no TV . . . the best way to enjoy it if you want to own it."
74129,1,"I'm very disappointed with this wireless adapter.  I purchased this 6 months ago for my son's Xbox 360.  He has been complaining for at least 3 months about being kicked off live or just a poor connection.  Now it has completely quit working.  Thankfully I saved the old cord he had used previously to connect.  Its a shame this cannot not be returned, its a complete waste of money."
298959,1,"Let me first say that I loved the NBA2k Series. I think NBA2k12 is one of the best sports games ever made. That's why it's so frustrating to play this game. When I first got the game, I put it in expecting to get a quick game or two in.... however, 2k had other ideas as it took almost 45 minutes to install. By that time, I had switched to the 360 while it installed.

A few days later, I finally got around to playing the game. I started with GM mode only to find features that were present in previous games were now taken away. I couldn't force trades if the computer was being ridiculous. Also, I set it up for a 21 game season with injuries off only to find I was set up with an 82 game season and Russell Westbrook got injured in the first week of playing. Awesome.

Now, fast forward to today. I want to play my franchise, but I can't connect to the 2k servers (my internet is working fine because I'm able to stream mlb.tv) so I'm stuck with a game I can't play.

I'm giving it two stars because it's fun when it works, but I can't begin to express how disappointing this game is and how far 2K Sports has fallen. I would not advise anyone to buy this game and instead wait until next year or buy on another system, because this game is a complete waste on the XBox One.

Update: 4/29. 2K servers are down again so I'm left with a game I paid full price that I can't play. I'm forced to take my review down to 1 star because this happens at least once or twice a week. Please Please Please do not buy this game. It's a lemon."
490753,1,"Over 100 hours of gameplay (5% completeion, LOL!) and I'm STILL barley learning how to use the mega-bloated, super-complex controls. I've been stumbling through mission after mission (they're all virtually identical) and it's becoming clear, it's just the same stuff repeated over and over and over again. Sadly, it has become so repetive and pointless, I just don't care to play it anymore.

Get dropped a mile away from the enemy base and go in and rescue or excute someone... rinse and repeat. That's it -- really. Oh yea; build up your base for no reason, whatsoever. Almost forgot that part (for some reason). Wait, maybe it's because the only room I can enter on my giant ""megabase"" is the toilet! I'M NOT JOKING!!! LOL!

The ""plot"" (LOL) is so disjointed and out of touch with reality, it couldn't suspend the disbelief of a 7 year old. The ""story"" (I don't even feel comfortable calling it that) really ads nothing to the MG saga, and is just yet another useless ad on. There is a pointless cut scene for EVERYTHING and the credits role whenever you complete the simplest mission. And no, you uselly can't skip it so you have to watch them over and over and over... and over....

Phantom Pain (in the A$$) really is just a demo with every useless gimick imaginable piled onto it. As far as ""online mode"", yea you guessed it... crickets. It's totally abandoned (from what I hear, it never did work... at all).

With all of the hype this title has received, I though it would at least be ""good"". It's not even average. There is NO WAY ON EARTH this game got a 4.5/5 from ANYBODY who actually played it and gave it a fair review. I even know half a dozen MG fanboys who either hate it or just didn't care for it. I don't know anyone who loved it or even thought it was a worthy entry on any level. Why would such a ""great"" game already be given away for FREE on PS+? Most all of the raving reviews for this one are TOTALLY FAKE. When you see the production cost for titles like this (millions alone are spent for advertisment and ""hype"" aka fake rewiews), it's pretty clear they have a team of monkeys sending out a lot of false praise for garbage games like this.

So if you like spending your time learning how to use a controler just in time to be bored out of your mind for a game that has a useless plot and ads nada to the franchise; THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! If not, skip it and play something else... pretty much ANYTHING else."
361990,1,Bought one pair and they made the controller feel so much better that I bought another pair for my second controller. Not even 3 months have passed and they are developing a horrendous stink. I had to remove them both yesterday. These are definitely not a long term solution for a better grip on your controller. I would not recommend them. The foam material absorbs sweat.

145754,1,"Back in 2008, I had a choice of the XBOX 360 or the PS3. Being a big Playstation fan, among other reasons, I chose the PS3.  Now, 4 years and 8 1/2 months later, the PS3 has died!  Sony has been on the decline with their games and their systems lately.  I have not played my PS3 much anymore due to the lack of games.  Instead, I used it for Blu Ray, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant Video.  So, even when the game selections stopped barreling through and Playstation Network got hacked, I still had good use for the system.  Now, I have a brick.  Thank God I bought an XBOX in 2011 and I have been much more satisfied with XBOX Live and the games.  PC games are still quite superior to any console, but still too slow to depend on for constant play.  On top of the system dying, anything I had from the Playstation Store/Network is now gone and unaccessible.  This is a huge downside to using consoles to purchase digital only content.  I guess you just roll the dice, play the game as quick as you can to reach the end and hope you can go back later to play.  At this time, I will not replace my PS3 and I have no plans to get the new console from Sony after they announce and release it.  I will have to see if Microsoft's hardware can deliver better than Sony.  If not, then I guess there is no hope for consoles lasting long anymore.  I sure feel that $400.00 for a system would have given more than 5 years of service."

417216,1,"wow this game is bad. I have yet to find a single thing i like in it. So much potential wasted. The PC version looks absolutely horrible and still can barely run at 60fps. Shadows look like crap. Reflections even worse. The weather transitions are horrible. The time changes are bad. Driving is the worst our of any game I have ever seen. I mean wow... what a let down. This should not even be mafia related. The missions are boring and all too similar. The controls are not well thought out. The list just goes on and on... I have not been a fan of 2k games in a long time, especially after the way they ruined NBA games, and now they ruined mafia. Save your money, even if you are on a console, this game is terrible."

110652,1,"I have played MMORPG games (EQ1, EQ2, WOW, Vanguard, COH) for years and was actually enjoying AOG until I hit nude NPC characters.
Pros: Fun but somewhat repetitive game play

Cons:
No chat filters
Cut movies or interactions with NPC had a lot of swearing
Nudity of NPC

I overlooked the cussing (both NPC and players), crass building names and how the game allowed every idoit to create characters with vile names but I couldn't continue to play the game once I hit the nudity. Shame on the makes for not giving me the option to filter it out. I turned off OOC chat to limit my exposure to morons, but the NPC language couldn't be filtered out.
 Yes it is a M17 game, but the developers need to give me the right to choose what I want to see/hear and what I don't. I am over 30 years old and have no desire to see topless women in a video game. If they want my money, they need to give me the tools I need to have an enjoyable experience. Instead, I am leaving this game with a foul taste in my mouth. I hope my friends will follow but even if they don't, I have to make a stand for my morals somewhere.
Save your money and look for a better game elsewhere. This game is trash."
73416,1,"This game has a good concept, nice graphics, and some definitely funny moments, but the gameplay is a total bore.

There are two main gameplay styles: ""investigation"" and ""trial"". Investigation is the worst; it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room, talking to everyone, and a ton of pointless reading, much like an old point-and-click adventure on PC.

The court sections are a little better, but not much. Once again, it's very linear; you don't have to use your brain much, just try all the options. And once again, there is a huge amount of reading. There is way too much dialogue packed into the game, and not near enough actual gameplay. And most of the talking is aimless, too; very little of it actually advances the plot.

Overall, this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters, and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text."
60704,1,"I had heard great things about this series and how scary they were, and what a great storyline the Silent Hill series has.  Unfortunately I will never know because I uninstalled it after about 5 hours of ""gameplay.""

I have been playing computer games for 25 years of all types, from Zork, to King's Quest, to FPS games, and without a doubt, this game has the worst movement controls and combat system I've ever seen.  It is incredibly awkward to move, mainly because of the camera angles, which continually change direction. Sometimes the camera will be in front of you facing the character (almost always a terrible position if combat is involved), and sometimes it will switch to a bird's eye view and you wil be staring at the character's head.  Combat is awkward too due to the camera angles.  It's difficult to target certain monsters, and some you won't even know are there until they're right on top of you when the camera is faced forwards.  This just not make for a ""Scary"" gameplay experience, just frustrating.  I hate dying to what appears to be a very easy monster because the camera angle won't easily shift to it.  When the camera is in first person view, response time of the mouse is not very quick (you can't change this, even with your mouse), and trying to use the ""look"" cursor to view objects takes way too long.

In addition to this, the game is slow.  You can run, but combat moves are about half as slow as traditional games (even adventure ones).  And if you die, prepare to have to go through a lot of trouble to get back to your resume point, including having to go through the same cinematic sequences, since the game has very inopportune save points.

I won't be going back to the Silent Hill series without playing a demo of future games first.  This game almost would have been much better as an adventure game instead of an action game.  I'd rather watch the cinematic sequences and try to figure out puzzles than spend my entire time just trying to move around and fight."
307481,1,"Boo EA. After their train wreck of a launch of Simcity, they have the nerve to charge 10 bucks... for an amusement park...

I would feel less robbed if they would have used a gun and a mask. It's rare to feel this ripped off about a video game purchase, but that EA managed to instill.

186264,1,"I've had nothing but problems with this upgrade when combined with the Nunchuk.  I'm at a loss here....  The games in the Sports Resort look like they could be fun, if only we could play them.

I have four controllers, and four motion plus add-ons, and three nunchuks.  (Obviously this limits us to three people for games that require the Nunchuk, which is fine.)  The problem is that only one of my Nunchuks works with the Motion Plus.  The other two work okay without the Motion Plus, and the Motion Pluses all work okay without the Nunchuks.  Combine them though, and only one works.  No good at all for three kids.  I've tried moving around the Motion Plus and Nunchuks, and it's very consistent.  The only Nunchuk that works correctly with the MotionPlus is the one that came with the game unit."

473868,1,"This is a TERRIBLE game.  The controls are clunky at best.  The graphics are poor.  And worst of all items just spontaneously disappear from where you've set them -- and in many instances, you have to set them in the places  from which they disappear.  For instance, you may have to place a propane bottle next to an object and blow it up.  Take a few steps away, turn around, the bottle is gone.  Unless you love self torture, do not waste your time or money on this piece of trash."

Way too much time devoted to linear tutorial, not enough variety or ""fun."" I loved AC1&2, but this one brings over nothing that made those games great. Very disappointing. I would say spending more time polishing would be a step up, but the gameplay, story, and overall feel of this game is such a drag that the added polish would be only a marginal improvement. Too bad."

My problem is not unique, there are tons of other people out there who have the same problem... and so far there isn't a solution :("

169201,1,Dogs*** on the PC - i should have never bothered.
122651,1,"I always loved the orginal Zoo tycoon on the computer. So when I saw Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS, I picked up a copy thinking I could have the same amount of fun, only portable. I was wrong. The game is nothing like the original. It's much simpler, and you can't really build impressive zoos. In the orginal game, you hire workers to care for the animals. You can still do that in the DS game, but I still found myself trying to care for the animals. And by care, I mean play annoying little minigames. You're options are severly limited in this version. You can't  build large, good looking areas for guests to sit and eat. There's only a couple buildings you can build, and even with research, there's not that much to build. And it's not even worth it to make buildings anyway. In the orginal Zoo tycoon, it was easy to make several buildings, and they would all generate a lot of profits. In this game, no one even bothers. THe upkeep is almost always more than the money earned. So it's a loss. My finalm complaint is the size. You're only allowed 30 animals, and there's very little space. I filled up over half my zoo with 5 exhibits.

This game seemed to have so much potential. The first Tycoon games were great. But, you can do a lot more in that game, even though it was made several years ago. Even the graphics in the sequel didn't come close to the original. This version was so downgraded, it lost what made the game fun.

If you remember the older games and loved them, keep playing those, this game just can't compare."
417200,1,"I am not a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto, but I like it and this game feels like a pale impression of that series. Saints Row worked for the simple fact it didn't take itself seriously and was about fun. So it had a certain charm about it and felt completely different than the Grand Theft Auto series. Mafia 3 I really wanted to love but in the end it feels like Wal-Mart brand Grand Theft Auto because it takes itself too seriously and the execution of the graphics, gameplay and mission don't match. Not to mention the bugs. Consoles have issues sure, but on PC the game crashes wildly and is unplayable at times.

The story itself is good if you can make it past the forgettable and boring gameplay. Not to mention the bugs and crashes depending on which version you own. This game had a great idea behind it, and if it had been crafted by another studio perhaps something really special here but it is a swing and a miss for Take 2 Interactive.

Imagine going to George R.R. Martin and him saying, ""I want a fan fiction author to finish my series, who can't afford professional editing."" That is the experience we get with Mafia III, a great concept for a story trapped behind a lack of professionalism, and execution. I thought about giving this game 3 stars on console but for PC the game doesn't even run. A future fix doesn't change the fact people who paid for the game got one that didn't even work at times.

Pros
- Story if you can make it through the host of technical issues (on PC you pretty much can't)
- Soundtrack

Cons
- Graphics
- Performance
- Bugs
- Boring mission system
- Bad execution
- wasted potential.

Grade: F for PC

Mafia 3 had potential to be a sleeper hit of the year, but Take 2 Interactive forgot to handle the technical elements and implement interesting gameplay and missions. I guess wait for a steam sale in the future, if you can get it for under 10 bucks could be worth it if they fix the issues with the game."
98458,1,"Don't get me wrong, BioShock is an amazing game, I absolutely love it, but it installs SecuROM on your computer which is NOT a good thing and it limits the amount of times you can install the game until it's a paperweight. I was very disappointed to disover that BioShock installed SecuROM on my PC, if you have an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 buy it for one of those... but not PC.
BioShock is a deep and rich game that will keep you immersed in its strange underwater fantasy world for hours at a time. You never know what is going to happen next and strange noises lurk around every corner of the city of Rapture. If you are looking for a thrilling first person shooter to occupy a bit of your time this would be the game to buy. 9/10."

This is one of the worst games I've ever played.  This is not fun"
162180,1,"I played this game for close to 200 hours in a failed attempt to get some fun out of it.  Yes, you're going to think that I got 200 hours of enjoyment out of it, but no I didn't.  I kept reading that if I get to X section or X level or X difficulty or X gear that the game comes alive.  700 days played in World of Warcraft.  Thousands of hours played in D2.  Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit.

I believed in Blizzard Entertainment.  I really, really did.  From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.  Then you're expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story.  Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class, thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot.  Sounds pretty stupid right?  It is trust me.  What if the other guy in the group doesn't want to share?  You get nothing.  Fun huh?  So at this point you're stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money.  This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level.  Pure fail Blizzard!  Pure fail!

Then there are issues with the game's difficulty as it makes you play the game out on beyond easy mode where I lost 3 friends to boredom.  They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire, intentionally got hit, and never died.  They said the game was crap and quit.  The game doesn't get decent until the 3rd time you've played it through.  So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die.  If you get to a section you can't get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you're back to god mode again.

Last point I want to touch on is that the game's end game is nonexistent.  As in it's hard not because it's fun, but because it cheeses you into death.  I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear.  Then you can last for 3 hits!  So assume you're not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house.  So you're going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs.  You might die 9 times to a mob if you're not spending real money on gear.  Repair bill will be close to 50,000 gold.  The mob will drop about 3,000 gold in items and money.  So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person.  But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over.  Sounds like fun huh?  Who thought mechanics that can one shot kill you were fun?

I also want to mention that the game lags like no other.  Take the one shot mechanics from the aforementioned paragraph and sprinkle in some huge lag spikes and you can watch your characters die over and over to invisible mobs, invisible attacks, melee mobs hitting you clean across your screen, etc.  And there is a Hardcore mode where if you die you lose your character and all of it's gear.  That makes the game even more fun with lag!

Game is terrible.  Leave it in the store.  Do not buy.  It is not fun in the slightest when you get to Inferno.  The story is terrible.  The gear drops don't exist for you.  The auction house is the best place to level up.  And the real money auction house has the best gear.

Enough said.  :)"

Extreme disappointment since the first three installments were outstanding and now I have to deal with a game I purchased that won't play.

Right now the game goes for $5 and it's in the 2011 bestseller list where I can apply one of the $5 discounts I got for buying games in the winter holiday sale, so, I could effectively get this game for free but I won't because of the DRM.

Appeal to publishers: please find alternatives to limiting the number of installs and if you can't then at least provide an official patch that removes the DRM a month or two after the release (like Witcher2 did), after all, you mostly care about the first weeks sales to not be a victim of piracy. It is completely unacceptable to have one or more year old games that still enforce this kind of DRM. Thank you!"

Even after you install it (Windows 7 system) and let it spend an hour and a half downloading all the fixes, the game is so buggy it's frustrating as heck to play.  DON'T apply the second CD/DVD thinking that will help -- I ended up in an area that I literally could not get out of.  I uninstalled and started all over *again* with just the NWN2 portion of the game.  Gameplay itself would be good, if it worked consistently.  The storyline is ok; I could do without the cut scenes.  You can cut some of them short by clicking the mouse, but you run into the risk of inadvertently hitting a choice on a multiple choice menu that you didn't realize was coming up.  Sometimes the characters won't follow the leader.  Sometimes the characters won't attack even when you tell them to.  I'm just finding it incredibly poorly implemented.  (There's one character I ""save"" only to find him again needing to be saved -- and he doesn't remember our earlier encounter.)  I have no idea what further issues are in store for me.  I really cannot recommend this purchase unless you're willing to fight the gameplay as well as the creatures in the game itself."

223883,1,"If you were unsure if the acquisition of bioware by EA would affect the quality of game they put out, here's your answer. I have played bioware games since KOTOR and have yet to see them put out a such a steaming, bug filled pile as this. If you told me that the extent of their testing this game was one quick play through by some random junkie, who had never played an RPG, and was stoned out of his mind the whole time, I'd believe you. There is a glitch where the player character's attack speed gets progressively slower and slower. Thus turning fast paced button slapping action into an unbearably dull and exceedingly frustrating affair. I hear that this glitch is made worse by being a mage, which I was. I had to replay hours of the game to undo the slowdown only for it crop back up over and over until I gave in. My friend who has this game as well was a mage and was unable to avoid the glitch. He ended up selling the game without finishing it. It is said that you can slow down so much that your character will no longer attack at all. *<*< THIS GLITCH IS CONFIRMED ON ALL PLATFORMS! IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY TO UPDATE THE GAME VIA BROADBAND INTERNET, I WOULDN'T BOTHER BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE GETTING 20 HOURS INTO A GAME ONLY TO HAVE IT RUINED BY A GLITCH. EVEN IF YOU DO I'D WAIT TILL THEY PUT OUT A PATCH<*<*  You can read more on the details of this else where on the Internet. Also there is a vertical stretch on the sprites during the cut-scenes that flickers on and off randomly. Once more the kind of thing that testing easily reveal. There's a lot of other glitches I won't get into. All the major review sites don't seem to mention the game breaking slow glitch but, hell screw the hand that feeds you, just take there $60 and give them a turd. I could talk about the lack of central plot or the fact that you can just barely read the text without an HDTV(20/20 vision, with 46"" TV) or the obscured fashion side quests are presented (how fun to go into the start menu over and over) but, their obvious lack of adequate testing is obtusely more present in my experience of this game. Thanks for a game that left me pissed off enough to waste more time writing this review."

489786,1,Who the f*** would buy this xbox one for a high price. Whoever selling this is a total rip off
29832,1,"This game stinks on all 3 systems (4 if you count GBA). There is more jumping around than fighting. And the fighting is just punching. So the whole game is jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, punch, punch, punch, jump, jump, etc. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
374581,1,"Let me get the positives out of the way first. It's small, doesn't require an outlet to charge like most other chargers, can charge two at one time, has a light on the front to indicate it's charging, and is totally wireless. The two chargers on the back are also a huge plus.
There's really only one big negative, and it has to be that I always feel like it's going to break. It feels cheaply made, its constantly getting knocked off center by my cats, me, my dogs tails, anything. I feel like the USB ports are going to snap off inside. It just feels flimsy. I can't complain too much as I only paid about $7, but iafter only a few hours of using it, all I can think about is how the USB ports are going to break. The charging ports aren't very deep either and something is constantly bumping my controller off the charging station. My cats like to lay near/on top of my PlayStation because it's so warm so that's why they're always hitting it.
If you have an entertainment center and your PS4 is behind a door or you don't have animals, I'd totally recommend it, otherwise I'd pass.

Edited to change rating from 3 stars to 1: after not even two days, the USB port broke off in my PS4. I tried to unplug it since I wasn't using it and the left USB plug(if you're looking at the PlayStation) was still plugged in. Horribly cheap and I'll be buying a different charger"
303673,1,"A dusty, dirty controller shoved haphazardly and unsecured into an opened retail box (upsode down AND backwards) cobered in dust and dirt. On top of that, increibly slow shipping and handling. Shell out the extra $5 and get yourself a brand new unit. This one arrived in one piece but that's about all there is to say for it. Absolutely will not buy again."
137833,1,"I didn't do my homework and forgot to check for DRM before buying this game. Man was that a dumb move. I've now been sitting here for 2 hours trying to log in to steam and then installing the game. Even with the disk in the drive, I think steam is trying to download all of the install files. To be honest, it would have been faster to download a pirated copy of this game than to wait for steam to do its slow dance of torture.

I'd like to say I'll never buy another steam game again, but instead I'll just be more diligent and check for pirate releases before I waste time with steam again."
24875,1,"Basically... This game sucks. The graphics suck, the dialog is boring, this title is overrated. I sold my copy to some idiot on eBay and I get a negative review because it sucks so bad. I rather play with a barbi than play this POS."
6930,1,"I like adventure games, but I like them to follow some sort of logical  puzzle solving, so dyou can kind of get inside the mind of the creators,  figure out how they think and figure the game out that way. These puzzles  are completely illogical, obviously designed to be frustrating, and keep  you trying different senseless things to proceed in the game.  Also,  although the 2D backgrounds were interesting at times, calling this a 3d  game is quite a stretch by any definition. Even the 3d cut-scenes were  crappy, and the graphics during regular gameplay were just terrible.  Supposedly the game made ""game of the year"" in Europe, they must  be pretty hard up over there, now I know not to take that as a  commendation."
336908,1,I wish you could give a negative star. The USB chargers are the wrong size for the PS4. They are positioned in the wrong place as well. Simply horrible
308394,1,"This game runs at 720p on xbox one, what a joke right? But don't worry, The ps4 Runs at 1080p so you are safe :D

Thank me later"
461005,1,"This does not work, I tried for hours to get this to work and it would not work. My computer would detect it but it would never calibrate and the controls would just flutter and fluctuate. Waste of time and money!"
75941,1,"The game loaded well, needed to re-boot , no big deal, BUT it has a program protector , that destroys your computers drivers.
So I did not complete the download process.
Had I know about the game protection system, I would not have purchased the game."
267927,1,"Do not purchase this it is complete crap. I want to be nice; wait, no I don't. This does't serve it's purpose at all. IT is complete trash. After using it for a few days over 4 hrs of use per day it becomes malleable and starts to fail miserably. Just go purchase the Zowie alternative and forget this piece of crap."
176738,1,"I am no super smart person, but I bought the Rockband drums for my family for Christmas, and I bought the Cymbals to go with the drum set. Nothing states that the Cymbals will not work with the Wii Rockband drum set. After getting up Christmas morning and everyone happy and working together to get the drum set working they could not get the cymbals to work after digging through the instructions I found that the cymbals would only work with the Rockband 2. We did not know that there is a rockband, rockband 2 and now a rockband 3. For those of us that are not real gamers this was discussing."
431794,1,"Bought mine in May 2017 and it is ""double clicking"" on single click after 5 months :( Unfortunately I have to deal with Corsair support for this since it has been discovered that this is a hardware issues due to the Omoron switches in the mouse itself. It's not a software bug sadly, they can't patch it out.

Sad, I really loved this mouse too. It was easily my favorite."
433451,1,Riptide  is worst worst zombi game of alltime. It's a joke.
304029,1,"If I wanted to play games at 720P I would stick with a PS3 or 360.

If you want graphics in stunning 1080P, buy a PS4. Over 2.1 million already have!

Merry Christmas everyone!"
136097,1,"I thought The Sims was a cool concept at first, then i realized what a time consuming bunch of nonsense it is. Creating people and having a bit of fun for an hour or so to me is fine, but people are obsessed and sit in front of the computer playing this stupid game for hour upon hour, ignoring there families, friends and even WORK. ITS A GAME. make your real life, not a virtual one. I have nothing against thee game personally if you wanna play and have some fun for a little while, even small bits at a time. I played SIMS 2 and started to get a bit hooked so i said you know what this is worse than any drug, so i gave it up. Plus i just thing the whole thing is pretty lame. Word to the wise, game a bit, live a lot. Or get a life."
48815,1,"Blah! I was looking for more free-to-roam games on the wiki and this game was on the list and when I read about it, it sounded fun so I brought it for Xmas only to be greatly disappointed.

What bothered me the most was that you HAD to do the missions and you HAD to drive a certain car. The game designers for this game were so up tight! He couldn't get into a car because of the lock, couldn't start the car after tearing the door down because again he never seen the lock before. Which makes no sense. If you are going to kick someone out of their car, they aren't taking heir keys with them!

Ugh! So I did the driving options. The countryside or city one and I loved the countryside because the graphics were nice but god forbid you mess that car up because he can't jack another one! Ugh! I'm starting to wonder why I got so bored with GTA San Anadreas."
380639,1,"this isn't a lara core design had originally created and has zero of the things old school lara croft had and things that we used to care about all the original enemies like natla and her mentor Werner Von Croy are no longer here also they took away all her tools and uniqueness such as back flips cartwheels somersault and catchphrases so don't expect to be see dinosaurs bats or anything out of the ordinary  that used to be in TR games anytime soon lol now she's nothing more than a ripoff female version of drake from uncharted just more wimpy and too emotional lara in this reboot is now basic and generic thanks to crystal dynamics thats now known as square enix they twist her origin story that was in tr chronicles and completely changed her weapons ,mentor, and her age when she first had her adventure in the original lara explore when she was 6 with von croy in a cave in this reboot her first adventure is in her teens so they sort of changed her bio i guess it's just to please and attract a newer fan base

story #spoiler this game is about lara and her friends just as the trailer shows she was searching for a artifact that in a island but got trap in a storm before they find out that it wasn't a normal storm its from a storm god and survivors that is trap in that island started to worship it bcuz they felt like that island is curse once the ship crashed and wrecked and landed on the island everyone blamed lara because they wouldn't be in this situation bcuz of her blah blah blah long story abunch of pointless characters thats friends with lara dies in the story plot they try to get connect for rescue that fails and the most annoying character name sam gets kidnapped so they can transfer the storm god into sam body lara stops it in time and killing some guy that they met after that landed into the island bcuz it tuns out he was one of the insane survivors that was trap in the island - the end
honestly this main story is dry and shouldn't even be a tomb raider game this should be concerned a spin off in my opinion bcuz lara seems completely useless the story aint all that interesting and it tries to focus on everyone else but since this was the start of the first ever multiplayer TR game its the only reason i got this game speaking of online multiplayer it really need work there isn't variety of weapons u have to get a certain rank to unlock a character and ur character dies way to fast there isn't any health meter so u can only guess how much damage u can take bow arrows is overpowered and there's no crosshairs while aiming it feels more like a cheap knockoff of uncharted instead of a actual tomb raider game in my opinion it feels like they took everything away that gave TOMB RAIDER AN IDENTITY if u an old school TR fan i don't recommend bcuz u will be disappointed with all these unnecessary changes, just like this unnecessary reboot"
416512,1,This game is a joke. You will be bored after the first hour trust me. The gameplay is derivative and the main character is one of the most boring characters I have ever played. There are also a lot of bugs and glitches. Seriously if you have to play it wait until used and on sale six months from now for ten bucks.
410067,1,"Started off with a 4.5/5 star rating as you can see from my updates at the very bottom. Final rating is a 2/5.

I am near the end of the game (in about 18 hours no less). What started off as a nice, refreshing experience that pays homage to one of my favorite game series of all time quickly turns into a boring game with copious amounts of backtracking and little to no content aside from the main story. This isn't a Star Ocean game, it is the hollowed out corpse of a Star Ocean game.

The story isn't nearly as bad as other people have made it out to be. However, there is also little depth to the story. Without getting into spoilers, let's just say that you don't really care about the characters. Some of the private moments make no sense because there is no backstory to give it context.

The battle system is fine. One of the only good parts of the game.

The bulletin board quests are a joke. You can only do the same fetch X item quests so many times before it becomes monotonous.

The cities and towns are nice but there is nothing in them. The cities of star ocean 2 were half the size (or smaller in some cases) and yet there were tons more homes to enter, chests to gather, people to speak to. There is none of that in this game. The world map is no different. there are so few areas that they are forced to make new chests appear after certain points in the game in order for there to be some reason to explore.

There is no side content. Aside from the bulletin board quests, there really isn't much to do. The game just feels boring. Maybe that is why they don't allow you to save at certain points of the game. That way you will die, have to back track 20 minutes worth of stuff just to get back to where you were (the battle with Der-Suul).

One of my favorite parts of Star Ocean games is private actions and getting secret/optional characters. To this point, aside from endings, I couldn't find a single reason to continue to do PA's. I also hate the fact that there are NO secret/optional characters.

I don't really have an issues that there are some monsters from previous games as well as some music. To me, I enjoy that stuff. It doesn't feel cheap or like a short cut, it is nostalgic. I loved hearing some of the SO3 music from Kirlsa & Aquaria in this game. What I do have a problem with is that the only thing elements do is remind me of the former glory that Star Ocean had as a video game. Even with the short story and very linear game, it would have been fine with a great deal of post-game content. Although I am close to finishing the game, according to everything I have read, there isn't much to do.

Pick it up for $30 or something later on.

Update ---

I am now about 7 hours into the game. Still liking the game but I am adding some more Pro's and Con's and dropping the rating to 4 stars.

Pro's:
I like how they used some music from SO3 and incorporated it into this game. I also like the cathedral challenge thing. Pretty neat concept. I do like that there are a lot of enemies from other star ocean games and that the enemies change as you progress through the game. Story is good to this point (not great but good). I like the idea of harvesting/mining/fishing.

Con's: They have these big, beautiful cities and yet there is nothing to do in them. Private actions are minimal. In previous Star Ocean games you could enter almost every house in a given town/city to explore. The amount of treasure chests are minimal. I hate how battle skills aren't learned by levels but rather from miss able items.

So far it is still a good game and I would still recommend it to any Star Ocean fans. But I can't help but feel like they missed an opportunity to add more depth to this game. Also, as some people haven't been aware of this, if you are having camera issues you can zoom in and out using the d-pad.

-----

About 3 1/2 hours in and so far... I would give it 4.5 stars. Definitely feels like a Star Ocean game (which is great). It has many of the elements of a traditional JRPG. I loved Star Ocean 1, 2 and 3 but was not a fan of 4. The odd boss battles of 4 really turned me off (thankfully the boss battles in this game are more reminiscent of precious Star Ocean titles). As someone that has beaten Star Ocean 2 & 3 at least 5 times each, I am a big fan and 4 was just unplayable. I tried 4 different times to get into that game and I just couldn't. This game had me hooked almost instantly.

I really can't say much more other than I love the fact that the person that did the voice for Rena in the Star Ocean 2 PSP port also does the voice for a character in this game. So far the Item creation system seems good but I haven't progressed far enough to really test how complex and in depth it is.

I will continue to update this review as I get further. The one thing I am not a fan of is the in town environment. It isn't a huge deal but talking to NPCs can sometimes feel a bit awkward and clunky. Haven't had any issues with the camera as other people have but I can see why it would irritate some people.

Ignore the 1 star reviews that knock the story. Although I can't say for certain how it is, any 1 star review knocking the story can't be real as the game was just released today. How can you have seen any major plot twists or surprises when you haven't finished the game?"
290724,1,"We've had consistent issues with the PS4:  (1) Extremely slow downloads in even with our high-speed connection;  (2) Frequent reports of connection problems even though other WiFi devices in the same room work flawlessly; (3) we have to pay to play on servers that are free for the PC versions of the same games; and (4) PSN is notifying us that we must change our password when receive an email, and my grandson is unable to use his PS4 until we do (still waiting for the email)."
372664,1,No where near as good as 2012 or 2013.
231308,1,Broke in 5 days.
369639,1,"I have had multiple headsets for my PS3. They all worked fine, no problems. They all broke when I dropped my bag. My older brother really enjoys being able to talk over PSN and play games with me. So he spent $40 on this headset. It does not work, and when it does, it is annoying and unbearable to keep on.

I do not know where Sony's priorities are, but they are all over the place. Their PS3s are better bluray players than their bluray players, they make good systems, but not accessories. Next they are going to make a PS3-TV combo and forget to make remotes/controllers for it."
468176,1,A total waste of money. It does not work on my PC. Just ended up deleting it from my machine.
354996,1,26 Awards before the game is released. The modern gaming world is a pathetic cesspool of paid for reviews and hype. This game is an incomplete rip off and EA deserves it's worst company of the year award it earns every year.
327940,1,"Even kids wouldn't care for this game for more than an afternoon. I knew it would consist of Olaf collecting snowflakes. That wasn't hard to predict. But there is NO enemies! And NO point to the game! Collect crap if you want to (that does nothing) and just walk through level after boring level. It is at best, an incomplete turd of a game. It looks like it is an unfinished product. Put this garbage on the app store for free. Don't box it up and scam people who loved what was an awesome movie out of thirty bucks. GameMill couldn't program a VCR, much less a good game. Always pay attention to the publisher/developer names. GameMill? GameWho? Guaranteed crap game. Not to say bigger publishers don't put out crap too but this was an obvious dog turd game. Poor Olaf. He didn't deserve this."
477210,1,AOK
287120,1,Maybe EverythingDeals should reconsider their name when they're selling twenty dollars for twenty five dollars.
250589,1,"I was so excited to get this game I got it shortly before I received Supernatural. It installed just fine but when I get into the game it is slow and doesn't work well at all. The animals look like ghosts because there all see through, not to mention when I try to do anything with horses I mean anything the game crashes every single time. I play the newer Supernatural with out a single problem. I just don't get why EA fell so far from the bar with this one. All of the other Sims3 games play except for this one. Im SOOO frustrated that I have to go out and buy a gaming computer because of this. Its just crazy if you ask me so I give it a low rating because im not the only one that is having these issues."
57527,1,"This game is so bad, you can't even get started in it, the instruction manual has no information of any use, and the on screen help is nonexistent. Go for Reel Fishing 3 or earlier reel fishing games such as 2 and the original one if you want to enjoy a fishing game."
110891,1,"Just Cruise over to MetaCritic to see how low of a rating this game received from both critics and players alike.  Everything I loved about Cruis'n USA for N64 is completely gone to be replaced by terrible controls, terrible graphics, very long loading times, and a poor interface.

For some reason there are several good Amazon reviews (leading me to unfortunately buying this disaster), which you will see does not coincide at all with the plethora of negative reviews on MetaCritic.

Avoid at all costs.  Buy yourself Cruis'n USA on WiiWare instead."
185433,1,Too hard to drive a simple car! You have to follow the line and still some races are too hard! They give you a random car and you have to race it and you can`t modify it. It would have been a good idea to give you a simulation test or a training stage to run all the cars or the basics.
417238,1,"Horrible mouse, just stops working for 30 - 60 seconds randomly, worthless as a basic mouse, couldn't imagine trying to game with it.
Sent it back."
265670,1,"This game is standard Madden. It has the monopoly on the Football franchise in video games. I've been playing the Madden games through the years and each game continues to have the same problems. For instance, holding calls against your team that you have no control over are irritating. Also, Computer AI on your side is garbage. If I'm running the ball and I have a lead blocker, that lead blocker will run in front of me for a sec and then avoid blocking the defensive player 9 times out of 10.

Passing plays are the same, butter finger receivers even if they are Megatron or Fitzgerald. Almost every pass that is not directly on the mark is intercepted by the defense. The defense intercepts balls so easily that it's a wonder how such good hands wouldn't be on the offensive side of the ball. Interceptions are so frequent that I decided to run the ball only and only throw screen passes. Of course doing this makes it difficult to win, but at least it's not impossible. I could be playing Tom Brady from the Patriots vs the Oakland Raiders defense and they will have 5 interceptions! It's like the receivers are not interested in catching the ball and the defenders can catch a ball ten feet in the air even if they are linebacker.

Madden has always had problems with the levels of difficulty. Usually, the games are way too hard or way too easy, but at least they were still fun. The computer has such unfair advantages that it makes the game not even remotely enjoyable. With so many previous versions to use as a point of reference it's hard to believe that any game developer could mess it up. It seems like the developers took what worked on previous additions and removed them, and then doubled down on the irritating things that everyone hates. Why on earth would you rename Franchise Mode ""Connected Careers?"" Is it to automatically confuse everyone? I bet the vast majority of first time Madden 13 players spent at least an hour trying to find Franchise Mode.

It's hard to believe that with all the technilogical advances and all the previous games to references these developers managed to create the worst Madden of all time. I would rather play Madden 95 on Sega Genesis."
258551,1,"I had never thought I would see a game that was more grossly disappointing then ""Duke Nuke'em Forever"". Well one came out. And it had to be an even more iconic franchise, indeed it was the franchise that cemented the idea of what military science fiction should look and sound like. More horrible is the thought that ""Aliens"" is thee biggest influance of pass and current titles from other movies to book and video games; Doom, Halo, StarCraft even Dead Space all take inspiration from that second film.

Waking up on release day I first checked IGN to see what they had to say about Aliens: Colonial Marines. A rating of 4. Bad.  That was their official review.

But never the less IGN is known to have impossible high standards and most people seem to disagree with; plus one should never speak ill of any product without testing it yourself.

Oh Dear god IGN was Right. It's a horrible game.  This is why there is Gamefly.

Despite touting special sound effects from the movies, James Horner's music and voice talent by both Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen this game STILL fell several miles short. The graphics would be good if this was an Original Xbox game, there are next to no particle effects and the sound is muted. The music isn't as loud as it should be and seriously lacks that driving percussion that fallowed the latter half of the second Alien film, there is no satisfying ""thud"" as bullets smack into things or a meaty crunch as exoskeletons break apart like Dungeness crab legs, absolutely everything is half assed here, so much that the 2010 version of Aliens Vs Predator is massively superior game.

The plot is this, you rescue Hicks. That's really it in a nut shell, turns out Hicks wasn't in his cryo-chamber when the other ones where jettison because Wayland Yutani PMC had boarded the ship and took him hostage. You go find him, disrupt Wayland operations, kill a lot of Xenos and PMCs, that's it."
283371,1,very bad
178021,1,"First, I'd like to say that I do like a lot of role playing games. Skies of arcadia, Fable series, Mass Effect series, and more are quite excellent.  I feel that this game certainly is not.  This is of course my OPINION.  I cannot stand people who who call other people's reviews stupid or idiotic for expressing their opinion.  I am now expressing mine.
I picked this game up for $7 plus change at target on clearance a few months ago.  Never before have I felt cheated when spending $7 on a game.  The graphics are good.  That's about it.  It has WAY too many cutscenes.  The combat is horrible.  Basically, I tried to play it twice for an hour or so and it was painful.  I wanted to like it but, just couldn't.
I do not understand the great reviews for it.  Then again, I don't know why people like reality TV shows either.....

My point:  Just because everyone else feels it's good doesn't mean that everyone will agree.  How this came from the same womb as Mass Effect is completely beyond me."
416296,1,Had the misfortune to see this latest foray into rewriting American history to the betterment of Africans everywhere.  Give me a break.
130304,1,"I play video games to have fun, not to be frustrated. I spent three hours playing this game, but that's the last three hours Resident Evil will ever get from me. You have to stand still to shoot?! You can only punch/kick/jump/etc. only when prompted? Camera angle sometimes changes by itself...especially when I need to face the enemies, not have my back toward them. Ammo is too limited for the number of enemies to kill. I have to use the knife a lot of the time, and you have to hold L2 all the time to have it equipped. Why can't you do just a one-time toggle like other games? My hands hurt playing this game for only three hours. Stupidly designed game. There are other cons, but my hands are too tired to type right now, from playing this very frustrating game. Good-bye, Resident Evil. I will spend my next $60 on another game, not Resident Evil 6."
244214,1,Never worked.
208934,1,"Rareware is dead to me! I hate this video game a lot! It's Jak 2 all over again! They change the theme, make it too much and too boring to do, and instead of questing throughout a land, we're stuck in a crappy city! None of the worlds are that interesting! ANd what does Banjo need to do? He has to race! No No No! That is not the theme of the Banjo-Kazooie franchise! What did Banjo- Kazooie or Tooie even have to do with building or driving vehicles? It didn't! This is coming out of nowhere! Also has anyone looked at the characters? They all  looked cuter and interesting in the first two games, but now they're just ugly looking! It's a disgrace!"
181089,1,"While I like the type of strategic battle - turn based mixed with grid based movement - i.e. SRPG; I could not get into this game. The feather element is inventive (strategic sacrifice of a party member in battle). The ""sin"" element is inventive, but feels flawed, for lack of a better term, and makes battles either too hard (usually) or too easy.
I have a feeling I picked the worst Valkyrie Profile game to start with.
Aside from that: The graphics look like 8 bit or worse!, the story felt REALLY boring to me, and the game, in general, is tedious. The 3rd battle you're in is a bit too difficult for the beginning of the game. I can look past that since eventually I progressed, but the game continued to be, as my title states, and forgive my redundancy, tedious and boring. A big let down for a Square Enix game. Perhaps I'll try my luck with a different V.P. game."
480470,1,"The game doesn't work, at the beginning it will not let me go upstairs even though I have done everything to get up their.  I ask friends and they have the same problem so I went on the web and tried what they said but no go so I got a bad game. That's 2 games I have gotten that doesn't work! !! So I will stick to Big Fish games I have never gotten a bad game from them!!!!!!"
151528,1,"This game has by far the worst physics of any game I've ever played. The control system is overly difficult to get used to and even when you do it isn't easy to play. The game is abnoxiously dark (as the game says in the title) so it's really hard to see anything, even with the brightness turned way up. Enemies in this game are more difficult than they should be and mercilessly pummel you even on the easiest setting. I got fed up with this game after 3 hours and tossed it in the bottom of my game basket with my old Atari and Nintendo games. Save your money and time and avoid this game like the plague."
280531,1,"I am a die hard fan of CoH, i waited a long time for this new sequel, i didn't know Sega would be involved in this game, they took the CoH title and crapped all over it, the game is nothing like the previous installment, its a shadow of what we are used to from CoH, also you won't be able to play the game, i couldn't even finish the first mission, it crashes and there are no efforts to fix these bugs and issues with the game, its a complete waste of money and i don't encourage anyone to buy this game."
37317,1,"Please save your money and do not buy this game. If you want a good LOTR game buy the two towers for any platform. First off I had problems with sound (I have sb live plat 5.1) so if it doesn't work well for sound blaster what does it work well for. The graphics are okay, but being as how the gameplay is LAME and the quests you get are lame.. do not buy this. They took a good story and went off in the wrong direction. I ended up returning this after giving it a decent chance (even with the sound problems)"
271189,1,I am very sad to see that the sim city franchise has come to an end I played this game as a boy and was going to pay 60$ for it easy but after finding out they no longer allow ownership I decided against it.

396711,1,"I played this game and it was a complete MESS , little by little i started hating it more and more . it was difficult to maneuver and just confusing . Do Not Buy This Game ."
145693,1,I would love to purchase this game but sadly I will not be doing so. This game could have been great but is tainted with the stink of DRM (SecuROM) enforced limited installs. The DRM is a part of the game that you can't avoid if you install it so I must focus my review on the DRM. Supposedly this game releases the authorization if you uninstall the game but what happens if there is a problem contacting the server at the time the uninstaller tries to do so? It probably won't release your install. What happens if your system crashes and you just format or you buy new hardware and forget to uninstall the game? Your authorization won't be released. Then you have to call them and hope that they believe you purchased the game in order to play once you run out of authorizations. If they don't believe you I don't know what the procedure is but you probably won't be playing anytime soon. It would just be another hoop that they want you the legitimate customer to jump through and hope it works. I would recommend that everyone stop purchasing games with these limitations. The only people hurt by these limitations are the legitimate customers. Pirates will have the games from day one regardless. The game itself has been getting good press which makes me sad because the limiting DRM that it is saddled with will keep me from getting it. Luckily these days there are many other games out there to be had that don't force this DRM on the end user so I will be looking elsewhere.

so you have to wear the same outfit that you started with . Also for some strange reason everytime i am behind someone
they shoot a turtle shell at me, animal abuse much? Also they don't tell you how to get good at the game, so whenever
you start you are going to get owned. OH and if your Wii u is dusty from not playing it in 1 year, you may want to blow
it off. Anyways i rate this game 1/5, for obvious reasons. But i recommend this game if you are a big fan. so 5/5 for big fans :D

215581,1,"Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.

You start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.

The graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.

I never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.  There is a couple of months for the developer to correct their mistakes before the second part of this game is released in July of 2011 but I'm not holding my breath."

355086,1,"You'd think that this being the first of the NHL franchise titles on a new generation of consoles would make EA want to step up their game and take advantage of this opportunity. There was a lot to like about the previous title NHL 14, and the game brought players closer than ever to a realistic gaming experience. With clever marketing video game publisher EA Sports cashes in on gamers who are anticipating a great new hockey title for their new console. They fool us because (and this hard to say) it is not a complete game! Have you ever played a game that felt unfinished, poorly made and rushed? NHL 15 is the definition of that.

The sad part is EA allows themselves to be lazy and release unfinished games because they don't have any competition. They make fancy commercials praising it's product taunting fans with ""new and improved additions"" making the envy of gamers everywhere. The only thing NHL 15 has to it's credit is improved graphics (splendid on the PS4) and that's only due to the new consoles, that would be giving EA too much credit.

I, like many others just wanted a fun NHL game for my new console. As a big fan of hockey, l had september 9 marked on my calendar. Where's Living the Life mode? It showed potential in '14, but is not here. The menus are frustrating and bad just like the new referee system where the refs mostly get in your way. Where are create modes? 3 stars of the game? GM Mode feels rushed. There's so many things that aren't there, it's mind boggling. Online play? Essentially useless. That's basically it (other reviewers have done a great job at outlining all that is wrong/missing so l won't get too much into it). But hey we get new commentators right? Ugh.

Be patient for updates? How about release a game that's complete. If it isn't don't, delay it, making the customers angry is not smart. Waste of 60$.It doesn't make me happy to write this review. I rarely ever give one star rating but EA you should be ashamed and l feel ripped off. I'll surely be trading this in or getting my money back. Do not fall for the ""hype"". Be wiser. I'd give it negative ten if l could. Essentially useless and a cash grab. I'm not sure l'll ever buy an EA title again at this point. Keep your NHL 14s for the time being, you'll be happy you did."
354479,1,"The gameplay had me 1 yawn away from falling asleep. The cell shaded graphics are no match for the graphic capabilities of the PS4, and will leaving regretting not buying this game cheaper for the ps3.

There are times this controller will just stop with nothing but the blue button going and the most minimal use. It doesn't respond well connected to Windows 10.

55079,1,"Sierra brought us many wonderful titles over the years, including the Kings Quest, Hero's Quest, Police Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry serials.  In most cases, they did a good job putting together creative, cute, situation driven puzzle games.  Here, they delivered an appalling blend of poor graphics, bad language, and simplistic game play.

Gone are interaction with characters, puzzles, and good writing.  Instead, one plays simple 2-D mini-games and views poorly developed cut-scenes.

The game is a bizarre blend of exceptionally childish ""humor,"" such as fart jokes and random acts of not-very-clever profanity, coupled with 4 or 5 mini-games so shoddy and simplistic they recall the days of CGA.  Too simple for those over 10, too profane for those under 16, this game would not be worth playing if it were free.  At $50, Sierra sells their reputation and little else.  I will think twice, and read some reviews, before purchasing another Sierra product."
304801,1,"I'm so irritated with this product that even after years of it sitting in my purchased list I feel the need to give it a negative review. I vowed never to give EA or Maxis another penny, and I have stayed true to that resolution after purchasing this game. Since this game has been released they have made no improvements to the core elements of the game that where flawed by design. This game is not a city builder. They realized they had a problem with their agent system's efficiency, so they did everything in their power to minimize the amount of space the player had to generate agents. Buildings that are core to your city are massive. With the limited amount of space you cannot build a metropolis, or anything close to what you could in previous versions of the game.

If you want a city builder pick up the game that took everything Maxis failed to execute and did it majestically, Cities: Skylines."

445827,1,"This game is complete crap. The graphics look decent,but the gameplay is for sh**.I can't even begin to tell you how bad ""Batman & Robin"" is. First off,the controls are terrible. You have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to fight,drive the batmobile,swim,use the gadgets...it's even a pain to try and walk. The map of Gotham is very small and all of the buildings of the area look the same. The game is also almost impossible. You get one life. After you die,it's game over,and right back to the beginning. You can also die quickly as well. You can play as either Batman,Robin or Batgirl,but their combat moves look absolutley retarded. Overall,this is THE WORST Batman game I have EVER PLAYED! ""Batman Forever"" on Genesis was better then this dud,and we all know how bad that game was. I HIGHLY recommend that you DO NOT buy this. The ONLY reason why you MIGHT wanna purchase this,is because it's a pretty rare game,and it could be a part of your game collection,but as far as the game itself goes....IT SUCKS!"
330393,1,"Visually the game looks amazing. The cars are sleek and very detailed especially when driving in the cockpit view. But what held the game and what made me leave a 1 star was the micro transactions.

Coming from a player who LOVED Forza 4, horizon was ok but I fell in love with Forza 4. After you get somewhat into the game you realize that it lacks content because everything else is through micro purchases. Some cars are worth an entire game! Even if they reduced the micro prices, at the end of the day I paid $60, give me the cars to drive. I can understand if they charge for tracks. That I wouldn't mind but I bought the game to drive cars and customize them. Why should I have to buy cars with actual money? I know you can buy cars with in game credits but to earn the amount of credits to purchase some of the cars will take forever.

I really enjoyed Forza 4 and Forza 5 feels like a step back imo. Especially when I enjoyed drifting and downhill drifting. For those who just want a visual game and don't mind a few cars this is for you I guess. But other than that I suggest waiting until this game hits in the $20 range. Glad I returned it for Dead Rising."
122167,1,"It was not the correct card.  Although advertised to fit the Wii, when it arrived it was for a Nintendo game cub., not the Wii.  Very disappointed, but didn't want the hassle and wait of returning it."
34789,1,"I loved this game. When I first played it as a demo a year ago I immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game. I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.

I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called ""Combat Upgrade"" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.

So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003. It breaks my heart that I have lost so many friends and a great experience, but this game is truly forsaken. It is not the same game anymore, it is completely different. If you want Star Wars, take it from me: this is no longer it, and is not worthy of anyone's hard-earned cash."
265685,1,"It has been a long time since I bought a college football game or madden football and I was getting tired of waiting on EA  to make a good madden football game. The last good football game I got was madden 10.
The last ncaa football game I got was 2005.

Now back to ncaa 13, this game is the worse football game I have ever bought and I am not trying to be funny. This game has been copy and paste to another  disc from last year's game but it is terrible.
The colors of the grass, uniforms, and everything is washed out in this game.  The Sound effects is terrible and the tackling sounds is gone.
The crowds in the stands are like cutout cardboard pictures. Nothing looks real and there are no cheerleaders on the field making you feel like you are playing a real college football game. The colors are washed  out so bad that it hurts my eyes to look at the game while I am playing it. out  Do not buy this game. even though  other reviews give this game a 5 and called  this game a great game. They are not telling the truth at all.  There are some reviews who will not write the truth about EA games for some unknown reason. But I am here to tell you the truth and I have nothing to gain  or lose.
NCAA FOOTBALL 12 got a rating of 7.0
NCAA FOOTBALL 13 got a 6.5  but it should have gotten a 4.0 byy gamespot.com
So I took NCAA FOOTBALL 13 back to the game store and trade it in for NCAA 12 and I was pleased. You better get rid of NCAA FOOTBALL 13 before you will not get any money back for it, especially if you paid $65. I paid $44.99 for that copy and I lost about $15 on it.

EA is also making madden 13 and I will not buy this game until I see it even if there are great reviews and rating. If it is not better than madden 10, I will not buy it even though I love playing football. I got a bad feeling that madden 13 is going to be made  very similar to ncaa 13 because EA makes both games and it looks like they do a lot of copying and pasting.

Do not buy this game. Rent it first
Do not buy!!!"
128682,1,Would not charge the battery was able to play plugged in but the cord was very short so I would be sitting literally two feet away from the Xbox
262481,1,"Would you buy a new car that is missing basic standard features like airbags, power steering and power windows?  Yes, you could still drive the car, but it would be a lousy experience and a waste of your money.  That analogy applies here.  Final Fantasy XIV is missing too many basic features.  Add to that the severe lack of content, and you have one game that was simply not ready for release.  It needed about another 6 months.  If this game was still a beta, these issues could be forgiven or understandable.  But since you have to PAY for this mess, its absolutely fair to say this game is not ready.  All the criticism is warranted.

Pros: Great graphics, if your PC can handle it.
Cons: Horrible UI, Lack of content, missing many basic features, boring world, lack of real quests, too much lag, and worst of all, just not fun.

Come back to this game in 6 months (Maybe for the PS3 release). It may be worth your money then."
155840,1,"I never cared much for Aerosmith (take it as you will, that is my opinion), but I always rather liked Guitar Hero. However, this one lets down is near every way possible.

274642,1,"Prior to my update; I had a high opinion of this game.
However, as of January 2013, I deem this game is in no condition to be sold.

It is HEAVILY bugged.
The game publisher THQ went bust, and now no one will fix the many problems still in the game!

Here are just some of the many bugs that will forever go unpatched;

** Story Designer bugs
(No crowd audio during matches in Story Designer. Also players have reported freezing when trying to save a created story among many, many other issues.)
** Superstar threads glitch
(When you create a new attire coloration for some superstars, the attire will appear spotty in-game)
** Ring announcer bug
(The ring announcer will sometimes not announce a superstar as they make their way out to the ring, but instead just say ""AND"")
** Created finishers bug
(Created finishing moves deal considerably less damage than ordinary special moves)
** Various moves cause perma-freezing
(Though not very frequently; at times when a player does a move on another, it will cause a perma-freeze to one or sometimes both superstars)
** 1 count bug
(even after heavily damaging an opponent [A.I. controlled] you'll get only a one-count)
** Broken Attributes
 (Players have tested attributes and proven that many of them have no affect)
** Broken Pin bar
(even after dealing a considerable amount of damage to an opponent [user controlled] their kick out meter will still be large.)
** Triple-Threat matches don't work [A.I]
(A.I. in triple threat matches are the absolute worst. Triple-Threats will always turn into a handicap match one way or another because A.I. only changes target when you hit them. If nobody hits them, guess what? Whoever they were targeted on when the match begins remains their target throughout!)

Virtually every mode of the game has some sort of problem. Including the Universe mode.
I also want to add that the online servers are terrible. Even with 2k now ""supporting"" WWE '13."

483165,1,NO GORE?!
311803,1,"EDIT: Thank you for the corrections, but I stand by my review. Although I do think they could fix it with a slight visual update.

First off I would only reccomend this to a person that has not played the original Fable on Xbox. It's basically Fable one on the Fable two/three engine.
This is actually worse than the Halo one remake, which I didn't think was possible. The problem that was there was absolutely no multiplayer, it just included few downloadable maps for Halo:Reach. Anyway, same issue with this game, but graphics-wise. On the back of the box they said they just re-made the lighting... no they re-made the entire game.

All of the the unique art effects for the fire, the lightning, and even the 'force push' are gone, replaced by generic effects. The character you play as is hideous now, although to be fair most others do look well with their updates. The other one star review was right about the lag, it seems this game is always choppy and still loading even after it is finished, but I haven't had it freeze on me yet. There are bugs like followers not following you through loading screens also.

I am a huge Fable fan so i'll try to enjoy it as much as I can but... it's bad. It's always nice to see the Unreal engine at work, but this is a sloppy remake instead of a port, which it should have been because Fable one has always had very good graphics, it didn't need any updates, just achievements.

I will say again that you probably will enjoy this if you're a casual player, haven't played the original, or just don't remember it that well. It came out ten years ago, so most of the positive reviews will have a nostalgia bias."

I had seen so many good reviews and heard so many good things about X and seeing that they did a part 2 to X, well I had to buy it (needless to say I got the Playstation 2 this Christmas so like I said, not the biggest video gamer).
I wanted to like X I really did.  It had some breathtaking scenes and CGs.  Some of the action was inviting.  The characters themselves were very interesting.  But.  There was one anime movie after the next, very little if any character choices to go here there and everywhere.  The storyline was so convoluted that I could not make heads or tails of what was going on, not to mention I could not understand what this Sin being was (looked like a mutant whale to me)  It was so linear and it was so tight that I got bored easily, very easily.  I felt that there were waaayyy too many tutorials. I could not and cannot understand the character evolution dynamics.  I don't understand the whole structure even with help from the walkthrough books and what I looked up on the net, maybe its just me, but this game did not fit me at all.

133426,1,"I have to say that if there is one game in the past ten years that I believe was an absolute waste of time devoid of any entertainment value, this is it. What didn't I like about this game?

1. Corniest storyline ever. I kept playing hoping it would get better but it actually got progressively worse. The ending? I'm not giving away specific spoilers but lets just say the last boss was freaky in a corny way and the end clip really got me POed. Not a good way to end a game at all.

2. The combat is clunky and cumbersome. Also, you are limited to carrying 24 rounds of ammo for your gun for no reason whatsoever! I angrily left behind ammo because I had too much. This forces you to do melee combat or run. With the crappy camera angles, especially in hallways, that translates to running. Thats not fun.

3. The enemies were poorly made. One in particular is a big man in the front with a woman body attached at the back?!? Lmao. Again, the last enemy in particular was especially awful; especially what happens when you beat him.

4. Repetition redux - You spend alot of time backtracking through areas you've already been through. I'd say of the 10 hours I spent playing, 3 hours were spent exploring new areas.

I spent $15 dollars on this game and still think I got ripped off. Avoid at all costs!"

395840,1,"The game's netcode is absolutely awful, to the point that the game is unplayable.

The host can come around a corner and kill you by the time you pull the trigger.  It's literally almost impossible to kill the host. especially at close quarters inside buildings.  The host can run around the buildings in the center of every map and clean up against anyone.

It's akin to being a new/bad player going up against pros, except every single game match is like that.

What's less fun than dying over and over again?  Getting kills you don't earn.  The horrible spawn system will at times spawn you directly behind an enemy player or the enemy team for an easy kill that is painfully unsatisfying.  I get no excitement for cheap shotting an enemy player who doesn't have a chance to win.

Other times, the game will spawn an entire team right in front of you, and you'll get wasted instantly.

The host is literally a second ahead of all the other players.  He'll see you and kill you by the time you see him.  It makes close quarters combat miserable.  You'll go around the corner or he'll come around the corner and wham, you're dead.  Watching the kill cam confirms that he put enough bullets into you to kill you, but you never shot him once.

The only counter to the host, is the shotguns, but they're noob weapons with extremely huge spread in the crosshairs, and like spawning behind somebody, it's totally unsatisfying.  I hate killing other players with shotguns, and you will too.

The flaws are so miserable, that I can hardly believe they released the game in this condition.

other 'features' this game has are unlimited sprint and unlimited wallrunning, both of which are invitations to die.  Either option gives you momentum which prevents you from changing direction, which means that you're an extremely easy target for the enemy.  I can't tell you how many times I've killed a sprinting or wallrunning player without even trying.

To make matters worse, you have to blow points on perks to ready your weapon faster, which is the only way to make sprinting a feasible option.

So, basically, all players do is camp.  It's the only viable strategy.

The game is played like this :  There are hardpoints on every map from which to camp from :  a wall, a concrete barricade, a window, basically anything you can camp behind and shoot from without exposing much of your own body to make you an easy target.  In between Hard points is no mans land, being out in the open with no cover, thus exposing your entire body to the enemy.

Being caught in no mans land by enemy players is death.

The only way to advance in the game, is by sprinting from hard point to hard point, spending as little time as possible in no mans land.

I feel like every time I catch an enemy player in no mans land, I get a kill I don't deserve.  I usually never take any damage from these players.  It's almost like executing an unarmed prisoner with a firing squad... there's not a chance in hell they'll survive.  So where's the fun?

There is fun in fair firefights where 2 players both find themselves in no mans land having a firefight.  Or when 2 players find themselves both in cover at hard points, having a firefight from hard point to hard point.

But sadly, these encounters are a rarity.  Most players are not willing to take the risk of entering no mans lands, and for good reason : it's almost impossible to survive.

By camping at a hard point, even if you have a 4 players spawn in front of you, you still have the chance of picking an enemy off before his buddies can flank or rush your position.

But, if you're caught in no mans land against 4 players, you're instantly dead.

I understand why the game suffers from so much lag and host advantage.  They're using peer to peer hosting rather than dedicate servers.

But I do not understand why the spawn system is so awful, and why you must burn so many perks on having any ability to run and gun.

It's just bad, broken game design.  I get no fun out of being killed from behind by a player who spawned directly behind me, and I get even less fun out of killing someone else from behind.

I get no fun out of having an entire team spawn right in front of me and getting wiped out instantly.

I get no fun out of wasting all my perks and points trying to make run and gun viable, when it never really will be and is a total waste of time.

Players who design their class around camping hard points have a huge advantage over players who design their class for run and gun in no mans land.  Players who don't want to camp are punished severely for even trying to attack.

*Some hard points with high ground are grenade and rocket catches.  These 'catch points' are more effective than others, but it's countered by the 'catch' design which makes it easy for someone to throw a grenade or shoot a rocket at you.  It's a nice little risk reward system.  I've gotten a lot of kills from them, and a lot of deaths from them.  It's smart map design.

**  The best feature in the game are special abilities for your choice of special soldiers.  It's unlocked by earning points that aren't lost when you die.  It's basically the support killstreaks from MW3, except it's always active and you don't have to sacrifice your ability to earn kill streaks to use it.  It's the smartest idea Treyarch has ever had, and it adds an extra layer to excitement as the game match progresses.  Unfortunately, some of these special weapons take less or no skill to use, which can be frustrating when you die without any chance of winning.  I don't think the special abilties were balanced well.  The more noob abilties should take more time and points to unlock, to compensate for their 'noobness'.  I feel like they never even play tested these abilities, like the mine layer abilty, or the gravity spikes.  You don't even have to aim these abilties.

I love the new jet pack.  It's fun and extremely responsive.  It controls perfectly and is always fun to use.  It's by far the best implementation of a jet pack (or jumping for that matter) ever in videogames.  A pure pleasure.

Wall running is also intuitive and fun.

the guns feel good to aim around.

The great controls add an extra layer of excitement to the game.

Sprinting causes the screen to jerk minimally, which makes you feel more like a machine.  can't decide if I like or dislike this, but it certainly sets the game apart from other call of dutys.

It all feels really polished.

Sometimes your character will not grab a ledge, causing you to fall to your death.

Shooters are all about gun porn, and Black Ops 3 has some of the best weapon renders ever.

And the gun designs are all new.  There's no M4, M16, AK47, USP, M9, UMP, MP5..... none of that.  They're all new designs.  What a pleasant surprise.  I realize that usually when these guns make an appearance in call of duty, they always get reskinned and usually get reshaped, but you can usually still tell exactly what gun they are.  Designing completely new weapons is a big risk because it severs the link between fiction and reality.  Most shooters have a lot of real world weapons to ground the game in reality.  BO3 takes a big risk to go all out.  So it's great that theyve done this.  You can still see the precursor to many weapons.  The weavil was inspired by the Rcp90, a gun which I hate.  But i like the way the weevil looks.  So it's like, they put all this effort into fixing up old guns to look not only different, but way better.  The ARK7 is a futuristic AK47, and so on.

The graphics are great.  Beautiful textures and shaders.  5/5 for visuals.  It's a massive improvement over their previous games and takes full advantage of next gen hardware.  It's got the best looking hi res assets you will ever see.
I also love the weapon reload and death animations.

I also love the player's arms and hands.  Getting this right is essential to any first person shooter, and it looks fantastic.  The best renders you have ever seen in any FPS.

I didn't realize Treyarch was capable of these visuals.  It's the kind of massive leap forward that makes you wonder who developed it.

I'm not sure how to describe black ops 3's graphics compared to their earlier games COD3, World at War, Black Ops, and Black Ops 2.  When I say it's their best looking game ever, I mean that at the time these games came out, they were not impressive as this game is now.

It's a mind blowing leap forward for Treyarch, and it runs at 60 framers per second.

It makes me wonder if it's the best looking game ever made.  Maybe MGS5 has better face renders, but you only see those close up in cutscenes, so it's not really a fair comparison.

I can't really decide if it's the best looking game ever...  I don't feel comfortable saying it is or isn't, but it must be good to generate that kind of confusion.

Suffice to say that Black Ops 3 is as good as games can look.

I can talk about how great the graphics are all day, but it doesn't matter if the game is unplayable.  And the multiplayer is unplayable.

It's Sad that all Treyarch's hard work as gone to waste, but it's also true.

For me, the whole point of multiplayer is to test your skill against other living players.  That's what I find fun about it.  Strategy comes in a distant second.  You will find both lacking here.

There's fun to be had here in the well designed maps, but the Lag, Host advantage, Net Code and Spawn points make you suffer to get to it.

Every once in a while, you'll run into another player while you're both in no mans land, and have a sick shootout putting both your skills to the test...

And then the host comes around the corner and kills you instantly."
356657,1,i bought this game at gamestop today and at first i was like wow soo cool then after the beginning part the game goes down hill. went driving for 40minutes no enemies at all i restarted thwe game and this time it was just a hassle gameplay is lacking. graphics are amazing but that shouldn't make the game itself sadly.
449662,1,I can not play the disk version of this game. the graphic resolution is worse than bad. I think this game is too old to play on my system.
42340,1,"I'm flabbergasted for two reasons:

First, how did Activision manage to make a PS2 sequel to a PS1 game that's actually WORSE than the original??  It defies logic! This game has the absolute WORST CAMERA ANGLES OF ALL-TIME!!!  To top it off, the character movement and combat is ""wooden"" at best.  I have better games on my friggin cell phone.

Second, how in the LL Cool J did so many Amazon users give this a good review??  Argh!

You'd be better off playing PS1 'Tenchu: Stealth Assassin' again than wasting your time on this stinker.  Seriously.

ADDED:
Playing Wrath of Heaven is like playing the unfinished test-version of Stealth Assasin."

and that make the game become a piece of trash
I totally not recommended unless you like to waste your $$
.
UPDATE
Ubisoft hate the gamers
the game constantly crash or get stuck on the loading screen
and if you're lucky enough to be able too log in
you may end up to fall under the map
then people write down articles about the PC desktop is dying
sure it is because company like Ubisoft is constantly releasing unfinished product
my advice to everyone is;
stop buy games with Ubisoft signature
that is the only way to force THEM TO DO THEIR FREAKING JOB"
194791,1,"I'm sorry to say but this game just sucks.  I hate when people tell me that the battle system is awesome, because it really isn't.  I played for a few hours and didn't mind it at first because yes it was interesting, but when I actually look at it I realized that it was all unnecessary.  It takes way to much to time do and almost very easy to understand only after a few hours.  I compare this game to FF13 because what I feel when you make a new battle system, there should be room for innovation.  With this game's battle style it just felt like once you got it, you got it.  There's no way to experiment with it and try to challenge yourself.  I know a lot of people say FF13 was horrible but I actually liked it because when I played I was able to try different combinations of characters and such which allowed it be very challenging at times.  Like I said, once this game is figured out there's really nothing else to do.  The story was blah and the side missions aren't at all that interesting.  This game is definitely not my fave."
255249,1,"Just No. These controllers are not original N64 brand. I've bought and used more than 10 of these controllers. They work fine for a few days, but they all inevitably develop faulty joysticks and become useless just like the controllers you're most likely trying to replace."
215204,1,"Just another FPS that has been slapped together.

SINGLEPLAYER:  The story is so stupid and, as others have stated, they do not explain ANYTHING.  You get grabbed by some team of cliche people.  The hot head who smarts off all the time, the girl who automatically defends you when criticism comes up, and the ethnic leader of the RESISTANCE.  There were times where I actually laughed at the stupid voice overs in the cut scenes.

MULTIPLAYER:  This sums up the whole multiplayer experience: ""THE RICH GET RICHER"".  The whole battle point system is so stupid.  Everyone just camps and hides so they can rack up points and then they get health boosts as well.  So you've got a guy that is harder to kill, hiding in a house, racking up points.  Then he calls in a chopper that DOMINATES the entire map.  Spawn?  Killed by chopper.  Spawn and run.  Killed by chopper.  There is only one anti-chopper weapon in the game and the little drone is so hard to get out and aim at the chopper you might as well try to lead the chopper with an RPG.  Basically it is a camp fest that ends in a godlike chopper reigning down fury on everyone as they spawn.

Probably the worst FPS I have ever played.  And that is saying a lot, because I really hate Black Ops."
204276,1,too much lag and bad combat system it is mostly jut combo ing the hit out of people and then switching in. boring.
340699,1,Probably the worst game in the Tales series.
260851,1,Mine was sold by J-Tech Digital and does NOT display in 1080p!  I had a better screen clarity with 480p using the component cable (Red;Blue;Green + right/left audio plugs). I'm not missing anything. There is no switch or button to toggle settings. The white case has no hole in it to stick a paperclip through. In fact you can easily pop the inside components out with some slight pressure and examine the electronics. No switch or button anywhere on the circuit board. I wonder if some people think they are seeing 1080p when it's actually 480p. Maybe other sellers are not selling knock-offs and maybe J-Tech is. Maybe J-Tech doesn't realize what they're selling. I am not one of those lucky people who may have received a functioning 1080p unit. Now J-Tech wants me to pay for return shipping with tracking and upon receipt and examination they will issue a refund. They'll probably resell it and someone else will have to deal with the same frustration.
235279,1,I really had high hopes for this game as it seemed like a pretty cool game if it could only work properly... to bad
337720,1,"When I plug in the mic jack it cuts off sound on the left headset.  Thinking my Sound Blaster audio card had gone bad, I disabled it and re-enabled my onboard audio, same thing. When the stereo jack and mic are plugged in at the same time the left headset sound just cuts off.  When I unplug the mic jack, the headset sounds return to normal.  I checked all sound levels and settings including, motherboard settings, its not my PC

Reading other complaints on mic and left headset sound issues here and other sites; I've concluded that the mic - left headset integration has a chance of not working or breaking down some time later.  Refunded."

Words just fail to describe how crappy this is.  There's no replayability in it either, cuz in the end, it doesn't matter if you're a cyborg or a full human; wether you join Pilot or fight against him:  cuz the end encounters are exactly the same.

Extremely disappointed in this game.  Wait for a few months when the game is $20 bucks; then it might be worth it."
259004,1,"I tried... I really tried to like these games.... but they stink, too arcade and childish for me to enjoy, seen it's day, buy something modern like Bioshock 3."
250920,1,"I bought this product with the intent to use it for my online Battlefield 2 game.
The product was shipped fast, and it is as described. I am very happy for the choice I made.

this is an update:  my mouse doesn't work properly anymore. It randomly disconnects/freezes and won't work until I reboot my computer (or I put it on sleep mode and restart my computer again). I think this is a clear indication of a Software/driver issue, not Hardware.  I am using Win 7, 64bit.

Apart from this issue I love my mouse. Its a great product and worked flawlessly until this issue. The issue became so frequent now (sometimes after 5-10 minutes of use) that I cannot use my mouse anymore. I just contacted Logitech customer support. Hopefully that will solve the issue.  I'll keep you guys informed.

I felt the need to update my rating to 1 star. Besides having the issue with the mouse device, now I have to deal with slow Logitech Customer Support. It's been a week since I first contacted them. Last time I replied to their email response was two and a half days ago and I am still waiting to hear back from them."
176036,1,"Hello everyone, first of all let me start by saying that I do not have this piece of garbage, thank god, then why am I giving it a review, well here is the reason, and I hope it helps.

I am the owner of a MAIL BOXES ETC. franchise and as you may know we handle a variety of shipping services such as UPS and Fedex, so everyday a lot of packages come in and out of the store, but the ones that come very single day are the return for service xbox 360 system.

In a regular week people come in and send their junk, I mean XBOX, to get fixed and they doit with the return service Microsoft offers, so they don't have to pay anything, after all, they already got robbed with the system, and as I was telling you, in a week we get around 20 to 30 systems to send back, and some people come back to resend the one they already got fixed about 2 or 3 times after the first service. So I have asked people what is the problem with their Xbox, some have told me that I just stop running, others that it burned up after a few hours of game play and my favorite, after having it for 2 months the image is white and black.

What I am traying to say is that do not waste you hard earned cash in junk, get a PS2 OR PS3, if it is in your budget, and anjoy with out the worry of having to get your system fixed after 5 minutes of play time, I have had my ps2 since 2000 and still works great, as my PS3 wich I have had for a year now, and now problems at al even afater 10 hours of play time.

So In conclusion stay away form the xbox AT ALL COST!!!!!"
317325,1,"I could write for hours about how excited I was about this game ...
I could also write for hours about how let down I was when I played it.
I could write for hours about how much I wanted the game to end so many times...

I won't because this game robbed me of enough of my time - as a LONG TIME fan of horror and survival games... don't waste your time with this game."
315322,1,"I only recieved the game box :( No disc, box was broken."
138158,1,"I'll start on the low notes and end on the very few high notes.
I agree with everyone else on this. There is NO way these screenshots are from the PC version. I have an excellent video card that makes Oblivion and Fallout look amazing but this looks like a rip off of GTA3. That includes the poor graphics, clunky controls and no mouse use on ESC screens??!!
Character Design: This was a joke. What's the point of going through all that tweaking and refining of the character if you won't see that detail once the game starts? Even though it allowed more freedom than most games, it was very limited for such a new game.
Save/Loads: I was in the beginning of the game and was about to test how far I could jump or fall and saved before doing it. I died and was sent all the way back to the prison? What's the point of a save system if it doesn't let you load where you saved?
Music: YES, it has become a staple of the free roaming shooter. It was highly dominated by music that I really don't listen to. It was like 20 yr olds in LA made the soundtrack and then said, ""what do rockers listen to?"" and they had NO idea so they just through together Pop and Rock from the 80's to the present in one botched mass.
Somewhat good:
I had no issues with clipping or jaggy blending of the environment. But the graphics aren't that good so it takes some of this spotlight away.
If you are facing the camera, and target a car or person behind you, you can throw a grenade or other items over your shoulder which was cool but it made the controls to turn around and run another direction very slow.
I had no frame rate issues that others have had. It ran smooth and fluid but that's a small victory today.
Sorry but I think this a $20 game at best and there's no need to buy it if you're already playing GTA.
Oh..They added drugs and Alcohol..Yeah...simulated drugs and alcohol..I don't get it.
Oh..They purposely left the Steam logo off the case. If I knew it was Steam Powered, I wouldn't have bought it."

459746,1,"The name of this controller is deceiving, while it sounds and it cool with the two Z buttons, as soon as I played with it I hated it. This is one of the worst generic controllers on the market by far, I remember I purchased this controller the first time in black and the second time in purple and I only bought it because it was cheaper than the original Wavebird by Nintendo. When I bought it in black it was $10 and in purple for $20 nether online I bought both in store. So I essentially screwed myself buying both since the black was from a local gaming store/arcade who I knew the owner from church, the other one was a store I went to before the other owner opened the arcade. So all together it was a $30 screw up on my own part.

But as soon as I got my hands on this controller and played games with it within 5 minutes of playing my hands started to hurt. Not only did my hands hurt in some cases my characters controlled themselves. I remember while I played with this controller there was a section in the Gamecube precautions booklet that I read that it was recommended to buy nintendo products with the official Nintendo Seal on products to get full compatibility and the full experience. Well, anyway the store I bought it from sold used video games, accesories and other related items, and the owner told me he had one controller left. So at first I was excited because (little did I know) I wrongfully assumed at the time it was a Nintendo Brand and instead it was this pelican brand which is obviously a 3rd party generic manufacturer. So since the store I bought this from known as Stained Glass Eye a local store in which is in walking distance of where I live, which didn't allow for returns and refunds though it did allow you to get store credit for items you brought in, which was pointless to me anyway. I sold it to a another local game store who did allow refunds and returns and would give cash or store credit.  I

Otherwise I do not recommend this controller for anyone who only prefers to buy first party brands and has the kind of money to buy first party brands accessories and items. I only recommend this controller to anyone who can't afford the First party brand (such as Nintendo).

I do have one piece of advise to those who would rather buy generic and pay a cheaper price make sure you be careful with your hands while you are playing your video games as this will cause hand injuries, unless you have a special pair of gloves to protect your hands. Otherwise just be careful and be attentive and stop playing if your hand(s) starts to hurt or if you don't like the generic controller, save the extra money to buy the first party brand believe me its worth it but it is not worth it to buy this Generic Pelican brand!

I did however when I took both controllers to the arcade I noticed the store had a Nintendo Wavebird which I bought and gave the store the two generic controllers and only paid $13 for it, so I did make my money back and repaid myself for my mistake. This controller is a financial and gaming mistake for any die hard Nintendo fan, who loves the First party brands."
427703,1,Waaaaaaaaaay too expensive.
2409,1,I have used a lot of third party expansion packs for the Nintendo 64 and they all have been problematic causing crashes and other issues. The only one that works without a problem is the Nintendo brand Expansion Pak.
30003,1,"I am going to reveal the ending, so do not read ahead if you still want to play this game.
Many others have already posted their opinions here, so I will not go through the whole game in detail.
But as many others have said, the voice-acting for the Obi-Wan character is ridiculously, unintentionally humorous -- the actor sounds like a guy with a head cold trying to imitate Ewan McGregor doing Obi-Wan, exaggerating the distinctive traits McGregor's Scottish accent -- so even lilts in his voice are thrown into hyperdrive. (as exaggerated as the honker the graphics dept. gave to Qui-Gon Jinn -- yes, the bridge on Liam Neeson's nose may be somewhat big, but since when did he have Karl Malden's nose?)
The game is unfortunately lacking in the graphics department -- sometimes you can't see features on faces.
But onto the ending. The game is fun, with a handful of challenging levels -- mostly due to the swarms of droids that come your way and droids taking stance behind high-powered laser cannons.
But it's marred by a disappointingly quick and all-too-easy ending. The moment arrives -- you finally meet Darth Maul. Just like in the movie, you stand behind the laser wall and watch as Qui-Gon is struck down by Maul.
And finally the wall opens, you hold your breath, ready for a tough battle -- one that you may have to play repeatedly until you put together the right string of moves and blocks to take him out before your health runs out. But it's not to be.
Darth Maul is ridiculously easy to defeat. I beat him on my first try and in less than a minute. And you have to fight him twice -- as once you take him down the first time, he gets a new, full meter of health. So in less than a minute, I drew down two full health meters. I felt cheated, to say the least.
I remember fighting against Mace Windu to have to reach the next level, and I had to go toe to toe against him some 20 to 30 times before I finally beat him. I was expecting at least a battle on that level of difficulty, but it ended up being the easiest level of the whole game. All I had to do was slash at him and use some force saber twirls and Maul was done.
How in the world could the game's makers create such a lackluster, lifeless, no-threat ending battle? I was left extremely wanting, and if it were a movie, I would have angrily asked for my money back. I cannot say enough how disappointing the ending was. Even more now, the Darth Maul character cries out for a game of his own. One can only wish -- for this Maul must have been a clone or imposter to go down with nary a fight."

50203,1,"Read the other reviews and you'll notice a trend. My controller lasted about one month before the right analog stick got uncallibrated. It makes my one game, MVP Baseball 2005, pointless since my players just dive around the field all day long.

What's sad is that this problem has been occurring in these controllers for over 3 years and they still keep on selling them. (Too bad I didn't read the reviews first.) Knowingly selling a defective product should be illegal. Shame on you logitech! Shame on you!"
201255,1,"I liked the N64 game, so I was expecting some silly sci-fi game with a plot that didn't really make sense or matter. But the gameplay was just so boring and repetitive, that I didn't feel like this was even worth the $5 this was on sale for.

On the rail shooters can be a lot of fun, but the levels in this game and the enemies you fight are dull. Just holding the trigger and strafing is all it takes to move on, except for some obnoxious controls during bosses.

The worst for me was that the game's co-op was very weak. Normally the game has one character you control on screen with the nunchuk while shooting with the Wii Remote pointing at the screen. But two player mode doesn't add a second character--it just lets another person shoot at the screen! There's no dodging or special attacks, just holding the trigger and making it harder to see what's going on.

Something positive is the addition of subtitles in multiple languages (including Japanese) but the dialogue is so hard to make out and silly that it doesn't really matter. Anyway, when subtitles are the best part of the game, it doesn't bode well for the rest of it."
207736,1,"Ok let me say first of all I really wasn't a big fan of Madden 10.  I was a top 100 player on Ncaa 10 and Madden 09 so I know my football games.

I downloaded this demo just out of curiosity and let me say this was the worst 10 minutes of my life !!! This game is so bad, so retarded , so incredibly horrible I'm seriously having trouble putting into words what trash this really is.

I mean if by new graphics engine they mean a massive Cluster of people running around and you have zero control over what is going on ,  Then yes this is a new graphics engine !!  I played one drive on defense, one drive on offense then literally stoped playing because it was so PATHETIC !!!  The playbook will literally remind you of madden 93 playbook for sega genesis (  NOT JOKING I AM SERIOUS )  I snaped the ball 3 times on offense and was sacked 3 strait times without having a chance to even throw a pass !!

Like I said I wasn't a big fan of Madden 10 but theres no comparison here !!  Don't go out and buy this garbage just because you hate EA sports man !! You would be better of buying madden 03 for Ps2 !!!  THIS GAME IS A JOKE !!!!!!!

Also one more thing !!  If by some chance the makers of this game come on here and read this I would just like to say,  HAHAHAHAHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA  at your attempt to make a football game !!!"

You basically just play the storyline over and over again, but on different difficulties, so there is no replay value whatsoever.  Also because of the auction house where you actually pay with money out of your wallet, the game has become incredibly gear dependent, and tedious to play.  Unless you want to shell out another $20-$40 bucks to by somewhat decent items to beat inferno.

Blizzard fails to keep people interested in it, patch 1.03 made about 95% of the player base quit."
284495,1,Waste of money.  Looks and plays like something from PS2.  I thought this was supposed to be a good looking game?  I couldn't get into the games atmosphere because it looks so bad.  Returning.  The fact that this and Skyrim share a gaming platform should make the developers of this game ashamed of themselves.  I give this a solid 2/10 lol.
221891,1,"Over all the novelty had me excited. But just like other reviewers mentioned, the laggy and unresponsive controls kill this game before it even got off the ground. Not sure how this got through any sort of quality control."
202783,1,"The written instructions for this game are almost non-existent. Instead, they decided to tell you what to do by writing it on the screen as you're playing. The only problem is that the writing is very tiny and in gold, which blends into the background. I don't even get thru deciphering it before it disappears. What's with that? I should be able to get the writing off of the screen by pressing a button, not have it disappear on its own. So now I don't know what to do.

This is just another crappy 3DS game. Thank goodness that I used my $20 Amazon credit to buy it, so I'll be able to recoup most of my money when I trade it in."
101729,1,"Do you enjoy watching a hundred dialog screens between each 90-second game?

Screens like: ""Hi I'm Dr Node"" [press A button] ""Welcome to Big Brain Academy"" [press A button] ""We are going to have a lot of fun"" [press A button] ""first lets register"" [press A button] ""let's see your score"" [press A button] ""your score was ____"" [press A button] ""great job"" [press A button] ""try to get more next time"" [press A button] ""here's a bronze medal"" [press A button] ""let's see your score again"" [press A button] ""What a big brain you have"" [press A button] ""I haven't said anything informative yet have I"" [press A button] ""isn't this cute?""

The brain games themselves are fun, but the hassle of getting to each one exceeds the pleasure of actually playing. (This complaint is similar to that of Wii Fit, where each exercise is punctuated by intro and outro dialogs that destroy any rhythm you might have built up.) It seems like a lot of Wii games do this, which is why i don't buy a lot of Wii games anymore.

""Wii Big Brain Academy"" will be collecting dust on the shelf. :("
164451,1,"Frustrating! Bizarre! Cheap! Confusing! Junk!

Wait ... beyond junk.  It's bizzare in how bad it is.  The controls are so bad I actually hurt myself.  The graphics are cheap and crappy.  The on screen instructions are even worse than the game play.  The interface was confusing.

Only two games are slightly playable, skeet ball and ring toss.  My son, who is 7, did enjoy these two for about 5 minutes only because it was a game we could play together but I highly doubt he will ever want to play it again because the graphics are so bad.  Instead we will go back to Wii Sports bowling and Wii Play fishing.

The volley ball game is UNPLAYABLE, very complex and just bizzare.  Just try serving, go ahead try it! Then try hitting the ball after serving, button A+upswing to set, button B+down swing to hit, shake the control like crazy to do a super spike.  Now do this all in about 2 seconds.  No? couldn't do it?  We gave up on this game mid-way.  So back to Wii Sports Tennis.

And how about that kayacking?  Can you even tell what is meant by the Wii remote icon over all 4 players, even though two players are CPU players.  And occassionally the Wii remote icons will turn into a Red X, even over the CPU players.  I guess those CPU players' Wii remote lost their signal. Back to ANY Wii racing game I ever played (Wii Play cow race, Wii-ware racing games)

Oh and what was it with multi player mode?  You pick multiplayer and you are shown 4 boxes with two Wii remote icons in each with no explaination.  Ya that makes PERFECT sense to me.

The controls are so horrible and unresponsive, this lack of response will make you swing, flick harder and harder.  This caused my arms to hurth.  No really hurt.  All the crazy movements I do with Wii Sports boxing, or Wii Fit boxing NEVER hurt my arm.  Yet M&M volleyball hurht my arm like a Little League pitcher who threw too much during a season.

This game did do one good thing, it made me appreciate all the great Nintendo titles suchs as Sports, Fit, Sports Resort, Mario Super Sluggers.  I longed for those games as my wrist and armed hurt from over flicking.

I wish there was such a thing as a no star rating because I would have given that.  We did get it for free as someone else was going to donate it to Salvation Army.  I may help this game continue it's journey to Salvation Army, however this posses a moral delima to me.  Can I, a fan of video games, contribute to the life span of this bizzarely horrible game?  No I can not, I think I shall have to destroy this disc.  I just imagine the look of excitement on a child's face as she sees this game waiting for her, only for her to realize she's been ripped off.  Ripping off children is as low as it gets in my consumer book, DONT DO IT!

Don't buy this or any other M&M titles unless Mars Co. post an open letter of appology explaining that it was an executive's 5 year who programed this thing, and he is now fired and being sued by the company.  In fact I DEMAND an explaination.  This is one brand that I will NEVER buy a game from again."
98490,1,"I so want to get this game! I loved the reviews and I have been very, very close to buying it. However, despite lifting the activations limit, the game still needs online activation when your first install it. Please, please remove activation altogether so I can get it! I just can't bring myself to buy a game that I may not be able to install in the future.

It's a superb game and I really want to play it and add it to my collection. Please listen to buyers who don't want activations. Most of them are people who have been fans of the developer for years, like me.

Here's an extract from an interview with 2K's community manager, Elizabeth Tobey, who clarified the limited activations issue saying,

""Our other methods of copy protection remain. You will still have to activate your copy, and you will still need to keep the disc in the drive. SecuROM has not been removed - just the activation limits on number of installs and number of computers you can install BioShock on simultaneously.

As I promised that the activation limits would go away, I can promise that if we ever stop supporting BioShock in the ways you speak of, we will release a patch so that the game is still playable. I believe, as you seem to, that BioShock will be the kind of game we will want to revisit 5, 10, 15 or more years from now. I want my copy to be playable, just as you do, and so does 2K.""

I know that Elizabeth kindly promises to remove activation, but I prefer it to be removed now. I just can't trust that they will patch this out as I have been tricked many times before by companies claiming to correct issues at a later time."

467822,1,I did not like this game at all. I don't like communicating with still pictures. There is no direction for you to follow. You could wander around for a long time not knowing where to go and what to do. This is one of the worst games I have ever played.
438823,1,"It's the same thing every year. This game has become and steady steam of revenue for EA and they don't have to change anything to keep on making money. If you're listening 2K Sports, I would seriously spend whatever it took to get another game like All Pro Football."
415416,1,"Xbox One console accessories are still in it's inception and product like these are nothing but marketing stunts.

1. The battery doesnt even fit into the controller like a regular battery. The lid cannot be placed over it, so it has to be used non-lidded, running the risk of the battery pack falling out.
2. The USB cable is not stretch and bend resistant, which mean it will break under stress. Since their is no currently efficient charging dock on market using the cable provided is not reliable. If you do get a charging dock and try to use it with this battery it probably will charge extremely slow due manufacture non-compatibility. Like charging a phone battery with a charger of a different brand.
3. The battery life is random gamble, revealing poor quality control distribution. Consumers have mixed reviews, one claims it diminishes battery life over time, another says the console recognizes the battery to be depleted and others say it has lasted considerably long.

That being taken into consideration, those who purchase this product have a considerably high chance to be disappointed.

Recommendation: Only purchase this product from a trusted brand. Which is not available."
194273,1,"I got this because I read that this was the Sonic equivalent  to Mario Kart. Hubby and I only played one race and gave this up. There is a small selection of characters to choose from. Hubby was disappointed that Knuckles was not an option. Huge downside is that you can not choose your vehicle. The vehicle comes with what character you chose. So if you pick to play Tails, you automatically get an airplane and that's it.  To me that was a huge downside and sort of the deal breaker. We found the course sort of boring. There is a commentator as you race as well. Drove me nuts, but hubby liked it.

Overall, skip this game and stick to Mario Kart. This isn't worth the time."
22378,1,"22 Characters? More like 16. And It's not even wrestling, it's smacking each other around with pinning. Don't buy it, it'll only kill your love of the simpsons. It only got a star because the dialouges are funny."
308969,1,This game is horrible.  Maps are way too big.  6 on 6 domination.  I saw zero enemies and captured 3 flags in a row.  This is nothing like COD.  Rent it from redbox or gamefly first.
243656,1,"For newcomers, this is definitely the best in the series for gameplay...but if you're just looking for a new cover-based shooter, this whole series is more about conversations and storyline so you may need to look elsewhere. Not only that, but the big plot points and emotional scenes in this game will have little to no impact if you haven't at least played ME2, so there is really no point playing this game by itself. That would be like watching the series finale of a TV show without watching any prior episodes. Sure, you might enjoy it, but you're missing out on a HUGE portion of the game's appeal.

In the end, though, this game and this series as a whole was just a big waste of time for me. After devoting countless hours to the Mass Effect series (games, books, developer diaries, etc), being completely enveloped in the game's world and elaborate history, and giving this series more love than any other work of fiction I have ever come across, I've completely written off this game series and the developer (Bioware). The ending completely kills everything that makes the game's story and world believable. For me, it was just so embarrassingly stupid and crazier than anything I could have ever possibly imagined. Months later and I still can't get my head around how goofy and ridiculous it was. And with a story that dissolves into dirt in the game's final hour, you are literally left with nothing.

Collector's Edition: only worth getting for the Prothean DLC.

PC version: looks sharper and runs faster than the console versions, has hotkeys. No controller support. Requires Origin to run (which is a piece of software I used to support but have since realized it's like Bioware's games...pointless and unnecessary)."
151237,1,"There is some important storyline you need to see but this game is crap other than that. Imagine kingdom hearts with a different totally random slot battle. That is how stupid this game is. Not the final fantasy that I wanted when i went to play this game. This game sucks and it is the last square game i ever played as a result.

If the creators of these final fantasy games want better sales, make the Final Fantasy VII remake we have wanted for so long. The fans deserve BETTER."
170925,1,"I do not even have to play this to know it will suck. Activision crapped on PC gamers again and did a crappy port with this. The first review convinced me it was a hack job for the PC, too bad Blizzard is now part of this company.
I quote Vygramul: ""But perhaps the least forgivable aspect of this game is the lack of care in developing the UI. Most of it is confusing, made almost cryptic by a constant references to xbox controls. So here I am on my PC, and it says ""Select to go back"" and ""Y to..."" or ""A to..."" or ""RB to..."" This lack of attention to detail might, I hazard to guess, have had something to do with Activision laying off the entire multiplayer development staff."""
436243,1,Too lazy right now to provide an in depth review. This is my least favorite FF game of all. Story is garbage. Game play is different. Just unfinished and unpolished.... unless you buy the DLC... and even that is turning out to be a extended turd.
302816,1,"This game has some major issues. 1a. This is the SLOWEST loading game I've ever played. 1. There is an ""interviewer"" constantly asking the main characters. Not needed, and annoying. The same could be accomplished simply by having that character narrate. 2. There are ""choices"" in the game which allow two different outcomes. Most are - one choice is very dumb. Then they show you how smart you are since you picked the obvious correct one. 3. The ending is rediculous on many levels. 4. Much time is taken by the game while loading the next Act, Scene or whatever. Several minutes in some cases. Same when your character is killed and you have to restart that scene. 5. The main context, time travel, changes its own rules during the game - inconsistent. Shooting scenes are inconsistent. In some cases, you can kill all the bad guys in seconds. In others, it's almost impossible without being 'killed' a few times until you figure a workaround.  6. I found the controls to be lagging, depending on the scene, for no apparent reason. Replay the scene a few times, suddenly they're perfect.  7. I play on Xbox One. There is sometimes a menu insert showing the buttons to use for various actions (slow time, etc). The icons on those buttons are just plain weird. I never did figure them out, just Googled and got a good list someone had posted. 8. The characters were attractive, believable, and well-acted. Yet for some reason several had to be killed off, no matter which options you choose. That added nothing to the main story in my opinion. 9. Did I mention the ending? It takes many tries to play thru the final fight, even on the Easy setting. In my case, probably a couple dozen tries. And if you fail, you get no credit for the successes, you start the whole fight over. I've read where some players took a hundred times. What's up with that? It leaves a sour taste in your mouth - hence my one star. Did I mention that this game is unbelievably SLOW?"
437669,1,"Somehow, multiplayer still pairs pro-level gamers with newbies to create epically one-sided multiplayer matches. I can't get anyone to play this game with me because a new player will loose in spectacular fashion. Look elsewhere."
353517,1,Heard great things about this game.  I hated it.
260472,1,"The game, when it works is ok, but it crashes and freezes so often, I no longer play it.

MLB is clearly the redheaded step child of 2K sports games. It consistently freezes when you try to skip the ""clutch moment"" cinematic and sometimes when you watch the darn thing at the end of the game. Freezes isn't the right word, it goes to the batting setup but the pitch NEVER comes, and the ""set your Xbox clock to some day in June 2012"" fix is crap, Doesn't work. It sometimes freezes when base running.

It is a reload of a yearly sports game offering. It's not much different than 11 or 2k13. Both are reportedly buggy as heck too, although I'll probably never buy a 2K sports game again, even being a fan of the NBA games."
336947,1,"What a waste of money. For starters the name is absolutely inaccurate... this thing does not upscale anything at all. It does output at 480p, albeit with LOTS of artifacts, and stops working without warning. I've tested it several times with audio signal also coming out of the HDMI, and it makes weird popping noises and the screen will go blank. You just don't know when it will stop working. You have to keep unplugging and plugging it back in to fix it. I notice it heats up a lot too even when the Wi is powered off, so you might as well disconnect it when you're not playing. I got what I paid for and I guess I will have to order a similar adapter and hope and pray that it won't be cheap junk like this one.

Edit: I went and bought the Tendak version a few weeks later. It works flawlessly."
396668,1,"There's almost no content to this game. No real single player (no EA, the waves-mode doesn't count), no community servers, no way to play with AI with friends, no space battles, mediocre unlocks when playing online, too few maps, too many empty game modes, and just no reason to play.

But we already knew all that.

My biggest problem is this game will be unplayable soon, like actually truly unplayable, a trend that's becoming disturbing in the gaming world. On the PS4 the servers are still pretty active, it'll probably remain that way for a while, but the online experience is a barren wasteland on PC and Xbox one with either EXTREMELY long wait times to find a match, or, in my experience, absolutely no matches found on PC. It's been this way since release day, and for some reason PS4 is the only one that's survived.

My 1 star rating is for EA selling me a full-priced game with $20 of content that is dead on release for 2/3 major platforms, and not even seeming to care about it. The graphics are amazing, the game plays well, and it is rather balanced... if you can even play it. I don't ask for much EA, all they have to do is add AI play and let me invite friends who can come and go as they please. Let me choose what maps I want to play in what order and what game modes to do, don't make Titanfall and Battlefront a habit."
207047,1,"First off, I have always been a huge fan of the Fallout games, Including Fallout 3.

But, this game is horribly broken. It has been a very long time since I've seen a BSOD (blue screen of death), but Bethesda and this game have brought them back. The game reboots my computer constantly with blue screen crashes. I haven't seen those in 3 or 4 years. There is nothing wrong with my computer, except that it is a tad outdated. The drivers and direct x are all up to date and work perfectly with everything, except this game. The fact that you also need that piece of crap steam just to run the game makes it complete garbage.

Do yourself a favor and don't give Bethesda more money to ruin the Fallout name. Hopefully a company that knows how to program will pick up the Fallout series and go back to making great games like the originals."

Now I am down loading Counter Strike in which I already installed. It takes me over an hour just to start to play a game here.

I am now going to look for Notices that say that I must register and down load the games that I have the disc for. Steam will not have me as a customer if they keep this up.

392309,1,First off I do not own this exact gamepad. I owned the previous version which had a better stick than this that one had an octagon direction thumb stick. I don't understand how they could downgrade the stick to a d pad from what was basically analog thumb arcade stick. I only paid 15 for that version and this one is 50 with a dpad. Sounds like the quality is still junk grade as the gamepads I had quit registering because they are prone invisible wire breaks and also buttons going out. Pdp used to be customer friendly and would allow painless exchanges you didn't need a reciept. No longer the case. Their controllers remain junk and their customer service will exchange defective gpads but you have go through a pain of a process.

224330,1,"Upon receiving this headset I followed all the instructions, including charging the headset for 3 hours before first time use. After having let it charge I paired it with my PS3, following GIOTECK's instructions, and found 2 major issues right off the bat.

1: This headset IS NOT NOISE CANCELING despite of what the packaging, and GIOTECK's website indicate. I had a neighbor over at the time I received it in the mail and asked her if she would help me test it. I sat at my desk with my PS3 and TV, while she sat opposite me across the 10ft. room. I asked her, soft spoken as she is, to speak to me while I had the headset active. She spoke just above a whisper and I could hear her clearly in the headset speaker. She clicked the mouse on the desk, across the room, and I could hear it in the headset speaker. This stunned me as I have been bothered numerous times by people who have headsets like this, which are not noise canceling, which pick up the slightest sounds in the room they are playing in such as their TV volume, their parents or siblings yelling at them, dogs barking in the next yard, and even cars driving by. On top of this, when these people use headsets like this it causes a doubling, or echoing effect when playing games. I can't hear what is being said in a game because I am hearing the dialogue and sound effects twice as it overlaps through the co-op player's headset. This EX-02 headset is NOT noise canceling with my neighbor speaking softly across the room. How am I supposed to not create an echoing effect for someone else when my TV is between my neighbor and I and not even on? If her voice comes through the headset it's guaranteed that my TV volume will be the only thing a co-op partner will hear.

2: There is also a recurring, tapping sound that comes through the headset speaker. It sounds like someone flicking a pie tin with their finger. It recurs so often, and is so loud that it causes the headset to be completely unusable.

There are some good things about the headset though. The LED lights on the unit are bright, clear, rich colors. The buttons are easy to press, and activate their functions nicely, and the interchangeable face plates are a nice touch, though difficult to change without feeling like you will void your warranty trying to pry them off. No instructions on how to change the face plates are included.

The included instruction pull out was easy to read and understand, in fact it's one of the nicer, easier to read instruction literatures that I've seen in a long time with my favorite being, ""Point barrel toward enemy"".

To sum up, this EX-02 headset by GIOTECK is an attractive, lightweight design but fails terribly in its usable quality. Many would opt to state that, ""You get what you pay for"". I would submit that if a company manufactures a faulty product at a low price of $20.00, then gets even 100,000 people to buy it, then toss it in a drawer when it doesn't function properly, that company just made $2,000,000.00 counting on those people saying, ""Well, you get what you pay for"".

Well, as is, out of the box, and brand new, this EX-02 headset for the PS3 has worse usable quality than an analog phone.

I purchased this headset so that I could pull it out of a bag, turn it on, and game it up without having to unpack a pair of headphones and connect all the cables and cords. After purchasing this headset, I find that I am still looking for a compact, easy to use, wireless, noise canceling headset, having not found the solution in the EX-02."
13305,1,"I had looked forward to this game for months.  It installed without incident.  The problem I had was the tutorial, beginning with the elevator (lesson #4).  The booklet says to ""call elevator"".  I didn't have to because the elevator was already there with its door open.  Then the instructions are to click on the control panel and select ""basement level 3"".  Clicking on the control panel did not work.  What did work was to spin wildly inside the elevator clicking on the walls and everything else until it moved.  Then I go to the very last Lesson (9) with the sniper rifle.  I could not put it down and was unable to finish the tutorial, and as a result could not play the game.  This game is loaded with bugs.  Don't take my word for it--go to eidosinteractive.com and look at the forums for Hitman.  I wasn't the only one to have trouble in the elevator."
72450,1,"Complete waist of money!! Patches only make it worse, corrupted my system files causing a reinstall of WinXP.

Fortunately I bought it used, but It is not even worth the space it takes up on my shelf.  Its not very original, entertaining, challenging and it is just kinda meh, boring."

106176,1,"The game idea is a lot of fun. However, the game itself crashes back to the desktop sporadically. Very frustrating. I'm running it on a 2.5 GHz desktop with Vista, a GeForce 8300 GS graphics card, dual-core processor, etc. Fast computer handles Sims2 and ALL the expansion packs, Zoo Tycoon latest versions, Roller Coaster Tycoon, all expansions. No problems with any of these, but this Valusoft game won't work properly!
Healing the animals is fun, building up your ""estate"" is fun. But the constant crashing is a pain in the rear-end.
I updated my video drivers, uninstalled and re-installed the game and it worked fine for one day. When I rebooted the computer, BOOM, it started crashing again.
My advice, save your money and stay away from valusoft games. That's what I plan to do from now on."

I am still happy I got the legacy because it's not a complete waste of money. COD4 is amazing and even better with the HD graphics. However I can't say it's worth $80 to just play COD4, but I can say I would have been absolutely infuriated if I wasted $60 on IW alone. Trash."

218041,1,I paid $10 for this and still feel like I over paid. I do have a cool looking plastic skate board with no wheels. As far as the game I've no idea what it's like. Tried multiple times at different times of the day to get this thing to calibrate. It knows when my cat skateboards on it but as far as calibrating with the game forget it. Also if you can't get it calibrated you can even forget about playing the game unless you can.

It was age appropriate and I have to admit sometimes I'll still play it and I'm 25, it was always one of my favorite games. I wanted to buy this game and looked on YouTube to see game play of Sims 4 and to my disgust, I saw cheat mods for X - rated game play!!!! I am beyond mad because children are playing this game and looking on YouTube for cheat codes and on google. Children are now exposed to the lucrative acts that are on here....... you might as well be watching porn... they show EVERYTHING! And not to mention all the different positions and settings they have on that cheat mod. It's beyond sick and I hope to God I have informed parents wanting to buy this game for their kids to STAY AWAY from it! I hope this review was helpful."

297453,1,"This launched with some issues and EA/Dice fixed a few, didn't fix some and broke others. Latest update made it unplayable to me. If you have a Nvidia SLi setup textures will flicker to the point that it will make you sick. Sound goes out a lot, which has been an issue since launch. I don't suggest this game to anyone. Maybe in a few months when they get their crap together and fix it, it might be a great game. I'm waiting to play."
355754,1,"Don't get me wrong, the game is superb, amazing, I'm satisfied. I got it from buying GTX 980 bundled. It's NOT FREE. I paid for it. There is no such thing as a free lunch, somehow somewhere somebody is paying for it for something they want from it. If Ubi don't make a dime just giving away to the GTX 980 bundled, Ubi still get the promotion of their company. Why? even if ubisoft doesn't give it away, Jack Sparrow will let you play it at day 1 anyway.

BUT... the Uplay thing that wannabe the same as Steam is the problem. So, I highly recommend any buyers to crack it if you just focus on single player. You'll see the magic, everything else will work very smooth after you stop the Uplay. Moreover, I tried to stream it with geforce, somehow Uplay won't let me in. Other ubisoft games are ok though.

And cheaters are everywhere. There is mini games race that some people finish it in just 5 seconds as top leaderboard. That's impossible. I challenge you to do it in front of me without the help of hack or cheat code.

And now, here is the problem. The moment you send a report for support, ubisoft will NOT help you. What they will do is asking the proof of purchase and all other things as if YOU are their ENEMY. Note that the evidence that some player is cheating is recorded and provided to ubisoft. Ubisoft won't help you for making report, they will first attack you.

I recommend to buy it. BUT, with that crappy support from ubi, do NOT buy it at full price, wait for it until there is super big discount. If you still feel antsy to play it, borrow it from Jack Sparrow, and buy it later on.

Far Cry 4 is a lot different from Far Cry 3.
-You can download fan made maps for your extra games, you can make your own game with it.
-There is co-op feature that gives a very interesting moments in every game you play. However, most people play solo. Join in co-op takes you forever. I've finished the game a couple times and until today I can only successfully 2 times playing co-op in PC. It's unbelievably sad. Most of the time, it's disconnected 5 seconds. For this, Ubisoft will argue with their made up excuses of course...

Yet, just so let you know... I don't have that problem with a 64 Multiplayer Battlefield 3 & 4 by DICE. Even if the multiplayer in Battlefield series has so many problems, yet I can still play it. Up to today I have more than 1000 hrs in BF3 and BF4 each, compare to any AAA title by ubisoft games combined hours average 30 hrs per game. Ubi games Price Value is not worth 50$ imo compare to Origin give away BF3 for Free to everybody last year.

And there is no point to buy the game if the supports aren't exist.

EDIT 1:
After the patch, I can get the co-op much easier than before, it's a good try. BUT.... there is always but, why? because it's Ubisoft. The Uplay prevent me use the MSI Afterburner to check the FPS and temp of my GPU. As soon as I turn on MSI Afterburner. Far Cry 4 stops working. Forget about recording your gameplay for Youtube channel. UNLESS, you crack it. Then everything will be fine. So that means, you cannot record your multiplayer experience with the software provided by your GPU. I got Far Cry 4 because of getting the NVIDIA GTX 980. So there should be all support cooperation between Ubisoft and NVIDIA. But not at this one particular game.

Again, you call ubisoft for this issue, they just say yea yea yea, we're doing something... I doubt it will be fixed by next year. Even the game Watch Dogs graphic at the advertisement VS real graphic quality now, after long time wait wait and wait, there isn't anything from ubisoft to deliver its promise.

Don't get me wrong, I did a review on Far Cry 3, it's a lot stable than FC4. Yet it was still the same problem on Multiplayer matchmaking part of the game if you read my review. How many years was Far Cry 3 made? If ubisoft have a good intention, the multiplayer issue in FC4 should have been improved a lot than the FC3.

Still, do NOT buy it at full price. 5$-ish is the right price for this game. Why? As the comparison. Battlefield 3 was ONLY 1$ when it was fixed thoroughly by DICE, and I spent more than 1000 hours of entertainment in it, Far Cry 3 less than 50$. Maybe I should dropped the star review on FC3, don't you think?"
448001,1,It was a scam And under difference names too.
190552,1,"If you play PC games because you love the PC game experience, FORGET IT!  This game is nothing more than the consolization of the CoD franchise.  PC's are NOT consoles and games should not be moronified (i.e. dumbed down to the console players mental level).

The multiplayer sucks ass and is completely unplayable unless you've had the opportunity to play the game from the early beta stage. They advertise their console-crack-smoking game-finder crap as the end-all be-all of anti-cheat.  HAH!  As a private, I'm constantly pushed to games dominated on one side by generals, while the other is all lower-ranked enlisted.  WOW! FAIR GAME!  Add to that the constant server-glitches, hackers, and cheats that supposedly ""Don't Exist"" on IWN - BAH!

Add to that the constant spawn-pwnage and sniping.  This game is no fun at all unless you are ALREADY a high ranking player (which you aren't if you are considering buying this game), or really, REALLY enjoy constantly getting spawn-raped.  I know that's what *I* asked Santa for!

As a long time CoD fan, as far as I was concerned, this franchise was close to dead after MW1, but I wanted to give it just one more chance. Foolish me.

I wasted $50 on this game so you don't have to."
261759,1,This was not the type of game I thought it would be. It is just a matching game that is redundant and I really did not like it. The only positive thing is that you can play it and completely turn off your brain for awhile.
260662,1,"... I simply play it all the way to the last mission and ... then I don't finish it and go play Assassin's Creed instead.

406120,1,"Im a casual gamer, Im a 40+ year old who stated playing console games with an Atari 2400. I still enjoy playing and Ive easily logged hundreds hours playing my favorite games.  Over the decades, Ive learned to be weary of new games. Ive gotten burned before with games that aren't fun for a variety of reasons. My rule is to rent it first and decide if I liked it.

I broke my rule for Dark Souls III and purchased it. The story seems engaging and the graphics/music/atmosphere are really excellent.  You meet the first boss battle within 5-10 minutes of playing. It took several hours for me to beat the first boss. I realize that I just need to get good, but that isn't what Im interested in.  A game has to strike a balance in order to provide entertainment to a large audience.  The game fails in that department, every review quickly glazes over the it is hard part and spends most of the time heaping praise on the graphics, sound, etc. A fair review would need to state that realistically about 90% of players will not be willing to devote the time required to develop the skill necessary to even enjoy the story.  My idea of fun doesnt involve hours of tedious failure followed by brief feeling of accomplishment/relief only to be followed by hours of tedious failure.

If the goal of this game was to create the ultimate test of battle skill, then it succeeded. The 10% of players who can master this level of control and finesse will enjoy it. Speaking as a member of the unskilled masses, this game delivers so little fun that is hard to justify playing it."

134677,1,"I have gone through 3 of these official Dualshock 3 controllers and they always wear out and break.  The analog sticks get stuck, the plastic wears down creating lots of plastic dust that gets inside and messes up the controllers, the buttons go haywire and randomly press.  I have tried to fix all 3 controllers because I'm tired of spending so much money on them and haven't had any success.  I have been a professional electronics technician for nearly 20 years and can tell you that Sony designs them with flaws intentionally in order to sell you replacements down the road at a nice profit.  This is the exact reason I won't purchase a PS4, their controllers started having issues right out of the box."
55467,1,"...but I don't like this game at all. I'm a big Zelda fan and loved all the GBC, N64, GBA and GameCube games, but because of my age, I had never played the ""classic"" Zelda games. So I picked this up, aiming to be a full-blown Zelda aficionado.

Yet within a few minutes of play, I realized that the game was far too primitive for someone reared in the era of Link's Awakening DX and Ocarina of Time. There are no NPCs to talk to, no exploration to be done, none of anything that I had come to expect from the series. I am well aware that I was probably expecting too much, but whether that's true or not, I was disappointed.

Although I didn't find anything to enjoy in this game, I'm not saying that it's bad. I'm sure that it was a classic of its era, and those who grew up with NES games will probably fall in love with it all over again. But from the perspective of someone who relies only on what she has read and heard for info on this bygone time, it simply seems like a bland, watered-down hack 'n slasher."
424738,1,Garbage. One of the analog sticks came in the mail with a small cut so that basically means you can't use this on TWO controllers. Instantly returned it.
169323,1,There is a long complicated install which requires that you load software other than the game.  The game performs very poorly on my PC and many other PCs from what I read.  There is also an oppressive DRM.  Avoid this like the plague.

337987,1,"One of the few games I've ever purchased that I just couldn't finish.  And I gave this at least a few days worth of effort before giving up.  I think one of the biggest annoyances was the lack of variation in enemies.  It seemed to take forever to reach a new type of enemy, and then they'd just be some small variation on everyone I was already fighting.  A little bit faster, a little more health.

I never felt driven by the story.  In fact, now that it's been a year or so, I don't even remember what it was anymore.  But I remember at the time, just not caring that much.  I could possess rats, though...and that's about all that really stood out as cool to me.

Another annoying part for me is that you never speak in the game.  Everyone else does, but you're totally silent, which makes you feel like you're more watching than playing the game.  But then again, that was brilliantly pulled off in Half Life.  In any event, it stood out to me, and the game environment just feels tortuously sterile, partly because of that."
164962,1,"I was extremely excited when this game first came out, but man did everything go wrong. It turned out that I needed to install about 15 GB of info from online. Why wasn't it on discs? And through Steam? Ridiculous. I never even got to play it because my computer wouldn't be able to take it, and neither would I. The WORST part is that I couldn't return it once opened. It enraged me so much that I just threw the whole $50 game with a used activation code for a Steam account in the trash. I just want the Creative Assembly to see how negative the reviews on places like Amazon are so they know what we don't want- outrageous copy protection. Now CA will get NO money and angry customers. Smart investment, guys. I have deep fears for Shogun II Total War in 2011. If it turns out like this, we can all safely boycott anything else by CA, or any other protection mad company, forever."
147322,1,I must've drew a few hundred circles in the sky for the sun to come out at Kamiki village and it never worked. The little bug voice got annoying even after my circles became perfection. Still no sun??? I can only rate this game 1 star. It was interesting until I got to the dead zone. I guess the people who gave it 5 stars never made it pass the freaking circle stage. Hate it.

453584,1,"I'm sure this game is fairly good.  That said, I need to issue a notice and warning to all potential future buyers of this product.

It is not by fault of any seller really.  It seems to be with the game publisher and manufacturer.  Ubisoft is not known for customer support as they don't really believe in it.  Quality control for most if not all of their products seem non-existant.

Do a thorough internet search and you'll get a feel that about 25-35% of people cannot install this game due to faulty manufacturig processes.  So be warned."
390647,1,"Love the game BUT if you spend the money for the Anniversary Edition be aware that while you get your stubs, when you go to redeem your 15 packs that you paid the extra 10 bucks for, you get an UKNOWN ITEM error.  Just got the game and installed it last night.  Reading message boards I see it's been around for weeks (this bug).  So I would advise if you are looking for the packs to not bother.  Wood grain case is nice, as are the themes, but not getting something you pay extra for, and evidentially something they don't care to fix is bothersome.  I won't return it in the vain hopes they will fix the problem soon, but I guess for the makers of the show, ripping off the whales is a game in and of itself.

All that said I love the game.  Great graphics and just great fun.  Just buy the regular version and you'll be happy.

Before anyone replies and tells me how I have to redeem the packs in the store, I know all that, it just doesn't work.

This review would have been six stars if that was possible if not for the developer con/rip-off/scam.  We want what we paid for, that isn't a lot to ask."

412021,1,"This could of been a good game if they fixed the terrible controls and other stupid things that were so grossly overlooked.  There's really no excuse for a AAA game to have these problems.  This game has motion control aiming active the entire time.  It doesn't need motion controls to aim, you aim just fine without them however you can't turn them off, there isn't even an options menu.  So when tilt your controller a bit your aim gets off, fun times.  A lot of audio is fed through the Wii U gamepad, pretty much all coms talk between the characters.  I have 5.1 surround sound and they're forcing me to listen through the crappy gamepad speaker?  Really a terrible, ill thought out design.  Again no option to change it.  Sorry if this sounds pretentious but I have a big screen TV too, however the game forces me to play parts in the tiny little Wii U gamepad that looks like crap by comparison.  No option menu to undo that.  The game also has a section where you're in a walker type craft that unlike every other 3rd person game on foot, you can not strafe left and right.  You can only walk forward and back with the left stick, and the right stick looks left and right.  Terrible controls again, thanks developers... The thing that upsets me most is how simple fixing these things would be.  They could turn this from a 1 star game to a 4 or 5 star game with a simple patch but I know they wont.  After playing this game I've sold my Wii U and the game.  I'm done.

Star Fox Guard is a joke maybe a 2 year old would enjoy.  Don't bother."

This is not my idea of fun! Don't waste your money on this crap. All you do is run around looking for things to help you move on. You get pathetic weapons with very limited ammo, then you fight enemies that are very hard to kill (you unload almost your entire clip just to kill one lousy zombie). RE3 is alot better than this one - at least Jill knows how to dodge. If you still wanna try this game, don't pay more than 5 bucks!"

As such I was not able to get this game working so I was refunded by Amazon. I'm not sure why its still being sold if it will not work on the pcs it is said to work on. I also want to note that even though the game I had received was new, in plastic, it did not contain any manual nor instruction booklet.

212463,1,"I put the game into my ps3 and it started by downloading a patch.  OK.  I got my Logitech GT wheel ready to go but to my utter dissappointment (and disgust), it did not work with this game.  I have half a dozen driving games (like burnout, grid, gt5, dirt 3, etc) and every one of  them works with the wheel.  I cannot even imagine playing a driving game using the ps3 wireless controller.  Well, on this game, I had to use the controller just to see the beautiful city of San Francisco (and I tell you, the wide open city is just breathtaking in this game).  The problem is you can't control the car using a joystick!!!  Anybody who says you don't need the wheel for this game has never used the wheel and thus, they don't know what they're talking about.  Without the GT Wheel support, this game is a lousy game.  Forget all the beautiful scenery...You can't drive with a joystick, period.
It is a terrible omission on the part of the makers of this game.  There is absolutely no excuse for it.  What was that patch the game downloaded?  Another car????  How about a patch to make this game GT Wheel friendly?  None of the 5 star reviews ever mentions the <no wheel support>  Are you out of your freaking minds?
You don't even know what you're missing without the wheel.  You mean you can all drive/race with the joystick, turn corners and such?

Imagine if you will, you're in Twilight Zone; you got a joystick instead of the steering wheel in your real car, and you're driving to work...You are all over the road, smashing into things, including people walking on the sidewalk; nothing is safe from the menace that you are (with your joystick from hell).  Well, the Twilight Zone it is, when I play this game without my steering wheel.  Simply unacceptable!  Grade: F"
105289,1,"I bought this for like 8 bucks used at GameStop and I brought it home and played it. As soon as I started playing it I realized it sucks. It is no fun, do not buy this or rent this. I returned it and got Lair. Which is better."

Even on the packaging, the 3DS XL is NOT LISTED as one of the systems this case supports!

86944,1,"I had heard from a friend recently about Sonic the hedgehog (Sonic 06) and how bad it was. I haven't played a Sonic game since Sonic Adventure, and I grew up with the original series on the Sega Genesis. In fact, Sonic 2 was one of the first games I owned...so I had fond memories of this series, although I had been oblivious to the development of more recent titles.

I couldn't believe that it could be THAT bad, so I ended up purchasing a copy for 5 dollars at a local swap meet to sate my curiosity. This would turn out to be the worst 5 dollars I ever spent. After playing the game for about four hours, I couldn't take any more. Rather than continue playing it, I turned to youtube to watch and see if the ending was any better...as I simply did not want to play any more of it myself.

From a gameplay perspective, Sonic team truly botched this attempt. The camera is horrible, and controlling Sonic has never felt more sickening. Sonic can no longer rev up for a speed boost, and his movements feel jittery. Because of poor control, dying is common and frustrating because of the game's absolutely absurd loading times. I would predict about 10% of this game's length could be entirely loading screens...no joke.

The presentation is equally horrid. There's a lot of bad level design here, as even the hub worlds are way too big and difficult to navigate. Sonic and his friends are all here, poorly rendered and animated. Disturbingly, Sonic team decided to place these odd, furry, mascots alongside realistic looking human beings. If that weren't bad enough, Sonic even has a ""romantic"" relationship with one of these humans. The contrast here is jarring, and somewhat disturbing.

The story is absolutely insipid and the entire thing feels like bad fan fiction. The only fortunate thing is that the ending, which I looked up online, completely retcons the entirety of the game as if Sonic team knew before the game was complete that they wanted this to be forgotten.

In summation: Obnoxious controls, extremely long load times, a poor save feature that can make you lose lots of progress, bad level design, horrible presentation, awful story, and a literally forgettable ending...

Yeah...this game is horrible. One of the worst games ever. Period. If you were a fan of Sonic in the old days, this game will only destroy your fondness for the franchise.

I've been told games like Sonic Generations are better. Stay far away from this game, though."
435224,1,"OMG don't bother.  Nothing has been updated from the PS3 version.  You still have to stand still to attack (which I had sadly forgotten).  If you can get past the terrible controls you MIGHT enjoy playing this again.  I couldn't get past it so there's $30 wasted (bought two, one for me and one for a friend so we could play together)."
75582,1,"Because Microsoft apparently hired the dumbest people on earth to create their xbox live account system, and man the online support phone numbers for it, I've got to rate this a 1.  If I could go negative I would.

I purchased an xbox 360 2 weeks ago, and got it hooked up.  But there are some HUGE gotchas, amoung which is the customer support manned by people under the age of 20 it seems, cannot actually do anything, nor does Microsoft care that they would piss off an lose a customer for life and have an xbox returned rather than give someone the ability to fix a mangled account.

So my gamer tag and xbox live account are fine.. I can log in and use them.

But....

To redeem microsoft points, xbox live subscriptions or other codes, and to use the messenger service, you MUST be able to log into your windows live.com account.
But I bought an Xbox 360.... what does that have to do with windows live, you may ask.  Indeed, good question.

Msft, on your behalf, creates a windows live account for you when you set up your xbox 360.
EVERYTHING gets associated to that account.  Yes, you only want to play video games, but you will be forced to live with a windows live account.

Ok, so beyond signing me up for something I don't want .... what the problem?

Well, they ask you for a bunch of information that is none of their business and not anything they should have for you to operate your xbox 360 console and xbox live account:
They want things like date of birth, physical address, phone number, credit card info.  None of that they need and none of it they have from me.

But, and this is where it gets tricky, they have 3 or more ways of accessing an account password reset : either through xbox live.com, windows live.com, a phone call to xbox live support, etc, etc.
And they all require that you provide a date of birth.  It matters not that you have your name, gamer tag, and the secret question answer you set up (3 things that should be enough).  Nope, they require you provide information they have no business having.  So if you don't remember what fake birthdate you gave them, you maybe screwed.

I can only recommend you don't bother with XBox Live and Microsoft Points at all.  The xbox 360 may be a decent console, but the whole live/points infrastructure and idiotic management is beyond incompetent in design and quality of customer support.  It makes the horrid Dell customer support system look good by comparison."

Then, my new pc had an issue and the techs told me that I needed to refresh my system. Not an issue as I could surely re-load this. Yeah, right.

I was able to get my pc up and running and decided to reload Homefront. When I put in the purchase code, I received a ""Duplicate Record Error"" and it suggested I contact Steam. I did contact them. This proved to be nothing more than a lesson in patience. Their customer service and support is simply a series of emails. You do not talk to anyone. I sent them all the data I had about the purchase from Amazon. This was fruitless.

As a result, I simply gave up. Steam's support is simply designed to frustrate the user until they simply give up. That was my take-away from all of this. As a result, and I told them this when THEY closed my ticket out, that I would N-E-V-E-R purchase another Steam product again no matter what. It is not worth the aggravation. No offense to Amazon's Customer Support but they were of no real help either.

I liked the game. It had moment that were very intense and again, the story line was excellent. But! The support from Steam was anything but supportive. As a result, I would warn you NOT TO PURCHASE STEAM PRODUCTS AS THEY DO NOT SUPPORT WHAT THEY SELL. If I could give this 1/2 of a star, I would. Not for the game, but for the support or lack thereof."

203762,1,"I'll cut right to the chase, this game is a bore.  It is utterly visually stunning, but aside from that, it's a total bore to play.
I know, you're thinking ""But it's ROCKSTAR games! They made those awesome GTA games I love so much!"" - Let me clear this up: not everything Rockstar makes is a gem.  Not everything they make plays like GTA.  It may LOOK like it should, but that doesn't mean it does or will.
This game looks AMAZING: the people's faces and the environment is easily the most-detailed to date.  BUT: You can't do SQUAT.  Oh look at that amazingly huge city!  Wouldn't it be nice to explore it?  Sure - go explore.  But just don't touch or open or interact or DO anything.  All you can do, is stick to the ""Script"" - you go here, look around in a confined area, talk to some people, that's it.  Repeat that over and over.  It's boring.
All you do - well, 90% of what you do, is sit and ask people questions and try to determine if they're lying or not.  It LOOKS cool, but the novelty wears off quickly.  It also doesn't matter in the least if you choose right or wrong during the interviews (you can choose if someone is telling the truth, if you have ""doubt"", or if they are lying): You just continue on with the game.  Next interview.  It's shamefully dull.
There are some minor chase scenes or action bits - but too far and few if you ask me.  The fact that this game is so gorgeous but that you can actually DO so little is mind-numbingly annoying.
Not to mention - this game is THREE (3) discs!!!  Have you ever heard of that before?  I haven't had to switch discs on something since my old Commodore 128 days!!  (Yeah we had the 128, not the 64).

138930,1,"THIS IS A COMMENTARY ON ALL THE 1-STAR REVIEWS I HAVE READ ON THIS WEB SITE

If you agree with the below, feel free to copy/paste on other sites/boards.

Personally, I said ""take a hike, Blizzard"" by not buying Diablo 3. As a matter of fact, having been burnt by the horrible game of Star Wars: The Old Republic, I did not even buy Mass Effect 3 (I read gamers' reviews first and it turns out not buying it was a good decision) and, most certainly, I will never preorder ANY game (no matter how much I want to preorder X-COM: Enemy Unknown).

Over the last 5 years or so, game publishers have repeatedly lied to us, created incredible hype around their products, raised their prices to unbelievable, unprecedented levels and sold us TRASH... and WE bought said trash. It is time we all learned our lessons and collectively started doing a few things:

- Deliberately ignore all game advertisements as well as all pre-launch statements, comments, promises and previews by game developers or their puppets such as GameSpot (would GameSpot give D3 a bad preview/review when D3 ads paid by Activision/Blizzard are all over the GS site?);

- Never pre-order anything, ever; Just don't. Ever;

- Never buy ANY game until a couple of months have passed since launch date. Why? Not only because there may be some foolish, nave, trusting romantics who buy and review it before you but also because if no-one rushes to pay $70-80 for their (potentially trash) games, then in two months' time the price (in view of low demand) will have to drop to more reasonable levels of $40-50 or even less.

If we do this enough game publishers will have to change their unethical practices.

Video gaming (and especially computer gaming as opposed to console gaming) used to be a true art form and the games stimulated your mind and spirit.

The games of the last half decade have grown increasingly dumbed-down, streamlined, simplified, trivialized; they have turned into mainstream Hollywood assembly line of mass-produced garbage. Most of these games stimulate nothing but your mousing or button-mashing fingers and in the process insult your intelligence.

It is time to say to game publishers:

- We want OUR gaming back;
- You will not tell us what's good and force it down our throats until we like it;
- We will buy what we want and we refuse to buy what we DON'T want no matter how much YOU think we should like it;

It is time the gaming community stood up to the tyranny of Activisions, EAs and the like.

If you agree with the above, feel free to copy/paste on other sites/boards."
276187,1,"Save your money and go get world of Warcraft. The game is buggy, laggy and has almost no support. It isn't worth the time or money in my opinion,"
264142,1,"This game desperately wants to be like Tactics Ogre, and Final Fantasy Tactics (two games I adore), but fails miserably.  The mechanics of this game are so bad I don't even know where to begin.

The developers thought they'd do something ""new"" and have it time-based, similar to Tactics Ogre, but it doesn't work at all.  For every one move you make, the enemy gets about six turns.  It's totally unbalanced.

Your characters can either be killed, or they retreat, which isn't bad, but the developers decided to make you LOSE YOUR ITEMS unless you decide to waste a turn and pick them back up.  You can lose anything including your WEAPON and ARMOR.  Does upgrading a weapon and then losing it, only to have to buy it again sound fun?  This happens constantly, to the point where I just rage quit.

Levels are meaningless and just give you a marginal health gain and the capacity to carry more weight.  Part of what makes SRPG's fun is training your units and leveling them up, making them stronger.  This game doesn't have that, and it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it.

Aside from that, there's way too much dialogue, bad camera angles, and the battles frequently get interrupted by a screen that transitions to the next day, something that's totally pointless and annoying, and it disrupts the flow of the game completely."

Not really so because the slightest touch on the right button activates it and regardless of what you have it set to do, reload your weapon, throw a grenade, etc., it stops the primary action and does the secondary, and, as the primary action is almost always (the left button) really urgent like shooting something, guess what ... yup ... you got it ... you stop shooting and activate the secondary action, and if your opponent is any good you are dead.

349546,1,"The game is terrific until you reach one of the game breaking glitches with which the game abounds. By game breaking I mean you can't progress in the story at all. There are several of them that have been reported and I've just experienced one of them for the second time. The A new direction quest glitches (not all the time) where you can't turn in the quest. You can't proceed and you're basically stuck until its fixed. There was a similar bug in the original BL, and they never fixed it and I've got no expectation they'll fix this one. So if it happens you'll have spent maybe 10-15 hours in the game and be completely stuck. For those of you considering buying this piece of quality control reject then google the game breaking glitches that have already been reported...and by the way as of the date of this review they haven't fixed a blasted one of them."
451306,1,"This was one game that I remotely enjoyed in the arcade, but unfortunately what made the game worth its while was the gun. The gun was the whole attraction of the game, which was otherwise just a dull shoot-em-up.
But my question is why? Why repackage a game that was clearly marked for the Arcades with the extra guns and what-not. Yes, Playstation has had some success in repackaging some of the arcade games for play at home, and yes thay have made great games with shooter attributes without the gun, but if they were to re-package a shooter game where people have gotten used to using a gun in the arcade for Playstation-2, they should (and could) have gave us some sort of a gun for just a few dollars extra and at least made it worth its while."
162211,1,"This game is just depressingly bad. The entire game is built around an auction house that to the very core is featureless and hard to use. You are limited to 3 filters on an item search. You cannot filter by those search filters. You cannot filter by bid value or duration left.

The game is designed around a cookie cutter for total morons.

Basically Blizzard tells you how to play the game every step of the way. How to build your character. What stats you should gear for, what skills to use, etc.

They have consistently let exploiters go unpunished, while at the same time nerfing legitimate player builds citing that they are too powerful.

The economy is so inflated due to only being able to post 10 items every 3 days on the auction house. THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL DESIGN. Blizzard wants to encourage people not to play their game legitimately rather than spend their money in the RMAH buying items.

The final difficulty mode (Inferno) is designed so that players brick wall upon entering every new act. This too is done to intentionally force players to visit the auction house (RMAH or otherwise, it is impossible to collect the gear necessary to advance.)

Overall, a low quality game. I give it 1/5 stars."

If they even have the guts to make another game, I doubt I'll buy it."
287146,1,"UPDATE! see the bottom of this review

I'd like to start by stating my brief history with headsets. I've only really ever experienced TurtleBeach headsets, but with music I have used Bose. I owned Bose, the x11's, and the XP300's for a few months. I love the Bose and 11's, hated the 300's because they felt like my head was being squeezed even after trying to loosen them, and like the 510's. For 15 days before I bought the 500's and tried them but the interference was awful, plus they didn't have built in rechargeable batteries.

I contacted turtle beach about how tight the 300's were and they said this was by design, so I was reluctant to try the 510's. I haven't experienced the same problem however so I kept them. I have experienced two other issues that you should consider before buying these and TB should not be proud of.

Issue 1) Auto Shut-off: These headsets turn off if the source of audio is ""too quiet"". I have these hooked up to my computer via creative's DDL with optical link and blue-tooth. With this sound card any digital hook-up has zero volume control. Instead it sends sound out at one volume that cannot be adjusted, which in my case happens to mean that my music on media player must be set at 10% or higher to keep the audio level ""above the threshold"" for the auto-shut off timer. This is a problem because sometimes my games don't play sound above that threshold, which means I need to keep media player in the background just to keep the headset on. Which is distracting, and no one should ever have to make such compromises on such an expensive piece of equipment. The auto-shut off is non-programmable.

Issue 2) Audio: if you plan on using these for computer, when you're not actively listening to something, the digital processor at the transmitter turns off IMMEDIATELY, and takes seconds to turn back on. This translates to: the first few seconds of any song you play, or any game, audio test, ANYTHING is cut-off because the transmitter simply isn't on. To fix this I must keep music playing in the background at 10% at ALL times if I don't want to experience this. This headset wasn't expressly made for pc, but TB had to know that a $300 headset wouldn't sit at one console in its life cycle.

Remember that to use these for computer you will need something with DDL, and a blue-tooth adapter on the pc.

Programmability: Now on to the rest of the review, the reason I bought this headset was for the programmable microphone. See I play at night on the Xbox a lot, so I have to whisper. Almost all headsets don't pick up on whispers though, so I hoped these could be programmed to. They are, but it's not simple at first glance. Specifically you must turn up not the XBL and BT output volume or even the silencer threshold, but for XBL and even computer games to pick up on your voice you need to boost the equalizer. When you do this you will be able to whisper now. 5 stars

As for the rest of the programming options, I haven't got into that because it's complex and from the looks of it you can do almost anything you want. Very promising potential to adjust it exactly the way you want. N/A stars

Comfort: they don't hurt, unlike the 300's. I have worn them for hours on end without issue. 4 stars

Audio: I'm no audiophile so I can't say much. They work, and do have bass. They seem fine. 4  stars

Blue-tooth: this works on my phone, on my computer, google voice, and so on. Seems to work like a blue-tooth should.  Everything I've tried works and without interference. 5 stars

Wireless: I personally don't experience much issue with the interference on these headphones. Sure occasionally I get static or something here and there but it's never been an issue and some of it is to be expected. I have noticed that it does work better when the left ear cup is closer to the transmitter. 4  stars

Transmitter: I like the stand for the headset, but Issue 2 is a problem for me. I wish there was still a headphone jack for friends. For issue 2 I give it 2 stars, because I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to keep it working right.

Microphone: It's programmable in any way you want, what's not to like? 5 stars

XBL adapter: it works without issue so far, sometimes I accidently bump the button on it with my belly while gaming so watch out for that. 4  stars

Charging cable: it's long and it works, but you can feel it pointing down on your shoulder. Makes me worried that I might wear the connection port out one day from this, 4  stars

Data Cable: it's a little too short, you'll need a laptop or move you xbox to your monitor to use this. 3 stars

Surround Sound: it's not breath taking, but it's nice. Honestly I didn't fiddle with this too much and feel that it could be better. But again, I didn't play with the settings on this speaker positioning enough on this to give it a fair review. So I'll just go with 4 stars for now

Overall I'm happy with the headset. I didn't experience issue 1 while on the Xbox. I haven't used it on the PS3 yet, save for Netflix. While browsing on Netflix the auto-off did kick in, and it's F annoying. However during console gaming and actual streaming I had no issue myself.  I would buy these again, but if someone made the same thing without issue 1 I wouldn't.

sorry for the long review

UPDATE: 6/1/2014

It turns out, these aren't worth it. I'm playing Hitman: Blood Money on the 360 with all the game sounds set to %100 and the power saving feature keeps turning my headset off, so I have to leave my wireless headset plugged into it's charger just so they stay turned on. so everything I said before about it being decent is now debunked because it won't stay on. Turtle Beach screwed up, anyone who tried this for an hour on a handful of games could have quickly spotted this before releasing the product. The device is properly setup, i am 100% sure it is not an error on my end.

update: 7/26/2015
just wanted to add that i recently tried the elite 800's, and for the money it's a terrible buy. turtlebeach is now on my blacklist and i suggest you never buy without a return policy in mind. then when you do, if it even slightly bothers you or something you don't return it without question. they seem to be develiping a trend of products that have alot of flaws that any ordinary person would hate for the price."
235213,1,"This game is absolutely horrible, they spent 15 years making the game, it did not live up to all the hype. They over advertised this game. The 2D versions were much better than this game. This game had cheesy lines, crappy weapons, boring levels, it was repetitive. Stay away from buying this."
262450,1,"The game itself is not that bad to me. However, it is not worth the exceedingly long download, upload, and update times. I am not a buisnes professional in the least. But even I think it makes good buisnes sense to take those things into concideration before releasing a game to the public. Also the site you register the game at has fees for using characters after a limited amount of time and if you don't use your account after a year. I appreciate the fact they have no inital monthly fee. But if they are going to make you pay to use your own character, they should count that as a monthly (daily, weekly, hourly, ect.) fee. And they should state there will be such fees before you take on the long download time of this game. I think your time would be better spent on xbox (xbox 360, wii, Nintendo, Playstation) games that carry the Final Fantasy games. They are also fun, have no added fees, and cost nothing to play once the purchase price is paid. I am sorry to say that #14 still needs work and you might want to wait until they get all the buisness and technical bugs out of it before buying it. Perhaps it will fair better if they ever release it on another format (xbox 360 or NintendoDS for example). I would not recomend wasting time or money with the PC version though."

457915,1,"I'm starting to think this is the most laughable excuse for a video game system yet.  The Game Gear was pretty shoddy, the Jaguar was downright detestable.  But here's... THIS... for only a couple of c-notes, you get this amazing system, that's like a broken swiss army knife that has hundreds of different tools but seems to randomly burst open at inopportune times in your hand causing severe injury.  Yeah, it plays MP3'S, but buying this brings you already two-thirds of the way to the best MP3 player on the market.  Yeah, it's a cellphone, but there's so many more elegantly designed units that don't require you using a headjack to not look like a moron.  Yeah... erm, it plays games.  Erm, some games.  A-a few.  OK, they're ports of first-gen Playstation titles for the most part, and while that isn't wrong in itself (70% of the GBA's library is made of SNES ports or adaptations), it's all in the execution, and with poor control and the lousy aspect ratio, it's already gone belly up, not to mention these blocky 3D graphics are so much more painful on the eyes than something like, say, the nice smooth sprites of an Advance Wars.  And there are about 15 games in total, out of which only 2 or 3 are any good, and even then the fatal system flaws lead to them being well nigh unplayable.  Multiplayer is wireless and adequately implemented, but that's about the only plus, and there's only a couple of titles taking advantage of that, too.  After such a stupendous release as the GBA SP (perfection in design if there ever was any), such horrible design is inexcusable.  I know this is practically flogging a dead horse, but the message must be made loud and clear, lest a huge number of children become disappointed come Christmas.  Please, just say no.  Buy a GBA SP for half the price and get your kid a cellphone to accompany it with the remaining money (see, there's two of the functions the N-Gage has already!).  It's time that companies like this taking advantage of heedless customers with shoddy merchandise be stopped.  Disengage the N-Gage."

191447,1,"I have played plenty of rpg and plenty of bethesda and this game frankly sucks i got lucky and picked this and fallout 3 up for cheap(used copies) and it still feels unworth it and here is why
Game play
This game plays just like fallout 3 but sloppier and besides they both feel like sloppy versions of the elder scrolls series and so i cant approve
Graphics
The graphics at first seem better then 3 but soon the glitchs start and you see otherwise
Plot
Thus felt so weak and reused the whole you get revived from being shot by a mob boss controlling a faction in post america is just simply predictable
Conclusion
If you have never played an rpg and want a cheap intro into how they work then get fallout 3 not this and experianced rpg players like me better just look the other way zero worth to this awful game"

230954,1,"I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years now and this game looked like it would be fun but apparently I got a defective cable.  I tried 3 different guitars and all 5 USB ports on my new Xbox 360 Slim ... not a sound and the game keep telling me to turn up the volume on my guitar which after a few minutes got really annoying especially after I plugged them into my Marshall amp and got sound.

Overall, really disappointed and getting a refund ... think I'll just stick to Guitar Pro & backing tracks ... big waste of time!"
148563,1,"Now before i start i want to say i loved Gears of War 1. With that out of the way, Gears of War 2 is a complete disaster. From the moment i popped it into my 360 Elite to when i popped it back out after a couple hours of campaign and a few games of multiplayer. I already sold it back to GameStop. Epic should change their company name to Epic Fail because they sure did drop the ball on this game.

Where do i even start? I guess i'll start with the campaign. It's decent, just a Gears of War 1 rehash, nothing more. Definitely forgettable. The dialogue is completely childish and immature this time around throughout the entire game. Dom does nothing but [...] all game, it gets really old after about the first mission. It just feels so clunky and thrown off.

Now onto my favorite mode and what kills the game for me, Multiplayer. What the heck was Cliffy B smoking when he made this game? The multiplayer is a sheer disaster. Instead of being able to chose what type of game mode you want to play you have to vote now. You can't even choose your team. It's like Halo 3 gone wrong. It's just bad. The shotgun, which was the best weapon and most fun in Gears of War 1 has been completely dumbed down and is now one of the weakest weapons in the game. This game caters to all the Gears of War 1 cry babies that sucked at the game. If you were a lancer noob from Gears of War 1 this game will probably be right down your alley.

1/5 stars, would of gave it zero if i could. Don't buy this game, don't even rent it. Save your money, Gears 2 is just a rehash of the first game that hasn't improved at all. Buy Resistance 2 for the Ps3, it's the best shooter this generation and the best i've ever played. R2 is easily Game of The Year"

129046,1,"For a while, I was torn between purchasing Operation Darkness or this game, Spectral Force 3.  Both are strategy RPGs, and both are by Atlus.  I decided on Operation Darkness, and it was surprising fun.  So Spectral Force seemed like a no-brainer.  At first glance, it looked a lot like the wonderful Shining Force series of games.  Even the name seemed to tie in to the old series.  But beyond that, this game is no Shining Force.

Problem:  The control scheme is very counter-intuitive.  It's simple enough to move about the game terrain, but the attack setup is murky at best.  There are different strength attacks, depending on what button you push.  Of course, the game doesn't explain that, and the game book is similarly useless.

Another problem:  The enemies appear in stages and not all at once.  That works fine for Operation Darkness, because the maps are huge.  Not so much in this game.  You kill three enemies, and suddenly, there are three more standing behind you.  It's hard to coordinate attacks when you cannot anticipate the enemies' location.

Another problem:  The hub you return to after missions gives you practically no information, or hints about creating items and armors.  You find random junk during battles and you can create new gear after the fact.  But what will the new armors and weapons do?  Are you making something really powerful, or is it just more useless stuff? The game doesn't really tell you.

Another problem.  Let me get this straight . . . the healer in your party cannot heal himself outright?  You have to acquire a spell after the fact?  He has no problem healing the other party members, so why can't he heal himself?  That didn't make any sense, and it makes even less sense after the character dies constantly.

Final problem: In between missions, there are static cut scenes with dialogue, moving the story forward.  This is where the game likes to freeze.  Now an occasional freeze is forgivable, but not when it occurs on a consistent basis.  You beat the mission, watch the cutscene, the game freezes, you cannot save, start over.  That's unforgivable.

Forget this game."
387551,1,"They are totally amazing and completely work, in other words THEY DONT EVEN WORK. Not even worth the money to ship them back for them to send me another piece of plastic that won't work"
132728,1,"Install went okay...

Click to play, configuration tool crashes over and over - BAD.

/figure out a way around configuration tool by starting the game through a 2ndary launcher inbeded in the program files. /successfully launched skipping the configuration tool.

So that was frustrating.

Gameplay - BAD

First issue, Crashes caused by conversations with npcs, which occurred from the start of the game and plagued it until the end, when it first happen windows gave a solution of a Mass Effect 1 Patch - which was easy enough to download and install but DIDN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE...  Its completely RANDOM when it happens sometimes a npc will trigger it, sometimes not.  LOL it literally says ""file not found"" and crashes, restart and Presto it works VERY RANDOM but must of restarted me 12+ times.  SAVE before EACH and Every NPC you talk to - to limit annoyance.

Cover system made of fail - pulls you into cover just by walking next to something awkward, and bad angles.

Item Cap of 150 /fail *blinks* if your already allowing me to carry around 100+items why the heck is there a cap at all?  And sorting the inventory out was a pain.  Games in general need to stop adding Caps like this, FF7 was great and you could hold 99 of everything.

Actual fighting/gameplay a form of torture clunky, clunky, CLUNKY - don't bother with cover its useless.

Land Rover - giggity, whoever thought it was a good idea or even fun needs ran over by it.  Its like they never took the time to explore their own maps with it, getting stuck going up a hill and falling back down IS NOT FUN.  Which brings me to another point, whoever designed their map levels needs to lay off the obsessive amount of mountains on EVERY planet.  It was INCREDIBLY unfun having to explore with the rover, when it bounces around like a weightless rag-doll on every little bump and don't have enough power to climb a hill.

Elevators - HORRIBLE you'll spend alot of time just tapping your foot waiting on the obnoxiously long elevator rides THAT ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN THE GAME.......
its actually a ""thank god"" moment when you run into a short elevator ride in the game YEAH ITS THAT BAD... 3-5 minutes stuck in a elevator staring at the screen is unacceptable especially considering they are so FREQUENT.

Sniper rifle wobble - Shepard on some kind of drug?  is he/she not a trained soldier?  Why can't he hold it still?  Even when you get the ability to add 2 25% weapon stability upgrades it's shake is pretty bad...  I'll never understand what was going through their head on this one.  As a amateur hunter i don't have any issue with shaking my gun like I'm hopped up on sugar pops OR WORST...

Story - Wasn't bad.

i think i might of liked it better than Me2, at least the end bad guy wasn't a ridiculous ""HUMAN REAPER"" oh noes!  - why they would even mechanically choose such a shape just shows lack of creativity.  Which truth be told this series lacks in spades.

Generally Clunkyness of the game and crash frustrations ruin any immersion.

Take note my machine far surpasses its recommended system requirements by a tremendous length.

It did some things better than Me2

For example every star system you go to has ""something"" to do in it.  But that is cut asunder by the horrible land rover you get to explore the planets with.

No Ammo was a cool idea, only overheating.

Ability to Sell stuff for Credits - this is good, but ultimately useless as there is very little worth buying, and the 150 item cap drove me insane. - I ended with 9,999,999 (max) useless credits.

overall if i would of played this before Me2 i wouldn't of bought Me2 cus the genre would be dead to me.  Me2 is at least playable.  This is borderline unplayable, i managed to get through it by jamming to music in the background and reminding myself of the bigger picture Me2/Me3..."

191525,1,"This is the same story with Fallout 3, and it was no surprise that it was going too be the same in New Vegas. The irony of it all though, is that most of the bugs and glitches and freezing issues in Fallout 3 carry over into New Vegas. It's clear this company knows they have a faithful audience of fan boys that will regardless buy this game, even though it's a unfinished product. They will continue too keep doing this, because the game sells a lot of units at launch. And these so called ""patches"" that usually claim to fix most of the serious issues don't, so it's loss and loss situation. If you were lucky too get this game when Black Friday was around, good for you. Full price for this game? NO! NO! NO!"

229818,1,"I almost made it to the end of this game, when it crashed and corrupted my save game.  Since it autosaves I would have to play the whole thing over.  The fact the game is addictive and fun to play just makes it that much more annoying when bugs like this happen, just like they did in AC2.  Ubisoft's customer service is also terrible, and they are rude about it too.  Avoid wasting your time and money.

I did figure out a workaround, which also works in the other AC series games.  You have the find the save games file, which differs by your OS.  Google it for specifics.  Then save duplicate copies of the file periodically.  A mild pain but better than losing your saves.  You have to do it ahead of time, though."
376548,1,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this controller , I have one and it looks outstanding.. The problem is that this controller is a bestBuy exclusive, and the seller bought many of these things cheap on Black Friday and is now price gouging and charging more for them than BestBuy does when selling at normal price. Don't buy from this SNAKE and just go to BestBuy or order from them and save yourself some cash..

438775,1,"This is a really bad game on so many levels.  It is hard to give it any good marks when the bad things are consistently there year after year.  I hadn't even bothered to touch this since Madden 2012 and I thought maybe after 5 years things had improved.  WRONG.

Pros - You get to play a football game, but it could be so much better

Cons...

1.  Tiresome overly complicated menus.  EA wasted more time and energy on bogus presentation and complicated menus than they did on actual game play and real game improvements.  Play calling is horrendous now with the menus they have.

2.  Redundant pathetic coaching reactions to EVERY play get so tiresome, it takes that much longer to play the game.  I see Jim Caldwell on my screen more than my actual players and I really could care less what he thinks.

3.  Poor tackling and horrible physics.  It's sad that a game like NFL 2K (and I hate bringing this game up) is far superior at 10 years old and EA is still lagging behind and hasn't figured it out yet.  Guys look like they are drowning out there when they flop around.  Ridiculous passes and catches that are something out of a Matrix movie.

4.  Pathetic defending.  Played a guy online who couldn't move the ball against me except for his standard hail mary to Larry Fitzgerald to catch the ball in double and triple coverage, no matter what defense was selected.  Scored both his TDs this way with the epic ""aggressive catch"".  I'd really love to know how receivers in the NFL actually decide which catch they make isn't aggressive.  This was an absolute joke of an idea.

5.  Excessive fumbling.  You can breathe on a player and he'll cough the ball up after you're putting together a solid drive.

The bottom line is nothing is going to change until people hit the NFL and EA where they hurt...their wallets.  If people boycott this game and it stops selling the NFL will be forced to stop giving EA exclusive rights and some competition will be healthy for football games."
437846,1,"This is the same formula they have been using for a while. Crazy fast game play and you have to drink 5 cups of coffee just to start to be able to keep your head on enough of a swivel to not get shot from above, behind, beside, below, or through a wall. With MW2 and MW3 if I saw a group of people I would know I'm taking out 1-2 if I had the jump on them. Not on here!  Even if I have the jump there is always someone else right beside you!!  Game is way to fast and the graphics look terrible. Cartoonish!  I love COD, but have been disappointed in all of them since MW3 and BO2."

7157,1,"This game should have NEVER been released in its current state. Its load times are unacceptable. Both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation. Squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the PS1. This is an extremely bad port of FF5 and FF6. FF5 freezes very often when you try to save. Also its load times are long. Not to mention this is the original translation of the game, so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game. FF5 just butchers the English language. FF6 is the same as it was on SNES except for extremely long load times. It becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever. The long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience. Stick to the SNES or get these games on gameboy advance. Also FF5 is exactly the same on PSN as it was in anthology. LONG LONG load times as well as being incompatible with your PS3 half the time. Shame on you square soft, shame."
153534,1,I was obessed with resident evil 4 so much I bought it on three different consoles but this game made me want to scream. I paid $80 for the limited edition and ended up selling it to game stop for $20. My biggest problem was the girl who follows you around and does nothing but die and steals your ammo. They use some the same exact scene from resident evil 4 an example a truck comes right towards you and you have to kill the driver. Do they we are stupid save your money and buy resistance 1 or 2.
229981,1,"I purchased this game because my 17 year old daughter, who is fascinated with zombies for some reason and wanted the game for Christmas. This game is the standard ""mission based"" game in which you run around an island, completing tasks for people and killing a lot of zombies.

As I see it, the problems with this game are that the controls are awkward and the storyline cumbersome, and after about an hour, the game is repetitive and boring. I also didn't appreciate all the profanity with no way to turn it off in the game settings. I realize that some people talk that way, and that it might lend a certain degree of alarm to the game, but I really don't appreciate hours on end of profanity blaring through my house.

My daughter played the game for about 3 days and hasn't touched it since. She found it boring after a while too."

Upon destroying that hunk of junk, I plugged in  my regular ps2 controller and dominated opponents that had only moments before put me to shame. The joystick was so chintzy in it's design it would only pull off the command half the time. I must mention that it was nothing like an actual arcade stick, which is fluid and accurate. Imagine trying to draw a smooth circle in an octagonal plastic stencil, and that's how the stick felt. The buttons worked fine, but also felt cheap. I honestly don't know what they were thinking here. The only reason I bought the thing was for the accurate stick movement that a normal controller lacks, but shocked was I as to how much worse this handled than my normal ps2 controller. Had I returned it, it would simply be re-sold to some other poor shmuck, I could not allow that to happen in good conscience."
171449,1,"First this is an online game so it takes a very long time for you to download everything and get started playing. I was excited to see that there was going to be a change from Modern Warfare, but it really wasn't.

This claims to be a team-based type of game, don't fool yourself, it isn't. You are either good at the game or you are bad at the game, there really is not anything in between. It is hard to keep a streak going inside of the game and the maps just were not all that enjoyable.

I would have thought the game would have had more to it, but it just doesn't.

One of the biggest hates for this game is the extra content that you have to pay for. That stuff annoys me. Games like that should not exist.

*********
I was reading some of the reviews for the 1 star ratings, a lot of them are the same things. Team work doesn't exist, there is little microphone usage and the 256 players is misleading. Sounds to me like quite a few people are having this problem.

Wake up MAG fan-boys. Just cause you and some guy play the game for 5 hours religiously a night coordinate with each other doesn't mean they all are."
389442,1,SCALPER PRICE! just buy the japanese version it is a smooth $180
154002,1,"This game is beautifully done, with great graphics and very well-hidden objects.  Unfortunately, one flaw renders it unplayable under some circumstances - the mouse does not move all the way to the edge of the screen.  I'm stuck at a point where I know exactly where the object is (a hint wasted even confirmed this is, indeed, the correct object) but I cannot get the mouse to move close enough to select it.  I've clicked dozens of times all around it (and lost many minutes!) and still, it will not select the object.  Unfortunately, short of starting as a new player and hoping I don't get that particular object again (or any in a similar position), I don't see a way to overcome this issue.

Which is sad, otherwise, the game seems very nice, but it is simply too frustrating that you cannot do what you see needs to be done to progress the game.  I've tried a few times, and always run up against this issue.  I don't know how to correct it, so I'm simply uninstalling the game and hopefully forgetting about it.

*EDIT*
There is a way around the problem - someone told me the secret!  You have to start the game, then go to the main menu and uncheck 'full screen'.  Click 'okay' to resume the game (which will now be small and windowed, too small to play with how tiny some of those objects are!) and then go *back* to the main menu and re-check 'full screen'.  You will now be able to move all the way to the edges.  I'm not sure if I'd change my star rating even if I could (maybe up the 'fun' item) because that's such an annoying flaw.

So this allowed me to play through the game and the story (history) is great, the only issue... okay, two issues.  One, it's really, really short.  Two, some of those items are impossible to find and there are very few hints.  Seriously, the fireflies?!  Who could find that one...  well, I won't spoil it.  But save a hint for that!"

298819,1,"I just threw $30 away buying the highly broken, freeze-prone PC version which has NO UNINSTALLER and is simply unplayable. NBA 2k14 for PC is intolerably stupid. First, it takes an hour just to get into the game due to the new player account creation and apparently non-responsive 2K servers. Second, even after creating an account (which, I have to wonder, why that's even necessary?) it will get stuck on the login screen (after waiting 30 minutes, had to Ctrl+Alt+Del to escape and kill the process!!). Third, there is NO UNINSTALLER!!!! When you insert the disc, it immediately starts running the game. There is no uninstaller in the Program Files or in Control Panel. Un-freaking-believable. And here I thought, shoot, why not give the PC version a try instead of the Xbox for a change?

My son has played NBA 2k for the last few years and loves the game on XB360. This time around, I decided to give the PC version a try so he could enjoy his new PC, and to take a break from the XB360. BIG MISTAKE. It was an unpleasant experience from the moment the disc was inserted. Which, by the way, only works once. After you run the installer the first time, it will never, ever, ever come up again. You can only go into Control Panel to the Uninstall list, and Redo the install, there is absolutely no way to get rid of this game off your PC without manually editing the registry and deleting the files physically (which I'm averse to do). This is absolutely unacceptable.

Why did we need to uninstall it? Because it freezes up at the player login screen, no reply, no interrupt, no option to exit. Have these developers ever heard of a user interface? Do they realize that a game shouldn't just go into an endless loop when looking for a server, without allowing the user to cancel? I would venture to guess that the ""physical disc version"" is a mostly broken hack of the Steam version.

I thought this was the Steam version, was expecting a Steam code inside. Apparently there is more than one ""PC version"" of the game, as if that makes any sense. At least the Steam version would be able to uninstall the game easily and re-install it if desired. This physical disc non-Steam game is absolutely broken. Amazon owes me a Steam code and I don't know how I'm going to get rid of this off my son's PC in order to install the Steam version. This sort of experience was supposed to be the heyday of PC gaming, not 2013. I assume the Steam version can be installed/re-installed/uninstalled like any Steam game. The standalone PC version, though, is a total bust.

[EDIT 11/25/13] Amazon gave me a refund with a restocking fee applied and I have to spend about $3.00 to send it back. So I only threw away about $10.00, but it's better than $30. Will apply that toward the XB360 version."
156684,1,"I want to preface this review by stating that I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do like to play after work or when I'm bored to let off a little steam.  Unfortunately this game causes my blood pressure to skyrocket.

This game could have been so much fun - it has amazing graphics and sense of motion, but it is absolutely ruined by some of the most frustrating gameplay I have ever experienced.  Be prepared to die over and over and over and over again, even on the easiest setting.  I would suggest renting it, or downloading the demo and spare yourself the agony of playing this."

I'm SO MAD that Baraka isn't in it. At least Kung Lao is in it. I like his friendship where he throws his hat like a frisbee. Nightwolf's friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers. I like Sindel's animality. I am SO buying this game.
243405,1,"Don't believe all the hype!  Less than 3 hours into the game and I immediately traded it in, and here's why..

I have no problem with hunting a ton of different animals in order to craft items, but when you hunt a ton of animals, then you die, you lose ALL of your animal skins!  ALL OF THEM!  Now why the f*** would I want to play a game where all of my efforts have been wasted???  You gotta be out of your mind!  After dying on the battlefield, whether it's by a pirate or an animal, you should KEEP all of the hides you've hunted!  Instead, you start right back at your last saved checkpoint.  It's absolutely unbelievable, and I can't believe they didn't put any effort into designing an appropriate save feature.

Luckily, I bought this for around $15.  I also have Far Cry 4 for PS4, which I bought for $15 as well.  It's still sitting on my shelf, unwrapped.  Guess what?  I have no interest in playing that game at all.  It's being traded in as well.  Between the money-grubbing DLC that video games have these days, on top of the design flaws a la Far Cry 3, I'm definitely going to slowly be giving up console gaming really soon."

Many other games run much faster while displaying many more polygons. The game play it's self of course is nothing new. Same old Starcraft knock off.

I disliked the music, the style of the art, the premise of the story, the real-time dual-screen combat using the stylus, the idea of buying buttons as item upgrades, and liked nothing about it.

65265,1,"Granted I'm not all that great at fighting games, but I can usually at least muddle my way through a few levels and squeeze some fun out of a game. This game wasn't what I expected at all. The controls are extremely clunky. You have to be in a particular spot to pick up an object, and it's way too easy to stand on top of it instead. Trying to pull off moves seems random at times, with the game favoring the enemy as far as timing goes.

The story is nearly nonexistent. ""So-and-so is at the bridge, go stop him from damaging it."" Why even bother? And what's the point of unlocking characters if you don't get to choose who you can play as? It takes forever to fight one round, and you have to win 2 out of 3 to win the match.

The only thing I found nice about the game was the graphics. It's a very nice looking game. But it wasn't enough to keep me playing for more than an hour."
160305,1,"Here are the facts:

Electronic Arts Says:

... you are limited to five authorizations. So what's an authorization? The first time you actually run the game on a machine, we will authorize that machine. If you reach the authorization limit, the game will not run on a new machine. If you make major changes to the computer (switching out multiple pieces of hardware, install a new OS, etc.) you might need to reauthorize the machine.""

What they don't mention here is that a ""major change"" to your computer can be quite a bit less than changing out multiple pieces of hardware. In fact, changing a keyboard, mouse, or joystick or any number of USB devices could be regarded as a ""major change"". Upgrading drivers for you sound or video card might be a major change. The rules are not defined and you will not know for sure what may or may not use up an authorization.

So if you use up all of your Authorizations? Electronic Arts says:
""Just give us a call...
If you had a run of bad luck, some hardware failures, a botched OS install, your notebook was stolen, you spilled a coke on your keyboard - you get the idea - and all five of your authorizations have been used up, just give us a call. We'll work with you and provide as many additional authorizations as are appropriate.""

What they fail to mention here is that calling Electronic Arts for technical support is not free. You will be charged 2.50/minute plus any toll charges.

Now consider the idea that you have bought 5 Electronic Arts games over time and one by one they all run out of authorizations. When the authorizations start running out, do you honestly want to call EA every time you make a hardware change to ask them to allow you to play a game you already paid for? What a hassle!

Please don't buy this game; don't support this kind of DRM scheme. I don't know if this scheme is to prevent used-game resales or if they really believe it makes a dent in piracy. It doesn't matter why, they are going too far and punishing the honest consumer, so it's time to punish their sales."
117229,1,"What if the Nazis had won world war two?  For that matter, what if, having conquered all of Europe, Hitler's armies invaded the United States?  Imagine that you're a construction worker on a building when suddenly, missiles slam into the girders around you.  Looking up, you see the impossible...a fleet of Nazi zeppelins descending upon your city, accompanied by a fleet of warships, and backed up with hundreds upon hundreds of jets and fighters sweeping among the skyscrapers, blasting everything in sight.

It's a terrific premise for a video game, but unfortunately, that's all ""Turning Point"" has going for it.

""Turning Point"" is your standard first person shooter.  You run around shooting those dastardly Nazis, gathering and swapping weapons as needed, and interacting with the environment at various moments to activate bridges, man machine gun turrets, and plant bombs.  All pretty standard affairs with nothing too extraordinary, save for being able to occasionally grapple an enemy in hand to hand combat, whereupon you can either take them hostage as a human shield, or kill them easily.  While most of those kills are variations of knocking them out with your fists, bashing them with weapons, etc. a few are occasionally quite humorous, such as chucking a paratrooper off a skyscraper, tossing a thug into a furnace and locking the doors shut (Irony!), or drowning one unfortunate soldier in a toilet bowl.

However, aside from its instant kills and the fantastic premise, ""Turning Point"" doesn't really work, for the simple fact that it feels unfinished.  With such a Hollywood caliber premise, the story in ""Turning Point"" is practically non-existent, outside of a handful of cut scenes.  Characters come and go at random, and are all equally forgettable.  The player character is a construction worker who wears a red shirt and has no personality, motives, or goals, and is frequently sent in by trained marines to do their dirty work.

Gameplay is average, with not much to distinguish it.  Your foes are competent, though not particularly smart.  They'll attack you en mass to try and make up for their average AI, which largely resorts to ducking behind obstacles and chucking LOTS of grenades (one big problem: the grenade indicator does not tell you how close a grenade is to your position, which makes it nearly impossible to figure out if you're going to get hit or not).  If you take too much damage, you have to retreat to heal, which happens very quickly, as you heal in about three seconds, no matter how much damage you take.  However, this won't help you in the last third of the game, which throws hordes of enemies your way who have much better accuracy then their first and second level counterparts.  In one nightmarishly difficult sequence on a bridge, you'll be assaulted by at least ten guys with rockets, rapid fire sniper rifles, combat shotguns, a few blimps, and even a giant zeppelin.  Add in the fact that checkpoints are few and far between, and the last act of the game, or most of the game for that matter, just isn't any fun.

In keeping in line with the thin story, levels are connected by the barest of threads.  At the beginning of the game, your goal is to escape and head to Washington.  After a cut scene, you're suddenly in a safe house and have to defend it, with no explanation of how you got there, or what you were doing there in the first place.  This jumpy feeling pervades every area of the game, and as a result, we have no emotional interest in it.  Even when we're told that the fate of the world is in our hands, we just don't care.  There's so much potential in this world for a great story, and it's left completely untapped.  When the end credits rolls around, we're left wondering why we didn't see more of it.  Is Hitler still alive?  Does Canada and Mexico join forces with the United States?  What about Japan and Russia?  We never find out the answers to these questions, and countless others.

It's a shame really.  While the first level of the game does an outstanding job immersing you in the world, once you exit the skyscraper, it all goes down hill.  ""Turning Point"" is proof that a fantastic idea can only go so far without good execution.  While it has an outstanding premise and a fantastic opening sequence, a non-existent story, poor characters, and unfinished feel make it a dull game that is ultimately not worth your time."
74422,1,"UPDATE:
Chances are you aren't going to buy this, since the latest reviews are 3 years old. The Adapter failed inexplicably after some time and refused to work. Be sure to look into the new Wireless N adapter or the don't worry about it at all since the Xbox 360 ""Slim"" models feature built in Wireless N adapters.

----
(original review)

The Wireless Network Adapter was pretty much a breeze to setup. I brought my Xbox360 to my friend's and it immmediately ""latched onto"" an available wireless network.

At home I have a WEP encrypted/secure network. Through the console settings, the adapter found my network. I think plugged in my password and it was easy from there. I wasn't sure how games like Gears of War, Rainbow Six: Vegas and Lost Planet (read: fun multiplayer games) would handle. Turns out they work out fine on my 802.11g network.

I'll echo another reviewer's issue: when turning on the Xbox, you have to make sure that the USB plug is firmly seated into the USB port of the console. When bringing the console over to a friend's, I hadn't pushed it all the way in and there was no activity light on the adapter itself (not red, nor green, no light at all). Once I unplugged and plugged it back in, it lit up.

So far so good. Yes, expensive, but it works fine."
345857,1,"This Sequel/Movie Tie-in is short and bitter.

The game is not a true sequel as the whole game takes place after War for Cybertron but before Fall of Cyberton. It's a side story really, it starts in the Movie fictional world and it's about certain event that happens in the past and you replay those events that occured in the Games universe.

The Movie universe parts of the game are events that happen just after the movie.

Graphics are probably the worst of the whole series, super pixelated paired with the poorest AI and voice acting possible. Even the PS2 and Original XBOX could have pushed out a similar looking game.

The game and it's story serves no purpose other than to sell something titled Transformers at the same time a slew of Toy and Movie comes out the same time and to gouge every dollar from you.

**** - BEWARE - SPOILERS BELOW - *********

They talk about Multiverses and your not sure if the events of the game really relate to each other in the movie world because everything is super vague in details. The main object in the game you really never see it in it's true glory, it's more of a tease than a plot.

The ending is the worse as it basically says that your time is wasted in the game *****SPOILER***** because The Dark Spark (The Decepticon Matrix) travels the multiverse and when it leaves the movie universe at the very end it goes back the Game universe and then the credits roll. So it may be the next TRUE sequel to Fall of Cybertron.

Your never sure that the two universes are really part of the same continuity or if their separate tales woven together and the ending makes it more confusing to know what you exactly played for."
333124,1,"Why did Nintendo waste its time, energy, and precious resources in re-creating an otherwise already stale SNES title? This game is basically the same as a Link between worlds. The resemblence is uncanny. There's a reason why games are supposed to evolve over time, not re-create the same stale levels, dungeons, and ridiculously difficult environments that Ocarina of Time Zelda fans have grown to hate. I would much rather see a sequel for Majora's mask on 3DS... why didn't they do that? This game is a major flop! Spend your money on something fun like Pokemon instead."

I guess it is great for the millions of people who have never done anything real, but just do gaming all the time. Probably it seems cool for them, but for any kind of a real hunter, it is not realistic at all. It's just a shoot 'em up game on a timer, just like any Arcade game.

After playing the game a couple of times, it was easy to figure out why it was so cheap.  The controls are horrible!  It was frustrating for all of us to maneuver Anubis around. As for the actual game - it got tired quick.

Save your money and pass on this game.  The concept is cool but the game is not.  Although, my youngest did laugh himself silly as we made Anubis unintentionally fly around.  It was not as much fun for the rest of us."

400579,1,"EA has ruined this franchise the same as Activision did with COD. If you buy a game you should be able to play it 24/7 365 WITHOUT Internet. Essentially they are permanently renting you the game but letting you keep a plastic disc so you feel better about it. Some of us don't care about multi-player. For those of you born after 2000, games used to be just fine without an online experience. It's fine if you wanna play online but it shouldn't be required once the money has changed hands."
200402,1,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. The AI is useless, the graphics are muddy, the controls are buggy and awkward, the gameplay is repeditive and uninteresting, the list goes on and on and on. More than half the game is impossible to play without 7 other friemds because the AI on your side won't work with you to acomplish missions and the AI on the other team is extremely agressive and imbalanced. When you have to put a whole clip in a character to kill them and it only takes one hit for you to die it makes acomplishing your missions against infinitly respawning NPCs 8 on 1virtually impossible. Especially when acomplishing that mission means you cant us a gun like durring ""hacking"" missions. I expect more from Bethesda Softworks. I just wanted to tell whoever will listen; do not buy this game. I will be spending the next two hours giving this game bad reviews on every website I can find. With any luck I will prevent someone from wasting even one cent on this piece of garbage. If I knew I was buying a coaster I would have opted for one withhout a hole in it."

At different times, I would get a sort of flare on the screen that would block out half of the action and effectively render that particular game over or unplayable. As a result, I have only played this game a couple of times, which hurts given the expense. I have tried looking for patches but frankly I resent having to spend so much time trying to effectively repair something that should have worked out of the box. This game looks promising with all of the new equipment but if it's not going to work smoothly, then it might as well be junk. Unfortunately, I don't have a nephew to give it away to."

ok graphics

Fun combos

creating a character

brand new stages

Cons

Religious in a BAD way. The game make more ""GOD"" characters making heavy use of the word in the game over and over. Not cool at all if you actually believe in God.

No difficulty setting option. Most battles are 1 vs 2 leading up to 1 vs 10+ with no health regeneration.  Its a handicap gauntlet and the a.i is very hard. I lost track of the amount of deaths.

Rpg not a fighting game! This on is big for me, this game was advertising its ""tenkaichi"" inspired combos promising to be a DragonBall masterpiece. .we its no, its a slow rpg level up mentality no a 2015 dbz fighting masterpiece.

Slow level up system

Creation clothing hard to get.

Fan fiction story that feels like a power point as you click thru endless pointless text rambling. It feels like they did whatever they wanted not what fans needed.

No traditional story mode in HD. Zero use of z heros in storytelling, the entire game can be seen in trailers, you fix time by stopping evil thats the big game. ..no really thats it..they just drag that concept out.

no 1 vs 1 menu option. Because this is an rpg you must search for the option under the in game kiosk labled offline battles in a very buried option...rediculous.

Extremely lacking characters,the focus of the game was to cater to the new fans and leave the loyal. There use of dbz kai voices is heavy, even gt kid goku who was never recasted got a new pitchy voice. Gotenks now talks like a hipster and so does recome.

The wost fighting mechanics, you're strike attacks will only land 65% of the time. I found dead because more often than not, my character was punching air.

power point presentation gameplay. .out with the voice overs and in with the endless reading.  This game take a HUGE step back with this, as it feels like a ps one game with enhanced graphics in a bad way.

overall I can do this all day, it is for the new crowd of fans not the real fans. It just caters to people born after the show went off air..its harder than any game has a right to be. .and isn't going to be much fun...just buy a ps2 and play the tenkaichi series..raging blast one if you want HD..the is the truth. Goodluck!"
43883,1,"Beware: This program, like many other recent games, will ONLY run properly on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000.

441585,1,There is nothing realistic about this game.  FIFA has degraded into absurdity.  Soccer is not a sport that goes a million miles an hour.  This game has the feel that they tried to market it to people with ADD who have no patience.  The speed is awful...there is no flow to the game.  It's like watching the ball bounce around while everybody is on crystal meth.  Even controlling the players is awful and passing is STILL hit or miss.  Since playing online I've only gotten to play against Barcelona using Arsenal.  It is an utter joke watching people abuse the pace feature which EA apparently still refuses to address.  The whole reason they switched to the Frostbite engine is to deflect from how bad the game really is...this is now the main talking point.  Visually it is impressive but until EA gets a clue this game will continue to disappoint true soccer fans and soccer game aficionados.

318592,1,"I really wanted Astro A30's. I thought they would be high quality. But without the Mix Amp that costs an additional 100$, the A30's sound like crap. And I'm just assuming they sound better with the Mix Amp because I don't see how else they'd be able to sell these. They have NO base, and the mids and highs are severely lacking also. I'm not an audiophile either, not even remotely close. I don't listen to FLAK files, I listen to MP3's.

There is just such a HUGE difference between the sound of the Astro A40's and the sound of the Astro A30's that once you hear the A40's, you'll think somethings wrong with your A30's. You'll think they are busted or something. Because once I got my A40's I thought my A30's were broken. But as it turns out, my brother A30's sounded the exact same way. So I'm actually a fan of Astro's. I love me some Astro's. I love the A50's, I love the A40's. But the A30's are complete junk.

I mean honestly, they really sound bad. Don't get these. You may not notice they sound like crap, UNTIL you get a good sounding headset to compare it with. At which point you'll think your A30's are broken.

If you don't know what a good headset sounds like you MAY like these, SO GO FOR IT."
21449,1,"This is an absolutely horrible game.  The first thing you notice, though fairly trivial, is that the graphics are bad.  There's no changing the resolution or the color depth, so it runs at what appears to be 640x480 or something with a very low color depth.  Everything's grainy with banding due to lack of color.
The next biggest problem is that the navigation is terrible.  You move forward by clicking when you randomly pass the cursor over the right spot and the cursor turn to the right shape.  But, to turn, you either have to use the cursor keys (which do an instantaneous turn instead of a pan, so it's hard to hold an image in your head of where you are), or you click and PUSH the mouse in the direction you want to turn instead of clicking and dragging the window in that direction (and the pan is so fast you can't see the scenery go by).  There's no cursor change in those cases.  Then, if you can look up or down, the only indication you have is a change to an icon down below the scene in your inventory.  Plus, the cursor shape indicating a possible path is very easy to confuse as to where it's really pointing.  In some cases, clicking forward will turn you 45 degrees before proceeding to take you somewhere nowhere near where it looked like it would take you.  In other cases, you think it's pointing somewhere you've been, but it's not (so you miss a path).  You end up watching the cursor and thinking about the mechanics of movement instead of looking at the scenery and tying to figure out what's going on.  Also irritating is that once you click to go forward, it will stop at multiple, non-significant spots (even on straight, non-divertable paths).  So, you spend time sweeping the cursor over everything in every direction wondering what's so important that the game stopped you here.
But, the biggest problem is the puzzles themselves.  The charitable description would be that they're impossibly hard.  A more accurate description is that there's neither rhyme nor reason to them.  In some cases, there's no indication that a device IS a puzzle and not just a static display.  If you don't have a necessary inventory item, you can't do anything and there's no indication that you could EVER do anything in it.  If you have some random inventory item that it expects, it just changes the cursor in the right place (if you happen to cross the spot) and you drop it on.  In others, the puzzle is so vague that you're not even sure what you're supposed to be doing with it or why.  Then you have to work your way through multiple, non-easily-written notation systems or phonetics.  In my case, I uninstalled the game when it became obvious that it wanted me to reproduce some long string of barely heard, non-phonetically-writeable, background-noise-filled, alien speech on a set of devices strewn in four or six places about a very large room.
Impossible.  Not fun in the least.  Do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this game."

229767,1,"I had the opportunity of playing this game on Xbox 360 several months ago, and dedicated my time on finishing the single player game. Story wise, this game is pretty magnificent, as well as being a game with superb graphics and excellent soundtrack.

I decided to buy the digital Deluxe Edition to be able to play multiplayer as well as relive some of the fantastic moments of the game.

Sadly, this game is broken.

The game runs at unbearable low frames per second, and its almost impossible to make it pass the first menus. I own a pretty solid computer on which I am playing Star Wars: The Old Republic, Skyrim and Modern Warfare 3 on high settings all of them, and I haven't had any problem until now. In fact, I own Assassin's Creed 2 and Assassin's Creed Revelations and these both games are running fine.

I have tried looking for a solution online for several hours now, and I haven't found any indication on how to fix the problem with this game.

On top of that, the game offers me no possibility of playing in multiplayer, as the option is greyed out.

Looking through Steam forums, there seems to be a great number of people having this problem with the game.

I wished I could return this game, but I doubt it being a digital version, but I feel I wasted my money on a version of the game with so many bugs. I consider myself as someone who knows about fixing problems with games, but a game that is prerry much unplayable right at the very start, it's simply not worth the time.

If I would rate the 360 version, I would have given it lot more stars, but considering that this version, considering that no matter what I do remains unplayable, I would never recommend to anyone."
468020,1,"From controls to boss design, this thing is a good argument vfor video game abortion.

Just so you get the right idea:
1) You cannot play this game with anything but the wiimote + nunchuck.
2) The nunchuck's accelerometer is the single most used control in the game
3) Reread #2. If you honestly don't understand why its so bad that the single most important function of the game - accurate dodging - is using the s***tier accelerometer in your non-dominant hand, you don't know anything about fighting games.
4) Holy crap. This entire game is hack and slash with dodging. If dodging were actually capable of being done accurately. But I digress on the dodging. Your right arm will fall off. There is simply nothing to do, you just walk, avoid stupid obstacles (like blind-corner rolling boulders LOLOL so much fun!) and flail your right arm around like a lunatic.
5) The designers of this game thought a good way to design boss fights was to make bosses have toggle-able invincibility. Let me explain how this works. Whenever you get close enough to attack a boss, they will become invincible and all your attacks will be repelled. I'm not even kidding either. That's actually what you will face if you buy this game and attempt to play it. You will literally be sitting on your couch, trying to clear a boss fight, carefully dodge all the boss' abilities (or at least attempt to, see #2), and then run up to him and start flailing your right arm, only to hear the ""parry"" sound and notice you did absolutely nothing. Soul calibur, a game based on combos and traditional 2d fighting game mechanics, employs bosses that cannot be comboed for more than 2 hits. Seriously astoundingly terrible.

Do not play this game.
Do not buy it."

The graphics are very cool and the soundtrack amiable enough but the gameplay is so boring and gets very old and tired even by the second stage. It was cool slicing the bad folks in half the first few times but when the game takes time out to show them spurting blood for the fifty-millionth time it seriously gets on your nerves.

438277,1,"Activision REALLY needs to start listening to their fans... This has to be tied with the worst COD titles ever made to date. The single player is okay, at best. The story and plot are predictable, but the action and gameplay make up for it in some regards. There are some very unique moments in the game, such as avoiding the sun on an out of control asteroid, spiraling towards the sun while trying to get to the hangar to find and rescue any survivors; landing on Mars and assaulting the enemy base, etc.

That said, single player is the best that this title has to offer, which is shocking for COD as it's usually the opposite.  Multiplayer is beyond horrific and in my opinion, unplayable and completely disappointing. Jet-packs, wall running and knee slides all serve to ruin the fun and the pace of the game; guns are grossly under powered in many cases;  quick-scoping is a dime a dozen and makes most maps completely unfun to play as you end up dying almost as soon as you spawn; I've been the victim on three separate occasions of spawn campers, which had never happened before in previous COD titles; the maps are more or less the same damned thing that has been done before in the past 10 titles or so, but with different skins; and worse than all, the dynamics of the character creation are all but identical to Black Ops 3..

The only redeeming feature of this title, is the inclusion of the COD:MW Remastered. Raven did a great job on this, with the resolution and tweaks to animation and sounds being superior and adding to the fun; and the game is exactly as I remember playing it 9 years ago today.. Just wish that they would release the Holiday version of Crash already!!

Please do not buy this design... yet. like all good things time is needed to improve the design and maybe then valve will do well in the physical accessories department."
412902,1,"First of all, it's $50. I want you to say that in your head over and over like I have while looking at this thing. It looks nothing like the picture. The controller in the picture looks very well made. It's flat black and the material looks comparable to the best Sony controllers out there. Not at all representative of what you'll receive and they shouldn't be allowed to use that picture. What you'll get is glossy, cheap plastic that weighs so close to nothing at all that it might confuse you at first. I'd honestly like to see whats inside it because I'd bet it's hilarious. There's no mic plug for a headset. There's no vibration. It's wired. The triggers are very shallow and have to be pressed hard to work. This might be the worst controller I've ever seen. And that's okay BUT $50? It shouldn't be a penny more than $10 and after seeing the thing, you'd most likely want your $10 back. The regular Sony controller is MASSIVELY better than this. I actually thought that I was getting an upgrade from looking at that picture. So far from the truth though"
394753,1,"I really want to love this game, but it is a very challenging game - more in a buggy way than a good way. My kids want to play this, but I dread it, because it is non-stop complaints about how hard and confusing the game is. I have to sit over their shoulders taking the controls constantly to figure things out. It usually takes me awhile to figure it out.

My kids play Mario, Kirby, Nintendo World, Pokemon and a ton of other games with no issues. The Lego games are always a big letdown and this one is no different. Hopefully they release an update to make everything more intuitive and less about ""puzzle solving"" for no reason."
177440,1,"What to Say. Running from point A to B,mashing buttons,and indulging in repetitive backtracking. This is the game for you.
There is nothing ELSE to do. Just wave your sword and hope the enemy goes down in a pile of heap.
The sword you upgrade is worthless,because the increase in stats does not change or affect the gameplay.
Graphics are ok,in an unclean sort of way. There is no story to keep trudging in a meaningful way.
NOT RECOMMENDED."
439042,1,"Really bad multiplayer.  most everyone is sniping and camping.  The middle of the map is like a wasteland because if you rush you will lose.  Its basically 10 campers behind rocks shooting another 10 campers behind other rocks.  You die from the weirdest angles because of squad spawn.  Im not the greatest FPS player, but there are many other FPS games that I wasn't that great at that I loved. The guns are super weak except the sniper of course which creates campers galore.  I'm not  a cod fanboy either, i'm not the biggest fan of the latest COD's either.  This game is overrated and overrun by elitists who love the game, basically both COD and BF, like republicans and democrats, leave much to desire."
275662,1,"I would ABSOLUTELY pay $20 for a collection of 30 games, EVEN if 20 of them suck. I'm soooooo sick of games like THIS that really only give you a select few games to begin with and force you to try to beat/win THOSE (usually) lame games in order to unlock another few, and so on. Come on!! People BUY this because it APPEARS to be a ""collection of games"", offering variety, NOT to ""beat it"" and be challenged by ""leveling up"" in attempt to FORCE repeat play. MOST consumers are genuinely angry to discover the ""unlock"" feature, not challenged or excited by it. They lose interest in the game, trade it in and it gets a low rating."
397037,1,"Like many others who have already commented, I pre-ordered the game because I am a huge Star Wars fan and have spent many hours playing FPS games like the Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Unreal Tournament franchises. Caveat emptor! While it is nice to see fantastic graphics and some of the Star Wars characters the game itself just fails on many levels.

The promise was for crafted missions that are played solo or cooperatively. Great! My friends and I play co-op all the time. This game has only 5 training missions and a few survival maps that are actually co-op. Crafted missions is a lie. These missions that you play are nothing but Player vs Player.

Lets say you don't care about co-op. The PvP play fails too. The maps are small, unimaginative, and just plain boring. The original Unreal Tournament was released 16 years ago. There is no excuse for creating such crappy maps in 2015.

Regardless of which mode you prefer, the gameplay is weak on all levels. The customization of what your character looks like [in a FPS environment] is substantially larger than your weapons selection. And your armor selection? Non-existent. I may be in the minority but I don't care what my character looks like. This is supposed to be Star Wars Battlefront not Star Wars Fashion Week.

This game has the appearance of putting $55 of the $60 game cost towards Star Wars licensing and the leftover $5 towards the actual game. If you have not purchased the game yet I strongly encourage you to consider something else first."

I don't play this game because I want it to be like my reality, I play this game to escape. I played on Senior Detective. From looking at walkthroughs online, I did not get some of the clues that others did so I was really lost on a key part of the game. Specifically, I never got the code information from the guy on the phone. From posts online it appears that I stumbled upon the first part of the puzzle and completed it without needing the clue and therefore never got the clue. This made the other 4 parts of the puzzle I was supposed to complete near impossible. Then, within the game you had to play a game with one of the characters and win 3 times. This was very difficult on the Senior level because the computer never made an error, but I did all the time! I hated that game and would never play it in real life.

So, long story short, issues with the story, the stupid duck and fox game, and having to be the lodge slave made this game AWFUL!"

6493,1,"wow. i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games( which is clearly evident in games like, starcraft, warcraft, diablo)well i bought this game, and it was stupid. this is what i affectionately call a ""clicker"" game. you know, i left click on you,i hit you, i right clic on you, i do a magic thing. boring. they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing, but the fact that it'll always be the same thing, every time you play it, doesn't really give you much re-play value. also a killer is the mandatory quests,you must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot. if you really want a real RPG, buy Baldur's Gate, it's cheaper, and you get to completely make your character, and there's a totally non-linear plot. do waht you want, or don't, but be prepared to suffer the consequences. Baldur's Gate puts YOU the gamer in control, while diablo 2, you are just kinda along for the ride. diablo 2 is deffinitely a game for those simple-minded gamers, who don't really like the whole variable plot thing,the ones that don't like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to, the ones who just want to click their way to victory. this game gets one star, which is many , many more than it deserves"

260808,1,"I have been a fan since i played the original ME1 amd ME2 both on Xbox and PC! And Mass Effect 3 is very disappointing! I purchased the PC digital deluxe edition (80 bucks down the drain)and the only truly decent part of the game is the ashes DLC! I have been only able to import 3 of my Shepard character out of some 9 having completed ME1 and ME2! I find that any choices i had made have little or no effect in ME3! Worse still this game is rather short it is almost as if it is geared more toward co-op than actual single player! Added to that the games has rather annoying bugs such as freezing up movement to weapons not firing and even powers not working! While i expect the bugs to be fixed with patches eventually, i find that the story is the true disappointment!

SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!

I had chosen Anderson  as the council member in nearly all my characters save 1. When ME3 starts udina is the council member and Anderson is an admiral! What a complete waste!

I had chosen to save the rachni queen! In ME3 she is controlled by the reapers and i get the glorious opportunity ti either save her again or kill her! I had chosen to save her again thinking I might get something good or useful! What i get is a foot note about the rachni helping on the crucible! YAY! I am better off saving grunts company!

Another let down is the idiotic dream sequences (lost count of how many there are) where my Shepard gets to move real slow chasing a dead kid that does not show or tell me any important things related to the game! It is utterly pointless!

Another and perhaps the biggest let down is the ME3 choice system my choices where the most logical and reasonable ones i could possible make (not import ME1 or ME2 choices) yet the outcomes are rather different from what you are expecting. For instance the quarians ask for help to free their trapped fleet. I help them to get their fleet free and instead they attack the geth dreadnaught while i am on board it instead of retreating to safety. I later learn despite my choice (in ME2) to have the qurians not attack the geth i learn it was the quarians who started the war with the geth who were acting peaceful! When i try to fix the issue by saving admiral khoris he commits suicide! I got so pissed i just let the geth kill all the quarians which resulted in tali committing suicide. Ultra LAME!

These are but a few of the many problems with this game! But hey at least the co-op is decent right? I should have just stuck with the free demo. ME3 is anything but epic. At best this game rates a 3.5 and that is only for the barely decent third person shooter that this game is! The RPG element of this game is merely an after thought at best.

And while i do find the orgin requirement annoying you can just download a crack to by pass the orgin but you will have to forgo your DLC which is not really worth it as ashes is perhaps the only real fun part of this game."

I could go on but then i would have to keep reliving the short hour I played this turd. And what is the worst part, you guessed it the price.

316654,1,"System arrived poorly boxed. The top of the box had a lot of air bagging but the bottom and sides had nothing. I know how UPS handles packages and could easily been dropped or throw in shipping. Poor packing on amazon's side.

Package arrived release day at around 5pm est. After opening the packaging, i setup the system and  the system would not boot up. Instead I received a blue pulsing light on the top and nothing else. I then searched the internet to see what was going on. I checked for HDMI issue, but my system was fine in that regards. I also check to make sure HDD was secure and that was fine also. The system just will not boot. I am downloading patch now and will try that. if that fails, I will test the HDD to make sure its functioning. I am also unable to get into safe mode as holding the power button only turns off my system.

I have tried everything from different HDMI cables to different TV's etc. the system was DOA. I have to say i am very angry about all this. I tried calling Sony, but gave up after being on hold for about 2 hours.

If you are thinking of getting a PS4, i would suggest waiting until they get their act together. They have yet to make a real statement nor are they offering good customer service. I hear that most people have to return the unit to Sony and way 4-6 weeks for a new one. Amazon has none either so they only offer a refund (which I may decided to do and get an Xbox one) I would prefer a Sony, but since they are not acting on this and treating it like its no big deal... really gets me mad."

This game was boring, it has a weak plot, and stupid characters.  The list of people who worked on this game which appeared after it was completed, was HUGE.

after a firmware update, it's totally died. Out of warranty too. What a piece of crap, Logitech!

Update 10/11/16: after a tiny water splash on to the keyboard, my keyboard lost 1/3 of the led. It was just a few drops of water, didn't realize this keyboard isn't splash proof. $100+ keyboard and not water splash proof....

Great keyboard, everything is silky smooth, love typing on it so far, ultra fast response, upgraded from G510s. My old G510s lasted me a good year, before the space key gives out two multiple spaces instead of one. Can't believe how good this keyboard is... so far only been typing on it, well update after more test.

So far after 1 hour of testing:

Led on this was super bright. Had to tune it down, never have I had to tune a lighted keyboard's brightness down before.

244903,1,"I've had this since launch, bought it from GameStop who I hate but they were near my house so yeah. I paid $400 with 2 free games. The PROBLEM is I didn't keep my receipt... lost it when cleaning out my bedroom and rearranging stuff... and the TV just started going black for no reason, at first I thought it was my Mac mouse cursor hitting my hot corner randomly and going into sleep mode but no, it just does it on it's own for no reason at all and now I'm stuck with it. SURE, while the TV functions it's quite great, movies looks good, 3D is kind of dark but movies like TRON look amazing etc. I also bought the Sony PS3 remote which works decent enough. I'm just stuck with a TV that will probably die soon for NO REASON and I'm not sending it off for warranty repair unless they have a definite fix and can state the problem directly to we the consumers. I like Sony but forget their TV's and this is from a rare double dip pissed of original 60GB PS3 YLOD after 14 months owner, I bought a 40GB and it's still going though.

JUST FORGET BUYING THIS, it's not worth the malfunctioning potential death worry... spend your money on a good Toshiba, or Sharp I've never had a bad tv from those makers and I'm probably going to get another Sharp if I can find they make a decently priced active 3D HDTV.

EDIT April 19th 2012, WELL it's still working... it SEEMS that the random black screen mainly happens when using it as a monitor for my Mac via HDMI, SO perhaps it's a signal aberration which is telling the TV that it's switching off when it reality it's only switching applications on my Mac? could be, I've yet to notice the screen turning black while running anything on my PS3, games, movies etc... so I have no conclusive idea that there is a technical problem with this TV via PS3 usage... which would concern most would be buyers. In theory I think this concept and what this HD3DTV offers is too good to be true."

If you actually have the patience to go through the pain of having to restart it every 2-3 hours (because it hangs), remove the profile file every 2-3 days (because it gets into certain points on the campaign map where it crashes all the time and can't get past without doing something like this) and even reinstall it every week or so, then you will discover one of the best stories ever told in the Heroes of Might and Magic series. But that's a big IF, so I think all that wasted time could be better spent on games that actually work."
88900,1,"After playing Live for the 360, it made me fall asleep, it was boring and while the graphics are excellent, it just has this weird vibe. The shots do not come off right, the shooting animation is so slow that you can have a wide open guy on the wing and by the time he gets up and into the air and release the shot, a defender can make up serious ground and block it.  Against the computer, I had JJ Reddick and Turkoglu blocked 5 times apiece by Mourning and Shaq coming from the basket on what were wide open shots. There are also a ton of missed dunks, even Howard missed several. It is hard to pull of three's as well, since their guaranteed bricks.

The point guard and fatigue issue also sucks. The comp team never subs regardless of sliders. And their point guard scores 90% of the points. I played vs. Milwaukee and Maurice Williams scored practically every basket. This occured regardless of what level. Edit player is also a joke; I cannot edit the height, but at least I can edit the number and position. The rosters were supposed to be as of Aug. 24th, but where is Turiaf? And why is Battie a FA, he was never renounced or waived!

The press box angle is actually not bad. I dunno why Live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways, things like hook-shot style passes, behind the backs, even though the situation does not need those. The subsitution is also clunky; you can do the sub using the D-pad during a break in the action, but by the time you select the player you are bringing in, the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the court.

The timeouts are also timed, as in if you call a 20, there is a 20 second clock and so on. But you can always press a button to continue. The archs on the shots are off as well. Who shoots a high-archer in the paint? There are no retroes unless their unlockable. The courts look good but they don't have mascots, so it seems kinda dead. That should be the new name of this series. NBA DEAD 07.

I don't blame Mac for signing an NBA 2K7 game during Live's launch party. He knows what game is better!"

So I have had no success with either XP or Win 7. Some have commented about having the same sorts of problems with any Paradox Software they have purchased. But I have had and successfully run Paradox's Hearts of Iron 2/Doomsday/Armageddon on both of these computers for years. So I was really disappointed that EU Rome Gold failed. Didn't think it would.

215264,1,"Well I was so looking forward to this game. I was let down by the great hype machine. And the big drop in price already should tell you people something. If your getting it for the campaign Dont Buy It..rent it instead..
Single Player Campaign  is really short. (5 Hours)
Controls are sluggish.
Hit detection is off.
Takes alot  of shots sometime in the head to get it to detect it and the enemy finally dies.
You can get hung up on a little rock and the enemy can shoot you behind rock cover as well.
And it is very laughable on how your character throws grenades.

The story itself wasn't flawed. Just the way it was carried out within the game. Framerate slows down to where the screen studders along.

Multiplayer (Updated) Finally 24 hours later was able to play the multiplayer portion.
Multiplayer has potential once the server issues and glitches are fixed. But does it make up for the campaign short falls? Yes It Does.

For a game that has been out 24 hours and with the server problems you still have people maxed out on rank all ready.

Overall this isn't worth the $60 I paid for it. And still isn't worth the $41 they are selling it for now.

Guess I am back off to Battlefield Bad Company 2.

My original rating was one star. but since the multiplayer made up for some of the slack I give it 3 stars now...."

272156,1,"This game is TERRIBLE!!! Do not buy it!
Since this review has earned me a LOT of flak, I figured I'd update it and give the rabid fan's that have been bombing me a little more information as to why I gave this atrocious game a 1 star review;

I was very excited about this game, excited to a point where I was rabidly following any update I could find. Like an addict, I had to get my fix. So to say that this game was unfulfilling is a polite understatement. This is a game that was so vastly disappointing to me that it's taken awhile to calm down enough to write about it.

Let's talk about the good things, because it will be brief. Aliens Colonial Marines started off on a good note. Sure, the graphics were disappointing after such a long development cycle, but it's forgivable, at first, because your just so bloody EXCITED to start playing. Again at first, it's good. It's atmospheric, it uses the sounds and lighting in great ways. You feel tense, and it's perfect. It's the kind of Aliens game that you've been waiting for.

Sadly, for single player, that's about where the good things end. Multi-player provides a decent experience, even if the weapons are terrible and the game types are dated. Imagine the multi-player as Left 4 Dead, where all the Zombies have been removed and you're just playing against special infected. It's fun, and it provides its thrills, but eventually you do start to feel drained by it.

As is typical for the more recent additions to the Aliens video games, this is simply another disappointment in a long string of disappointments. The game engine is weak, to a point where it's more common for the game to glitch out and break down than work properly. The weapons are terrible. Whats the point of being able to carry so many if they all suck?

At first the pulse rifle is pretty great, and in single player it is legitimately the go-to weapon. Things like the flame thrower, smart gun and turrets are a blast, but eventually, like everything else, they simply fall way short of the mark.

The AI is a disaster. The aliens in single player are so predictable that you can count on them to ALWAYS make a bee line for you unless your playing in co-op. Your `friendly' marine AI is so bad it almost seems like they take pleasure in watching you get mauled to death and they will literally watch an alien beat you to death without doing a single thing to save you.
Worse, you can actually shoot THROUGH your teammates as if they weren't there, and vice versa, the aliens can leap through the AI characters like they were phantoms. The hit boxes are a wreck, with the only consistent thing being that head shots don't count as head shots. Character animations are choppy, to be nice about it, and how they interact with the game world is so terrible that it's common for you to `trip' on a rough edge in a level and get insta gibbed by fall damage.

As for the story line, it's confusing to me that for the first 10 minutes, they get the recipe right only to have it just crash and burn. It's almost as if they intentionally worked only on the parts they would display for the previews, and just went `Meh, who cares.' I'll give you an example, and I'm sorry for the spoilers, but for the majority of the game, YOU DON'T EVEN FIGHT ALIENS.

For whatever asinine reason, most of this game is spent fighting the private militia of the Weyland-Yutani Corp. I guess having us play a game that's based on the premise of fighting Aliens was just too much for the good people at Gearbox/TimeGate Studios to handle. It's a move that had me shaking my head, because how did this make sense to anyone during development? `Lets make a game about fighting aliens, but you barely ever get to fight aliens.' Sure, sound plan, makes perfect sense.

Aliens Colonial Marines isn't just a disappointing game, because it's not simply bad, for a `game of passion,' that Gearbox was so utterly fanatic about, this is a travesty. It's a crappy game with the Aliens brand name slapped on top, a more blatant cash grab than I care to consider. This is nigh unforgivable. And to add insult to injury, insider leaks are pointing to the fact that Gearbox lied to us about how much control and work they actually put into the game. Important figureheads at Gearbox are on record saying that they were responsible for something like '80%' of the game, when in fact it turns out that they may have designed a level or two in Multi-player. Maybe. Turns out that TimeGate Studios has been in charge of this `hellish development cycle,' for years now, and they are responsible for making the majority of this game. Why lie about it? Well TimeGate has a rather dismal record when it comes to making games. You might remember them for, well, nothing really. They've never been able to produce a quality game, although to be honest, they have a really clever PR department.

At the end of the day, all my ranting boils down to two points; This game is awful, and the only redeeming factor about it is Multi-player, but even that is a tedious, glitchy and rage inducing affair. Do yourself a favor and rent this one if your really curious, I know from checking earlier today that Redbox is already carrying this. Regardless of whatever nostalgic feelings you might have towards this brand, this game utilizes the Aliens name as little more than a hollow gimmick to reel you in and steal your money. Honestly, this game is so bad it's not even worth the bandwidth required to pirate it.

For the folks giving me flak about the original review; Go look it up on Youtube you poor saps.
It is possible to beat this game in 3 hours, at max difficulty settings, if you don't play like a drunken chimpanzee.
If your competent enough to figure out where the dev's might have dropped a spawn point or a trigger, you can literally run through most of this game without having to fire a shot.[...]or youtube 'Aliens Colonial Marines Pacifist Mode' for a really great example of how easy it is.)

Rent this if you can. If you already bought it, my condolences."

Again I must say that I was very disappointed in the story arc, which seemed to pay no attention to the tiny golden details of the first two games. About midway through the game I was left scratching my head at many inconsistencies and plotholes that were a result of obvious laziness on the part of Bioware devs.

Music is...competent. Nothing grand like Skyrim. It is sort of...""boopy"". If you're expecting something ""spacey"" like Michael Stearns or Steve Roach, forget it. Even Star Control II (3do) had better music.

The Bad:

The homo-sexual angle isn't just subtle like the former games I had played, but rather right in-your-face and had a dare-you-to-say-anything-about-it mentality about them. Is this a video game for kids, or adults? Is it a space opera or a game about gay politics? It was very distracting and had absolutely NO place in the Mass Effect universe. Totally depraved and irresponsible of Ray (CEO) to shove this into the game. I guess we now know what side of the aisle he is on.

Familiarity breeds...very familiar territory as you cut down swarms of stormtrooper-like cerebus troops, geth and cerebus engineers. However, this really started grinding on my nerves after playing for ten hours and seeing the same enemies time after time, much like Gears of War. What the combat lacks is variety of enemies, and some DEPTH to the environments, the kind Fallout 2 had. In short, it lacks a soul. I started to realize that it wasn't an RPG I was playing, but a FPS in the vein of Call of Duty or Gears of War, yet Bioware bills this as an RPG! That is a blatant lie. While I enjoy Gears of War...I know what to expect. The Gears of War devs don't bill their epic SHOOTER as anything other than a fps and not an rpg (and honestly, stealing the cover system from Gears of War was just silly).

Bioware has fallen. This isn't completely the fault of EA. After doing some research on who had played a big part in the creation of the greatest RPG of the 21st century, Baldurs Gate II, I learned that most of the guys that made *that* game have long since left Bioware for greener pastures. Still, Bioware had a duty to re-fill those positions with the brightest minds in the industry, and instead chose people who were experts not at creating absorbing rpg games, but rather those that are experts at creating mindless propaganda pieces, filled with cookie-cutter levels/enemies and ignoring the fans. It is as if NO ONE who worked on Mass Effect 1 had any input on this game. Perhaps the brass tossed the new designers a mass effect 1 disc and said ""here, have a look at this if you have time""?

Origin. Nothing more I can say that hasn't already been stated.

Minor Spoiler Alert:
And what exactly was the deal with stealing a picture off of the net (Tali)? Surely with a multi-million dollar budget, the developers could have done a better job at this?

I will never buy another Bioware game again. Ever.

Perhaps the two CEOs of Bioware should go back into medicine. They have clearly let the money and fame go to their head."
447958,1,The graphics are simple looking. You are in the middle of the screen and little enemies are coming at you from all angles like the old arcade game asteroids. Its real lame-dont get it.
398341,1,"Game play here is great, Many of the other reviews give examples and I agree with them that it is a lot of fun. I also agree with the reviewers who said this is 9/10 game...that is, I agreed with them right up to the point that I experienced a game breaking glitch where you can't save your progress anymore. Checking the developers web site they say basically that they take the issue very seriously and they'll fix it....more than 2 MONTHS AGO and it is still not fixed. What you are left with is a game where you're going to lose progress and that is totally unfit for sale. I'm tired of developers who don't properly test games and foist defective products off on the public. Just google the issue and read the complaints."
273309,1,"Do not buy this for PC multiplayer now. It's too late. The fun has gone out of it. The PC multiplayer is now saturated with players that cheat (and easily get away with it). The cheaters are also those who spout profanity, sexism, racism, and bullying. It's a cesspool. Cheaters always know where you are on the map and they hardly ever miss (hitting regular players that is). They can turn their unauthorized advanced abilities on and off at will. So they start playing without them and as soon as they are not doing so well they turn them on until they are comfortable with their lead and then turn them off. OK, here's my fantasy. Someone invents a program that tracks, verifies and identifies the cheaters and either shuts the hacks down or sends a super virus down their pipe that wipes their hard drives. They SO deserve it. That's the second best idea I have but I do not have this ability. The best idea I have is to stop playing. That I can do and as of this moment, I have done."

I don't like the way they feel on the ps4 controller. Feels like they would come off during intense gameplay. But if your looking for a bigger and softer feel on the analog stick these would be good.

Well I came acrossed it today while shopping and I though WOW! Only 5.69 and I can download it straight to my PC and finally get to play it. DING!!!!! Bad Idea. I made the foolish mistake of doing this, I downloaded the files from the Amazon Games and Software Downloader, I attempt to install the game and to my suprise the files that were downloaded were all currupted (I am smacking myself at this point for even going on the foolish adventure)so I run my compatability program and since I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit and once again...the files are still currupted (Now I am starting to smoke). So I do what every Teir 1, 2, and 3 technical support person would tell you since I have a degree in both software development, and computer networking, and as I suspected my PC has all the current drivers for all its hardware, and software, even ran some checks in Command Prompt, and went into msconfig and hid all Microsoft services. Tried to install it again...still corrupted (Now I am chain smoking and smacking myself for purchacing the download version of this game). Needless to say the game..I couldn't tell you if it was good or bad, never got that far, however I do feel like I was assassinated out of $5.69 bucks that I could have used on smokes. My advice, purchace a hard copy of the game, and if your gonna download a PC game use Steam or EA Download Manager. Because 1: Even at such a low cost I doubt Amazon would remburse me for it, and 2: They will most likely find some way of making it my fault that the files I downloaded from their site where currupted."

155977,1,"If this was the game of the year I'd hate to see the other games!

- The 'roleplay' is almost non-existent.
- Controls are clumsy and awkward - trying to do much with too little;
- Combat consists of essentially blasting away at enemies hoping they die first;
- Very poor LOS checking; you can frequently see the enemy but can't hit them and vice-versa.
- Since the areas where combat occurs are so confined there's simply no tactics involved*.
- Storyline is beyond predictable and the dialog could have been written by a fifth grader.

I suggest you skip this one and play Halo, or Donkey Kong, instead.

* choosing whether to use a pistol or a shotgun is NOT tactics."
112628,1,"I was very disappointed to get this game home.  I was late to the Guitar Hero ""party"".  I've never been musically inclined (of course, I love listening to music), and never had much desire to try it out.  My younger brother had GH1, II, and 80s.  He was finally able to convince me to give it a whirl and I was hooked.  Living in different states and having traded in my PS2 for my PS3 purchase, I was eagerly awaiting this game's release.  I bought it the first day it came out, got it home, and couldn't play.

The guitar, quite simply, would not connect properly.  I got it to sync, but apparently suffered from a weak signal between the guitar and the dongle.  I would have to hit a key numerous times before it would register with the game, making it impossible to play.  Let me just say that Activision using infared INSTEAD of the bluetooth abilities of the PS3 was a very bad idea.  I don't know that I've ever been this disappointed with a video game.  Needless to say, I returned the game and will not buy it until a different guitar is released...wired or bluetooth. Activision should be ashamed of the quality they allowed to be released to the public."

I was wrong, because the 2 pieces that go on the 3ds just easily come off whenever you try to open the 3ds or even while just holding it.

263853,1,"When I am not cleaning floors at my job I am rounding up grocery carts in the parking lot. As I was hustling about yesterday to gather up the carts before the thunderstorm hit, I saw the new guy putting some boxes into his van. People said that he just got out of prison and to stay clear of him, but I was raised better than that. So, I offered to help him load up the boxes.
In the process of me helping him, it started to rain real hard and one of the boxes slipped out of my hand and crashing onto the ground. About fifty 'Tekken Tag Tournament 2' games scattered all over the wet ground. He told me that they were gifts for his family, but I could have one if I hurried to get them loaded so he could leave to get to his uncle's pawn shop before it closed.
I thought that was really nice of him and I was grateful that I didn't scorn him like everyone else.
My mother raised in a strict and righteous Christian household so I am not one to condone violence.
When I was in the youth seminary and choir, my advisor would let me come over to his apartment to play fighting games as long as I didn't tell my mom. She would of been furious if she knew about the games we would play.
The magic and fun in the games of a few years ago just cannot be found in today's fighting games. In his unusually warm apartment, my advisor often strip down into minimal fighting clothing like the games. He would spend hours alone with me demonstrating various holding and wrestling moves.  We would get so swearty. Sadly, those days with my attentive advisor and I are now gone.
Classic characters like Sagat, Chun-Li or Scorpion are not in this game. Seems to me that the developers are deliberately trying to alienate their audience.
This is not a game that  I would recommend due to its limited and downright dull roster. Unfortunately, the new guy from work never came back or I would of politely returned the game."

plus, how do you do a barrel roll with aiden?

And this one is no different: the same predictable look that you've seen done a hundred times so far.

. . . which leaves the gameplay, which isn't compelling.

Here's a example of what I mean:  I played about halfway through this game and then had to leave on vacation.  In other words, I was interrupted mid-way.

When I came back, I was surprised to find it in my PS console.  I had totally forgotten I had been playing it.

That shouldn't happen with a video game.  A good game should compel you -- even haunt you -- while you're on vacation.

This one is really just a bunch of annoying timed and jumping puzzles.  It's like the creators had no other ideas than to do what we've all seen a jillion times before and we're all sick of.

Worse, the game makes you pay for all these weapons and then has it so they don't affect most monsters.

The creator of this game, American McGee, is a drooling idiot who needs to be restrained . . . and then flogged."

56202,1,"Rarely am I compelled to stop what I am doing and write a review about a product. However, this product is such garbage, that I felt that need. In fact, it should receive no stars.

First, the game can only be used with certain video cards, which is something I did not learn until after I received the product. Specifically, it can only be used with a GeForce 1/2/3/4/FX or an ATI 7500-9000 series graphics processor. Now keep in nind, I meet those specs anway.

Second, you need the 1st CD (of 3) to play the game. Although not normally a problem, if you have an ultraportable or tablet PC, forget about this product.

Third, the installation is over 540mb minimum install. Thats if you do not install anything but just the pure game files.

After installing, I rebooted my Dell 8300 (2gb Ram P4 3.0, 400gb hard drive, ATI Graphics card with 256mb RAM on board). I started the program, and it locked up my computer. Tried again, no luck. Rebooted and tried opening the program, it finally opened. However, all the graphics were off.

Long story short, this game should be taken off the market and the development team put out on the street.

ALL I WANT TO DO IS PLAY CHESS!!!!!! DO NOT BUY! SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION!"

I was hoping the first expansion or update to spore would provide some more in-depth gameplay. I thought EA should release something to make the game worth its original price.

When I first started playing my Collectors Edition TPP, I was having lots of fun. Four star worthy at best, because while it was fun, the storytelling was a lot less solid than any previous Metal Gear, and the gameplay was so different that it felt alien to MGS.
About 60 hours in is when I started to really dislike this game. The graphics were all well and good, and while the game was getting pretty redundant for all the features it contained, plot flaws kept popping up like breeding rabbits. The continuity line of Metal Gear Solid started to break.
81 hours in, I finished a special mission with Quiet, and that mission bred more plot flaws. The game became a real grind to achieve the ""True"" ending.
91 hours in, finally achieve the true ending. And let me just say, as a huge fan of this series, with every MG and MGS game owned as well as patches, shirts, and a little Solid Snake Clayboy, it was a real kick in the pants. I am certaintly not the only fan of this series who was hurt by this ending. Kojima retconned the entire series, and the only untainted characters are Solid Snake and Otacon. I felt very downtrodden, and tempted to throw my stupid Collectors Edition cardboard ""leather"" box out into the night.
I feel cheated, and ripped off, and I feel like my favorite game series has just died within me.

198175,1,"The graphics are good, the levels are 99% bottomless pits with rotating blocks or flying turtles to jump on which gets tired very quickly.  The save feature sucks and sometimes you will beat endless pit levels get tons of stars for star world only to find that it didn't save and you have to start over.  It only saves if you beat an entire world or you manually do it which is total bs.  The multiplayer is the worst I have ever seen in any game ever.  It's a total mess, virtually unplayable with more than two players and even then it's super frustrating because players can cut each others jumps short when jumping at the same time, jump on other players heads driving them into pits, pushing each other off ledges, hit each other with items, kill the other players if you run ahead of them even slightly, die if the other players run ahead or are too far behind you, glitch kill the other players if anyone dies as it freezes all other players for a second if one dies.  If you freeze glitch near an enemy it's game over or if in mid jump it glitch drops you straight down.....hence killing you instantly as 99% of the levels with exception of level 1 world 1 are pits.  The multiplayer in this game is ""trip over the other players feet"" style which I hate just like Battletoads on NES.  For a simple Mario game the controls are mangled, unresponsive and sometimes have a damn mind of their own.  The layout is simple but the response time from the game doesn't match the buttons your pushing most of the time and you end up dead. I have still yet to figure out if the game was made this way or not.  The sliding around, the delayed or no jump sometimes when you hit jump while running and terrible hit detection combined with the 99% pit levels is maddening at times.  I fail to see how this game is for kids, if more than one is playing this at the same time they will probally choke eachother...even single player is to difficult for kids with all the precision pit jumping required.  The cut scenes could have been so much better and actually have effort put into them rather then having the same exact scene 12 times when you beat castles.  I have beaten the game from start to finish worlds 1-9 three times over and overall it was a frustrating as hell experience due to the games horrid controls, mangled hit detection, tired endless pit levels and savagely crippled multiplayer.  The lack of innovation here also took away from this game as it is a carbon copy of New Super Mario Bros DS.

Update:  They just re-released this game with a new Racoon power up on the Wii U.  The game is titled ""New"" Super Mario Bros U, if they are going to keep doing re-hashes they should just call it ""New"" Super Mario Bros Recycled, it's a far more honest and fitting title if they are charging 60+ dollars for this game everytime they release it over and over again."

277711,1,"What can I say, but in my opinion these headsets are crap.

I really had high hopes for this wireless device. Most of my pro-gamers I watch stream promote the A40 so I figured I'd give these wireless versions a shot. My first Astro Gaming product. I game on PC, xbox & Playstation so this model seemed like the most versatile version.

1st shipment from amazon came quick and setup was somewhat of a breeze. there is noticeable delay and lag when the receiver turns off to when the headset recognizes it. also when you unplug the charging for the headset there is great delay before the status light recognizes this. that's really no biggie but annoying when dealing with a wireless device with no cues other than that status light.

Either way, 4 days later I have absolutely NO sound when connecting on one of my consoles. I troubleshot for some time. connecting, disconnecting, messing with the volume, with the console settings, with the side earpiece volume setting. NOTHING. Finally after close to an hour i realized that the side earpiece area that allows you to lower the volume of voice or increase the volume of game is not working as expected. setting the earpiece to more game volume was actually MUTING the sound and the reverse was true. that function had reversed

Contacted support and after a few days they admit this is not normal and have no clue how to fix. Returned to Amazon (with no problems of course. Thank you amazon!)

2nd shipment got here yesterday from Amazon and again setup and updated firmware with no problems. When all of a sudden SOUND is lost, this time on my 2nd console. Tried on my other console SAME THING! But this time it has nothing to do with the sir earpiece voice/game volume. Now the red light stays solid on the headset. Even after you've turned off the receiver. I've even disconnected the receiver and held down the power button on the headset for 10, 15 minutes but NOTHING would turn it off. It's behaving like it has a hard error. I had to let the battery die down before charging it up and trying again. Happened AGAIN today. I'm typing this starring at a solid red light on the headset. A NON functional headset that is. I tried connecting it to my PC to see if I could re-firmware it and hard reset it but the PC can't recognize it. As long as a solid red light is on it will do absolutely nothing like it's in a hard error state.

I contact support but just realized now; do I really have to go through this on a $300 product that is NEW??? I don't think so.

After trying 2 copies of this product I believe I'm done with this. In my opinion & short experience the hardware on these headsets are not good at all!!"
293147,1,"I'm a very casual gamer, and bought Watch Dogs well after it had come out.  Based on what I read about the gameplay and the concept, I thought I'd love it.  Instead, I hated it so much I barely got through the first two hours of it.  I turned it off, ejected the disc, and traded it in.
The graphics are pretty shoddy in this day and age.  Hacking seems cool at first, but really all it consists of is pressing a button.  You can hack almost anything in the game, which quickly devolves into an odd sort of information overload, with the hackable device indicator popping up with every person walking by.  The driving mechanics are absolutely terrible, and it makes controlling vehicles an annoying chore.  On top of all that, the protagonist just isn't likable and is a very flat character.  I didn't read up on the ending, and I don't know how the story plays out in the game, but you quickly learn that the guy is mad because he hacked someone's bank account and that guy sent some baddies after him in return, killing his niece in the process.  Well, you started it bro."

185443,1,"I wanted to like Need for Speed: Shift, I really did.  As with other games I've recently purchased, my Thrustmaster Ferrari 5-in-1 was not recognized after the game was loaded on a Lenovo Pentium dual core computer with a 3.something processor.  The test car that was going to measure my skills sat on the side of the track in the grass with a running motor.  I then went back to the Main Menu options, chose edit for each control box, and steered the wheel, pressed the pedals, and pressed the buttons of the Thrustmaster to have the settings necessary to operate my wheel recognized.  Returning to the race screen, I was now looking forward to the test lap.  Well, the car was on the track, but it wouldn't stay there--unsafe at any speed!  I then returned to the Main Menu and chose ""adjust options.""  I saw that the steering sensitivity had been set to 25% and switched that to 100%.  Returning to the game screen, I was now able to stay on the track at about five miles an hour on a zig-zag course.  After again returning to adjust options and trying a couple more steering changes with no apparent result, I packed the Need for Speed: Shift, or an alternative title might be Need for Big Improvement in the Software: Hassle! back in the Amazon box.  How do I know it was the software?  Because, the wheel works great with the other game I bought called GTR Evolution.  My suggestion would be for the Electronic Arts company to get together with the Simbin company.  It gets on the nerves, after awhile, to listen to the extensive narrative regarding the approaching great opportunity.  They even repeat the same exact verbage twice in case the buyer missed it the first time. And, you have to listen to it all each time a change is made in the options. In summary, not a lot of fun playing the game or standing in line at the Post Office to return it!"
102846,1,"I did nothing when it tried to intensify or perpetuate interventionism. But its latest ventures are the straw that breaks the camel's back. Before I launch into my rant, permit me the prelude caveat that its loyalists are tools. Like a hammer or an axe, they are not inherently evil or destructive. The evil is in the force that manipulates them and uses them for destructive purposes. That evil is Microsoft, who wants nothing less than to confiscate other people's rightful earnings. Let me quote to you from the words of my attorney: ""Microsoft truly needs to stop living in a fool's paradise."" I like to think I'm a reasonable person, but you just can't reason with hideous psychics. It's been tried. They don't understand, they can't understand, they don't want to understand, and they will die without understanding why all we want is for them not to spam the Internet with unsolicited testy e-mail.

191156,1,"This item has always been a problem. While it is a nice feature that you can charge the remote through the glove, the bigger problem is how small the amount of space you have to charge on is. What I mean by this is there is an outline on the charger where your remote has to be exactly on. if it is NOT on that spot it will not charge and give you an error. So if you don't have great light this is a serious problem. Also many times when you put 2 remotes on the charger it flips out the other side of the charger and causes problems. So you spend more time trying to get them both charging then you do playing the wii.

I am shocked how poorly this product was made. I am a pro gamer and honestly would never suggest this product to anyone. I am already looking for a replacement for this type of product and will tell everyone I know who is buying this type of item to avoid at all cost.

Many of the games have emulation issues-the most common being flaky control and a distorted aspect ratio (many of the games get stretched to fill more of the PSP's wide screen).  But the real problem is just that these games haven't held up well.  I got some enjoyment out of Rampage 15, 20 years ago, but it's incredibly repetitive by today's standards.  You've seen everything there is to see within the first minute or two.  The same is true of most of these games.  Even Gauntlet seems boring 20 years later-I'd rather play the more recent update to the series-or better still something like Diablo and its clones.

The Mortal Kombat games at least LOOK pretty good, but lack any kind of extras you'd normally associate with a home game.  They don't even include move lists.  (And that's aside from the fact they didn't play as well as the Street Fighter games to begin with, and the passage of time has only made them feel staler.)

If you're a huge fan of these games already, and don't mind some emulation issues, you'll probably enjoy this disc.  For most people though I'd recommend skipping this and picking up a modern game, or waiting for Capcom's Collection for the PSP."
463800,1,"Oh how I wish I could rate this game higher. The atmosphere is incredibly good. Unfortunately, that is the only thing good about it. Otherwise, it's a trial and error, save, load, save, load, loop of aggravation. Wrong door, load, try again. Not fast enough, load, try again. Which of the three paths ahead leads to success? Guess until you get it right and then move on. This is my pet peeve with all video games. When they rely on giving you unlimited continues and turn it into a guessing game, that is less about skill and more about luck, it completely drains engagement from the experience, leaving you with no depth, no suspension of disbelief, and certainly no suspense. You go from tension to repetition and repetition kills tension. You get the feeling that you've done this before, because you just have, a dozen times over to finally move on. You're just struggling to give it the one and only solution, in the one and only way that it will accept as correct to get to the next cut scene. There is enough of jumping through hoops in real life without having to turn a video game into work. It takes a lot of hard work to make a game that is open-ended, the more it is, the more it tends toward buggy behavior (I encountered no bugs in the few hours I played the game), but a lot of hard work is supposed to be what we're buying, instead of cut corners. There is a ton of potential here, but it falls hopelessly short.
The healing system is unrealistic, yet had some potential, due to its depth.
You try to take your time and enjoy it and instead of excitement, you end up with grating, mind-numbing, boredom.

Shame on you.  I thought you had learned better by now.  I am over 50 years old and like to play active games and I know a lot of people my age who paid good money for our Wii so that we could play active games.  What were you thinking.

180250,1,"The title of this post should pretty much say it all:  This is a BAD GAME.  Many reviewers are noticing the rampant glitches in this year's version--many more than were in MLB 2K8, which wasn't all that smoothly done in the first place--and what they are reporting is accurate if, perhaps, understated.  In terms of its programming, this game is a disaster.  And the baseball action (fielding mechanics, pitching, etc) make it seem like there probably isn't a single actual baseball fan employed in the 2K studios.  Had a chance to check out The Show 09 on my buddies PS3, far--far--better.

So my solution is simple--don't buy this game.  If you did buy it, return it to the store immediately.  It'll be disappointing not having a new baseball game this year, but maybe if everyone leaves this dog on the shelf either MLB properties will reconsider and send the license back to EA, or 2K will fire their entire design team and start over.  At this point, either solution would likely result in a major improvement.

EDIT

I've talked this over with a number of friends, and we all agree--the enforced yearly output for sports video game franchises is killing the quality of the games.  There is, literally, no time for major innovation, good quality control, etc.  We've all agreed the following solution would work and hope you agree:  Put out a new title once every two or even three years--offering downloadable ($) roster and rating updates for each new season between generations of the game.  Giving these studios more time to focus on quality and innovation would probably lead to increased game sales.  I did not purchase MLB 2K9 this year, choosing to rent it first instead since I was disappointed with the last two or three iterations of the franchise .  And, needless to say, won't be buying it.  I will be doing the same thing with Madden as well.  Use the power of your pocketbook, rent these games for a few days before u purchase them.  It will save u both money and time, and maybe the sports game companies will wake up and smell the new century."
254560,1,"UPDATE 08/24/13:
After months of letting this sit, I decided to try again. I downloaded all the drivers and firmware, but nothing. When I plug it in, my computer notifies me that a device has been entered in one of the USB ports, but the Recon3D doesn't light up. I doubt it's the Tactic Link card in it.
I downloaded Creative's updater, and it recognizes the device when it's plugged in, but the update constantly fails. It's a shame because I loved it when it worked. Now it's a paperweight.

Also, I never heard back from Creative after my last email earlier this year.

UPDATE 04/21/13:
DEAD!
My Recon3D is dead. Or, at least, it won't turn on when connected to either my Mac or Windows computers. It's strange, because my computer will recognize when it's plugged in as any sound will try and shoot to the device, but since the actual Recon3D itself won't light up (ie, turn on), it can't connect to my Omega headphones, thus defeating the purpose.
I've emailed Creative to see what the issue could be.

UPDATE 12/13/11:
I've kept the original review below. It turns out I was missing the card, but Creative was gracious enough to send it to me so I can experience the full sound explosion in its glory. As a company, they rock. Their products are amazing, albeit overpriced.

Pairing the Omega headphones with their Recon3D was easy with the TacticLink (though I did have trouble at first), and the sounds is fantastic. I tested Star Wars on Blu-ray, and, sure enough, there was a huge difference from just using the Recon3D with $20 Sennheisers. Not only do the headphones make a difference, but the Recon3D does a magnificent job of imitating true THX sound. Having the Recon3D, it eliminates the cords from the Omega connecting to the TV and PS3. You only need to connect the Recon3D via USB to the PS3 and the optical cable (included) from the PS3 to the TV, and that's it. The Omega headphones sit comfortably on their rest, no other cords, pucks, plugs necessary.

It's fantastic for console gaming, but at $300 for both, it's too pricey, considering that you can find some with slightly less sound quality for under $100. While it's multi-platform (though I've only used it with the PS3 and Macbook Pro), the price can detract some, but the sound quality makes it worth it.

----------

Shouldn't it be the opposite? I have Creative's Tactic 3D Omega headphones, and got the Recon 3D to pair with it. It should be easier, shouldn't it? With their own products?
Unfortunately, that isn't the case.

While I have praised the Recon3D, that's only because I'm using them with my $20 Sennheisers. That's where the two stars come. It gets docked enormously for the fact that Creative leaves out the TacticLink, a piece that is REQUIRED to pair their own headphones wirelessly. Unfortunately, the two items separately do not come with the TacticLink, but the bundle does--? If you buy the bundle, you save over $75, but it comes with a component that you need to pair the items. You can pair the headphones with the Recon3D, but by cable only, and I don't have the necessary cable to accomplish that.

Therefore, their pricing is extremely skewed, and the fact that you have to pay over $75 more for both items separately when you don't even get the necessary (""optional,"" as Creative says) component to get the full, wireless experience, make this customer a very unhappy one. Heck, I can't even get the full experience at all because the Tactic 3D Omega can't connect to the Recon3D unless I go out and buy the cable, let alone ""optional"" TacticLink, thus leaving me behind the full enjoying experience.

It's a shame because I defended the Omega in another review, but here's where it stops."

I was stuck underneath the map multiple times.  Glitched behind walls and the framerate was horrible.  It has a horrible menu interface that looks like something from 1998.  Crafting items is a great idea, but when you are using an outdated interface, you really don't want to bother.  There are better games out there that are better like Oblivion, Risen, and Risen 2.

411685,1,"I had been so hype for this game for so long. The potential, endless with a massive universe of billions of worlds to explore and a game so vast you can't see it all in a lifetime.

Sounds great. And then you start playing it, and it takes only an hour to realize you are playing an incomplete indie game. How did this get so much hype? Where are these accolades coming from?? I'm pretty easy going and like most games and most styles. This game is sort of like Minecraft minus the craft. You collect things until your inventory fills up, which doesn't take long at all. There are numerous glitches and exploits which make collecting credits a taskless breeze, and even the ""police"" sentinels are easy to overtake (by the way, why are there already ""man made"" items and buildings on these planets, and cops, if they're all ""undiscovered""??). The flying is awkward and horrible, in space and in atmosphere (which is no different in the controls either...aerodynamics? inertia? these things don't matter). You can't even land the ship yourself and have to use an awkward autoland system. Gravity? Seems to have an influence on you...and it's the same on every world...but not local animals or even rocks (they just float there minecraft style).

I've got about 10 hours on the game at the time of writing this review, hoping with each minute I find something, anything, or a game dynamic, that redeems this horrible waste. I've been to 3 systems, 10 planets, and 2 space stations. Everyone one, full of identical buildings, same stuff, different colors. A massive station in space with only 2 rooms. The flavor text on every conversation and temple/monolith I visit is a joke, while it isn't intended to be (frozen gas? FROZEN GAS? STATES OF MATTER ANYONE??). This game is clearly a circlejerk for the devs at Hello Games, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at full price. All in all, I am not sure what these people are doing saying this game is amazing? The universe is ""infinite"" but with only 5 or so tasks to perform repetitively and really no immersion at all it feels pathetically small. Games like Grand Theft Auto and Witcher 3 feel so so much larger, richer, and fuller than this game even comes close to.

Extremely dissapointed."
78601,1,"This game looked good.  Some of the reviews were great.  I was hyped about the game, the premise, and what it promised to offer.  However, I could NOT get the thing to run!!!

I'm very computer proficient and play a TON of computer games, so troubleshooting is not something that really phases me.  Let me just say that I have NEVER had the experience of 1) not being able to get a game to run or 2) having as many problems with tech support as I did with aspyr.

Here's my experience...

--I've loaded the game on 4 different computers with no success (one of them a brand new Alienware computer).

--I've even tried completely re-installing windows XP, and still the game would not run on a ""clean"" system.

--Initially tech support said they couldn't help me and pawned me off to their licensing company...who said that they don't do tech support and said I needed to talk with Aspyr.

--Aspyr said that I should just patch the product and it would work fine.  When I said I already did that (under multiple tries), they said to try it again.... *Sigh*

--I've read on some boards that XP service pack 2 can mess up the game.  I suggested that to support but they flat out denied it.  I then installed XP (with SP2) onto a formatted computer...and again the game would not run.

All in all, I SERIOUSLY doubt I would try another one of their games.  Even if it worked, their support stinks to high heaven.

Stay away.  Stay faaaaaar away."

127443,1,"With all the hype I thought this game would be something special, what it turned out to be was a thankfully short, boring stinker. The story was lame and the action tedious and redundant. Also a few years before the game was actually released all the previews were totally different, there were images a cloaked baddies, and a totally interactive environment. This game feels like it started out as a huge sprawling sandbox action/adventure/horror/mystery then due to budget cuts ended up a lame shooter.

Graphics -
+ Nice, environments were very detailed
- Environments all looked the same.

Combat
Innovative system of breaking down enemy shields with a flash light then shooting them to kill them. Cool at first, gets old real fast.

Game-play -
This game consists of going from point a to point b and getting to a plot point then repeat. There are 3 types of enemies, and a couple of unimaginative bosses (a back-hoe for example). The environments while nicely detailed all look the same, with little to no thought in the level design, often you just head in a straight line through a generic forest, a generic building, or a generic office. The is combat fun at first, but once the novelty wears off (about 15-20 minutes) it get's boring. what makes matters worse is the cheap shots the enemies take. You'll find yourself just walking along or worse, fighting off a horde of baddies, when all of a sudden they start spawning right behind you, basically right on top of you. This happens so often and becomes so damn frustrating that you'll be tempted to quit, not due to the challenge but due to the fact that the game just isn't fun enough t keep you caring. I finished the game in a day, yeah it's that short, and that easy (minus the cheap shots.)

Re-Playability -
None, getting through this stinker once is a test of will-power

Verdict -
Possible rental, if it's cheap, or borrow it from an unfortunate friend who got taken in by the slick packaging. You shouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for this, if you are really, really curious though."
228347,1,"By now, I think most of the people reading this review will have already played Rayman 2. That being the case, not much of Rayman 3D will be a surprise, but that's not why you were looking at this game. You wanted to play one of the best platformers ever made, with all the rich level design, great musical score, and of course, the platforming, as well as the action you expect. Of course you expect that, because this is an adaptation of Rayman 2 for the dreamcast, regarded as one of the best ports of this game (of which there are many, but that's for another discussion)!

So, how can you go wrong? You already know this game. You know it's great, and now you'll know what it's like to play it with enhanced graphics, 3D, and portability, without any compromise to quality like in Rayman DS, or with the somewhat lessened quality of the PS1 port which is now available to play on PS3, PS Vita, and PSP. I'm sure most of you currently know how sarcastic I'm being, because this 3DS port is not nearly as flawless as one would think.

The things that ruin this game probably sound nitpicky to an outsider. Even I tried to resolve to deal with the negative because of how much I love Rayman 2. The fact of the matter is, most of them are technical. Rayman 2 is still a great game, and you can experience the PC version for reasonably cheap. But on the 3DS, Rayman 2 looks a little broken. Not much like its normal self, this version of Rayman 2 is full of glitches, framerate issues, even things as small as sound issues. Anyone who has played the original game at length would immediately spot these problems.

Let me describe to you an experience I had just moments ago. I was just playing the second level of the game, The Fairy Glade as it's called. The first thing I notice is that in the starting area, the framerate is all over the place. From silky smooth to what I'd have to guess is 15fps. If you don't know what that means, just trust me, it's not good. After progressing a bit, I come upon a giant machine pumping sludge into a river. I climb up into this machine and walk through it like normal, like in the original game, but something is off. Upon further examination, it turned out that most of the inner walls of this machine were invisible from the inside. If you go to first person view mode from within and look outward, the entire thing disappears and you can see parts of the map you were never supposed to. After marveling at the lack of playtesting, I moved along to another area with a large waterfall, another river, vines along a cliff side, and jumping pirhannas. Remarkably, this area seems relatively okay except for the framerate being kinda slow. As I make it to the other side safely, I peer back over to the vines I had just climbed across and notice that one of the pirhannas is frozen in mid air. Actually, I don't recall there ever being a pirhanna there to begin with. Just a random one, floating, completely still, like someone edited it in and forgot to delete it. At about this point, I turned off the game because I was disgusted.

There are numerous other glitches. In one level, you look upward and see that there are two skies. One of them is not supposed to be there, the other, clipped off at the cliff side for some reason. In another level, you free your friend ""Ssssam"" from a cage, but strangely enough, there are two of them! One of them is a fake, the other one can be used to traverse the level like normal. In some areas, in 3D, you can actually see through walls and such. Then there are less cosmetic issues. In The Iron Hills, you start out in an area that is downpouring so hard that it's effecting all the 2D objects in the area! Your shadow, your hair, lums, smoke, all sorts of things are barely visible because every raindrop that intersects them makes it disappear. If you like hunting for lums in that area, you'll only be slightly worse off finding them with your eyes closed. Speaking of which, this brings me to one glitch I haven't even encountered but everyone has talked about. The 1000th lum glitch! Apparently, there's a secret area in the game where you can find the very last, 1000th lum, but unfortunately, the method you use to get to it in the normal versions of the game is broken in this one. It involves a web hammock that you use as a trampoline, except, it doesn't bounce you at all, it just pretends like it's a platform. This makes getting to the lum almost impossible, unless you do some kind of convoluted technique of getting shot by an enemy or something, which hopefully bounces you high enough to get up to the ledge you need to get to to snag the lum. So, great, you can't even really beat the game by collecting all the lums. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the audio is screwed up too. Unless you turn your music down to about 10%, good luck hearing sound effects even when they're on max. Other issues I've heard of include music switching abruptly, some dialogue not being spoken or spoken strangely or out of sync, etc. I can go on listing off glitches, but I think you get the point.

Basically, Rayman 3D is a bad port of an awesome game, and doesn't deserve this treatment. If you want to play the real Rayman 2, it's available on GOG for less than $10, with some bonus content, and it plays natively in HD (and still looks surprisingly good at 1080p). If you have any computer that's less than 5 years old, I can almost guarantee you it'll run great, and older computers will probably perform just as well too. If you still have a Dreamcast, try and find that version of the game, because people love it and it's got some neat little extras that the PS1, PC, and N64 versions didn't have. This version just isn't worth your money, and no matter how many dimensions they add, it'll still be a terrible port."

The Play it Loud accesory doesn't increase the volume of your 3DS even though it uses 2 AAA batteries, and because the speakers are located so low the perception of the sound is very bad, the 3DS speakers are far better.
As for the screen protectors the top one is extremely small, it only covers the screen so its impossible to align properly.

122531,1,"I have a hard time recamending this system. First off I,ve only brought about 5 games for my ps3 2 of witch I never played. between the other 3 Hevenly sword, folklore, and valkyria I dought I have 100 gaming hours on my disc drive. and its already failed. It no longer spins. I have only watched 2 blue rays and 1 dvd (twice). Thats not acceptable. thus the 1 star

  I barrly used it since I,m always on my xbox core system. first gen. release, and yes 30 plus games latter 100+ hours just on soul calibur its still woking fine.

Things i didn't like about my ps3 b4 it broke.

6 axis control

playstaion network and store. (adopted xbox first and even tho free psn cant even be compaierd to the quallity of xbox live) xbox live is definatly the better choice for social gaming.

few exlusive titles of intrest. I brought mine for FF13 and blue-ray and ended up bying FF13 for xbox after sony lost the excusive

The trophies. copies of achivments on xbox aren't as easy to view and didn't catch my intrest.

Things i did like.

The playstaion controller has a better d pad.

The blue ray was able to play a dvd that skipped on all my dvd players the day it came out of box ( the burn looked wavy think it was skipping during burn).

Exlusive games like hevenly sword almost made it worth bying.

The blue-ray ps3 at the time was cheaper then blue-ray players. but alass that is the part that failed in 100 hours.

In all its not a bad system its getting to point were its got the games. but the 40 and 60 gig modles have hardware problems. If you havn't injoyed xbox live you wount know what your missing on psn, but if you get a ps3 get the new slim or 80 gig. they seem to not have the blue-ray lazer and moter fail problems."
225480,1,"The game is great. Except that I cannot save my games because everytime I login to Windows Live it says my product key is invalid. Amazon has been little to no help after 15 days of not being able to use my game I purchased from them. They won't even refund it. So basically they told me they don't know what to do. They just ""sell the game"", apparently that gives them no responsibility as a retailer to serve their customers. Let alone a couple day's after I paid $15.00 for the game it goes down to $10.00. Can't even through me the $5.00 difference. This is the first time I had trouble with a product from them. I shop on here a lot but after this I'm not buying from here again and closing my account. What good is it to buy from someone who doesn't back what they sell?"
297542,1,"If you are a Call of Duty Player looking for more with a few differences I would try one of the free Battlefield games out there first, or wait for Bad Comapny of BF 3 to go on sale Those Battlefield games are nearly identical to BF4, so playing them will give you an idea if you are going to like BF4.  (EDIT: The wording on this did not make sense I changed it.)

If you did not like Battlefield: Bad Company 2 or Battlefield 3 this game is no different. Just a Graphical update and some new maps.

With that said I am running the Game on Ultra, and though in screen shots the difference between BF3 and BF4 looks awesome.. In the actual game I often forget I am playing BF4. The graphics simply do not look any different when in the midst of battle.  Black Ops 2 Still looks MUCH better in most areas of game play. BF3 and BF 4 do look better when you are looking out at a vista. But that is a matter of opinion.

As of this review the game is 100% not noob friendly. Everyone in the game after 10 hours of multi-player is a crack shot and will snipe you from all over the map on all of the maps. In fact I have not played a single game in the past 24 hours where each team was not apparently 80% snipers.

Spawn camping (getting killed the moment the level loads) Is extremely bad in the game. A few maps are worse than others, but for the most part every single map design allows for you to be shpot in the head before you are even done loading into the game.

Also my experiences with Amazon Customer Service and Origin Customer Service have been less than ideal. I have been trying to trurn the game with multiple calls to amazon and Origin and neither will budge. I understand that it is not the norm to allow the return of games, but that needs to change. I will probably be making my next game purchase (CoD:Ghosts?) From Gamestop simply due to their very generous return policy.

Sorry for the Rant sounding review, but I just need to express my extreme disappointment with this title. I see more innovation in the yearly CoD titles than I see in the Battlefield series."
213787,1,"How can EA still be doing this to its customers?  How can you release a game and the online portion doesn't work for two weeks after the launch?  How lazy are they at EA that they don't even care about what the gaming community will think.

I would assume that Madden is EA cash cow, so they would take better care of it.  But Madden 12 sucks......bad.......real bad......and it's all EA's fault.

I just bought NHL 12 and it is great.  Not too buggy or glitchy runs fine online. Love it.  So how is it that the one game they should be focusing all their attention on is so horrible.  It is because EA knows we will buy it because it's Madden.  They have been using name recognition to sell this game for years, and haven't made any real progress in making the game better since it was released on the next-gen systems.  My hope is that everyone will stop buying this game every year and they will lose their licensing deal with the NFL.  Then we can have a real football game that doesn't suck so bad.

Death to EA Sports.....well at least the Madden department of EA Sports. You're gonna have to do better than this."

DR2 was monotonous, boring, controls were awkward.  It simply was not fun for me.  Others may like it.  My friend loves the creativity of combining weapons to kill zombies.

This game does require an initial activation using the Amazon Game and Software Downloader otherwise you can play the free trial for 30 days.  Fortunately you can uninstall the Amazon downloader and the game will run with out it.

75852,1,"A dramatic difference between this one and the others in the series. Though just about anything is better than GTA3, I have to say that this was was less interesting than Vice City. In this game there was more customization and bigger cities but that led to bigger glitches and more sluggish gameplay. Aiming system and driving physics were all greatly altered from vice City to this one. And all for the worse. I had some strange glitches in which I would enter a building to either customize hair or change clothes, whatever it was the character would never come out. Some kind of strange glitch which forced me to reload a previous save.
Overall I was highly dissapointed with the game when it was working and when it glitched. I say, if you liked GTA3 then play Vice City but stop there."

68926,1,"1. First for all the money you are spending sony couldn't even include a component or hdmi cable.

2. After closely comparing the PS3 to the XBOX 360 on several HD displays I've come to the conlusion that the XBOX 360 produces a much better picture.

3. BlueRay is slow slow slow; not to mention in my opinion the picture quality of HD-DVD is superior.

4. There is no rumble feature in the controller.

5. The PS3 motion senseing stuff really stinks.

6. It doesn't play quite a few of my ps2 games.

7. The unit did freeze up on me a few times.

After playing with this unit a comparing it side by side to the 360, I have come to the conclusion that this unit is simply not worth what sony is asking for it. I have also heard that developers have called the PS3 a disaster as far as its support to produce games for it.

Maybe after sony works out the bugs and soe more titles get released, this might be worth the money, but for now I would advise you to save your money or try a XBOX 360 or a wii.

I was going to send the unit back but a Sony Fanboy that I work with was willing to pay me what I payed for it.

Conlusion: Its simply not worth the money."
251044,1,"Yes, it's shovelware, but not worth $19.99 (the price I paid). I bought it for the tiltboard game, and thankfully that game works very well, and is fun.  Maybe, it's worth $9.99, but I wouldn't pay a penny more. The other reviewer pretty much said everything there is to say about the game in the excellent review. I'd like to add that I do like the setting of the game. It's very colorful and dreamy, but the games are pretty much straightforward boring and short. The 3-D atmospheres as the other reviewer mentioned simply just do not work.  Maybe someone can follow up this review in about 6 months and determine if it's worth $9.99. That would be interesting to see.

Pros:
using your avatar
cool setting
balancing board game which requires both arms (there is another version that requires one arm) The balancing board game in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Your-Shape-Fitness-Evolved-2012/dp/B0050SYUAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012</a>&nbsp;is better, although I thought this one would be better because of the 3 buckets on either side of the balancing board. You have very little control of where the shapes land.
tiltboard game (Majesco is onto something with this tiltboard game. This game works very well with the Kinect, and takes a lot of practice to tell your brain your left arm goes up and down, and your right arm goes left and right). I've played it for a couple of hours, and honestly is the best reason to buy this game. A stand alone XBLA title which may be slightly more elaborate would be great IMO.
Star Hop works well, and you'll probably have fun with this for 30 minutes or so until the novelty wears off.

Cons:
short games
annoying music
left and right conrols for Robo Drive
balancing board  game which requires one arm
Sack Hack (also having to use designated limb or head to keep balancing sacks with poor 3-D motion detection)
Crank It Up
Dodge Ball, which is an inferior version of the Kinect Adventures version.

Overall, this has 2 fun motion games, and the rest are boring, but that's just an opinion. If you're really into the tiltboard game as I am, this may be worth a purchase. I really can't recommend it otherwise.

Update: August 3, 2012: I actually threw this game in the garbage. I was so disgusted by even looking at it, thinking what else I could have done with the 20 buckaroos, and the time I wasted on playing this game.

I noticed that there are four options, all of different prices, to choose from, yet the reviews don't change when you select a different option, so I'm not sure if that somehow factors into it, as the working reviews may have bought a pricier option. As for me, I bought the ""Black"" color one, or the one that offers Prime shipping. If you bought one and had a working one, it would be cool to actually know what option you bought, since that might factor into it. Anyway, this one was a dud and I'm returning it.

Who really cares because we will get money from it and no one will be able to buy used games or rent games from a rental store."" Yep thats pretty much the design thought process that Sony had during this project...Oh and FYI you can still download all the same games on your ""old style"" PSP so the only thing better about this system is it's size and it has bluetooth...everything else is either a downgrade or remained the same.

And to unlock other game modes, you have to sing every song to unlock each mode on each song individually! How stupid is that? Usually when you unlock a mode it's available for every song! Not on here! You unlock each mode one by one for each song! Stupid game that could have been good because the songs on here are awesome! Its the game play and the game itself that sucks.

409172,1,"OK what the heck happen here this is not the Sony quality i was expecting but the remote is good but almost useless in a way.

Pros:
1) a decent remote that lets you control other devices (to a certain point i will get to that in the cons)
2) the feel of the remote and the button controls are well made
3) runs Netflix and PS4 Bluray player really good

Ok not the not so good about this remote

cons:
1) yes it lets you control other devices but it a total mess with the button function for example when you use the volume control on a TV it goes into the main menu instead when you press option button it changes the TV channel and I am using it on a Sony TV

2) volume punch through didn't work for me I tried the instruction and it a no go for me I really don't understand it I am using a Sony TV and a Sony remote why aren't they compatible ...

3) using the remote to watch Netflix and Hulu and other online media who ever thought of this while making the PS4 remote must like to torture people  it works fine on Netflix but for Hulu you can't even move the menu screen at all it just stay in one spot but you can exit from Hulu and that's it I also tried it with IGN and YouTube most of the functions don't really work

4) red light on remote is now constantly on after I set it up to work on my TV and Receiver I don't know why I tried taking out the battery's and putting them back in again also tried to check if there was a stuck button but that's not the case it can still be functional I used it on my PS4 and it works its just the red light is really annoying

5) Learning function is a joke i didn't work for me for some reason

well we waited for a long time for a PS4 Remote to come out but now I wish it didn't very disappointed with it.  I would not recommend this to anyone the PS3 Remote was 100 times better I just wished that they had kept the same format."

There is next to no innovation.  The graphics look like they were salvaged from Quake, the puzzles are of  the annoying ""find the panel that opens the door way the hell over  there and backtrack, etc"" style.  The sense of immersion is zero.  The  sounds are poorly choosen.  The enemies are, for the most part, utterly  uninspired.  The load times between segments (which uses the Half-Life  formula) are ridiculously long.  It's also utterly unstable and prone to  crashing at any given moment.
Well, you get the point.  If this were just  another generic first person shooter that was being sold from $20 on the  discount rack, maybe I wouldn't feel so annoyed.  As it was, I went back  and exchanged it for ""Soldier of Fortune"" which, well also not  ground breaking, is solidly entertaining and, at least, mildly  innovative.
Please, folks, don't get sucked in by the hype.  Save your  money for something better.  In the meanwhile, I'll be hoping that Ion  Storms next big product, Deus Ex, does a better job of living up to its  reputation."

The graphics and sounds are about 10 years behind the times, (Even for 2006, which is when this game came out).

I downloaded the version 1.8 patch and lost all of the profile files I had and there were no more challenges, just a blank screen and when I clicked on start, I'm in a field with grass and trees instead of a river. I think the patch is on crack!

239334,1,I'm new to Borderlands...never playing the first but with all the hype I thought I would try it. I normally play war shooters like Killzone 3 and Spec Ops. This game pales in comparison. The story is weak. Following around some annoying robot in the snow? But that's not the 2 worst things about the game. The worst is the Spawning and the lack of quick saves. I thought I could overcome that issue. Then I found out I can't even carry enough ammunition to make it through a battle with marauders. After about 5 tries at that I said enough is enough. What fun is a shooter when you constantly run out of bullets and are forced to sit there and just die! Ammunition needs to be readily available at all times. So in summary I played the game for about 3 hours total and traded it right back in after about a week. I would only recommended this game to someone with lots of time to kill. I'm not that guy. Casual gamers should avoid at all costs!

It took 15 minutes to start playing the game.  Really 15 minutes.  I timed it. Other reviews are right there are too many cut scenes and YES the game play is hard to use. I don't want to spend hours learning how to play the game correctly.  Here simple, this button is shoot, this button is change weapons, this button is targeting.  Why be more complicated than that?  1 and 2 controls were the best.  They have lost me here completely."

107434,1,"You know when I witnessed the local kids playing Resident Evil Code Veronica X you have no idea the level of dread I felt for the future of the series. These were kids who started playing the series once Code Veronica was ported form the DreamCast to the PS2 and instantly shunned the original Resident Evil games on the PlayStation (one of these kids, the leader of the idiot team of course was only one year younger than me).

Unfortunately, my dread became vivid and has stayed vivid onward. Resident Evil is never going to be the unique little adventurous, ultra gory, atmospheric little Alone in the Dark rip-off I remember it as because when a company considers three of the most broken, overly action packed, laughable additions to the series as 'essential,' then something is very wrong. The atmosphere that the Resident Evil that was introduced in 1996 (thirteen years ago) is NEVER coming back and it's all thanks to its so-called sequels that were almost entirely dedicated to nothing but action.

Seriously, look at what they have: Resident Evil Code Veronica X, the port of the all ready overly action packed jerk-fest with a John Woo gunslinging Leonardo Dicaprio dork and a one dimensional antagonist with the addition of a character who magically survived the previous games by a continuity error that was later explained in Umbrella Chronicles in that classic five year old ""because I said so"" excuse solely so said character could be the equivalent of The Terminator meets The Matrix.

Then there's Resident Evil Outbreak, the first online survival horror game ever made and quite  possibly the worst (second only to Outbreak file #2) with more of those random cameo characters the developers loved so much they had to include them in the game by snapping the continuity in pieces. Add to the broken single-player game play with some of the most obnoxious enemy AND friendly AI ever made and some of the most atrocious enemy designs made and you've got pain elemental in one game.

Then you've got EVERYONE's favorite blend of Hollywood action slop and campiness, 4resident evil (hey, that's literally how it's spelled), a game where the only fear you'll get is laughing yourself to death he moment you see the so called 'terrorists' you're fighting. I just need to ask: What are game developer's obsession with playing the role of alpha male in games? Does a game become an instant classic when you have a to baby sit a foxy young woman in loose clothes who can't defend herself, whose first lines are literally ""Don't come?"" I'm serious, that's the first line she has! You know what happened to games where you have to rescue a woman who screams those words at you??

The latter game proves one thing about our generation of horror gaming: If I ever need money and I know how to develop a game, I'll just rip off Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid, throw in some heads popping every time the character so much as breathes on them coupled with rag doll physics, have some pervert in an overcoat sell you nasty things you can fit on to your gun in exchange for illogical fetch-quests and mini-games, throw in maybe one or two monsters and have you defend a hot, foxy woman in an iron lung and call it a horror game. I'd make MILLIONS!!"

At least later you can flash transport from one area to another. The acting is horrible as well as the music soundtrack.  The storyline moves slowly, and I moved aimlessly around for the longest time before having to resort to obtaining a cheat. The game description sounded like it would be fun, but that has not been the case. This has been move like a travel site with lots of pretty pictures. I would not recommend this game but would like to visit Anacapri."
162274,1,"I'm starting this out with a bold statement.  I have been watching reviews and videos on this game since release day.  I've checked back every day.  But despite hundreds of reviews read and dozens of videos watched:  I have not played the game.

So WHY do I feel I can review this?  ANSWER:  The server issues alone are enough to give the game a 1 star at current time.  Some of those issue will improve, some will remain.  The game also happens to have issues outside this.  Issues agreed on by both sides.  I'll tackle those too.

Server issues:
1.  Servers being crap on launch week = Horrible, but forgivable.  Code limitations should have been ironed out in beta, and plenty of hardware should have been provided for launch.  Blizzard is NOT a poor indie company that randomly got massive unforseen demand.  Still, things happen.

2.  Servers being crap on the following week = WTF.  Again Code should have been stress tested and broken during beta.  If they didn't have enough servers a week gave them plenty of time to set up more.  Blizzard has the money, it just didn't want to spend it.

3.  Servers still having regular issues over 2 weeks following launch = No words for this.  Simply unacceptable for a company of its resources and the amount of development time/metrics they had for this.

4.  Cannot play single player offline.

5.  Server problems further destroy the single player experience.

6.  Great, now people are regularly getting hacked playing single player.  Bravo Blizzard.

Non-Server Issues:

7.  Character customization has been disintegrated.  While this offers a more flexible approach that streamlines and yes simplifies, it nonetheless robs a very important part of the game away from many people.  Also, that streamlining and the old issues could have been fixed within the old system easily.  This lowers replay.  Yes maybe YOU don't have an issue with this but people have spoken.  An overwhelming amount of people DO have an issue with this, minor or major.

8.  Items.  Diablo has always had a strong loot basing as well as being fun to play.  Unfortunately the loot distribution and balancing in Diablo 3 is broken atm.  Magic items are better than items of higher rarity because they have an inherently much higher dps.  Items also appear to be more rare in general by far.  This lower also replay.

9.  Auction House, for money.  That's ok, that's what the auction house is for right?  Oh, but ya, you're decent items will likely be selling for real world cash now.  At least, once it actually works reliably and they add real money.  So enjoy your poor itemization unless you want to pay.  Because even if you trade 1:1 value on the AH you'll lose 15%+ listing fee to blizzard.  Both sides will :).  Yay?

10.  Randomization is very limited:  While mobs randomize fairly well maps themselves randomize only minimally.  This leads to the same layout and very similar experience on additional runs through an area.  This is the 3rd thing that lowers replay.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.

11.  Linear.  With the game being linear your forced down a cattle chute constantly being hemmed in and guided in only X direction.  This inability to freely roam even further limits replay.  Combined with the simplified character customization, itemization, and randomization this is a killer that has many people already burning out.  People that would not burn out near as easily on this exact same game otherwise.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.

12. Graphics:  When most people including most 5 star reviews note that the graphics are last gen, I believe them.  This isn't as important to me but if graphics being lower than they should be for a game of this calibur bothers you than it's a big strike.

13.  Story:  I'm sorry again, most people even 5 star reviews saying the story is forgettable (if they are kind) and horrible (if they are mean) tells me that the story is simply lack luster.  I don't expect epicness in this day and age, but cheese factor and mismanagement of prominent characters is a no no.  Only certain genres like comic books and comedies can pull that off IF DONE RIGHT.

Overview:

Lets disregard the server issues as that would automatically fail this game as a consideration for purchase.  It's assumed these will, eventually (and apparently with the minimum money investment possible) be fixed.  Regardless it's UNFORGIVABLE for a company with the resources of Blizzard and with the testing time/metrics/sales predicitions they had at their disposal.

Is this a fun game from everything I know?  Yes.  Will it be worth playing after they get server issues lined out?  Yes.  Is it a AAA title or worth $60?  HECK NO!!  This is the level of polish, length, and quality that you should expect from an Indie developer just putting itself on the map and selling the game at $15-$20.  This is not the level of game expected of a company the size and notoriety of Blizzard.

You'd be way way better off spending your $60 on say, Fallout 1, 2, 3 and New Vegas.  Torchlight + Titan's Quest, and $20 left over for whatever you wish.  ETC.  There are way too many options to justify $60 on this game when you can make far far better use of your money elsewhere with far less frustration and likely more and longer fun."
411666,1,"[For a small (but ultimately personally inconsequential) correction and update to my review, skip to the bottom.]

<Original review>
I wasn't onboard the No Man's Sky hype train prior to release.  I preordered a few days before release date, practically on a whim, just so I could get it quickly and try it out.

Initially, I was very pleased with the game:  it felt like early-days Minecraft survival mode on a galactic scale, and I felt almost like I was returning home.  If I would have reviewed it during that honeymoon phase, I would have given it 4, perhaps 5 stars, with caveats.

Earlier this evening, after having put several hours of gameplay into the game every day since release, I was determined instead to leave a 3-star review, based on the fact that the game is so very buggy.  I've had far too many crashes to count.  I once had a crash loop that ended with me crashing 6 times before I could make any progress in the game, and one of those crashes was on the title screen.  Actually, I've now had two separate crashes while on the game's title screen--I wish I had something witty to say about that, but I don't, so I'll just repeat it:  this game has already crashed twice on the very first screen it opens to, mere seconds after launching.

But everything has changed yet again, and not for the better, hence my current one-star rating.  This game's save feature is very poor:  you can manually save only at certain types of beacons on planets, and otherwise you auto-save when exiting your ship.  This may sound like a good system on the surface, but it's fatally flawed.  You cannot have multiple save files, so if your one save file ever becomes corrupt, or is saved during a certain-death scenario, then it is really and truly game-over.  This is exactly what happened to me.  I landed on a planet, and somehow (unknown to me at the time) my ship landed just inside a mountain (outside of the playable map).  When I exited my ship, my one and only save file was automatically overwritten with my character falling inexorably to their death below the surface of the planet.  Even using my jetpack, I cannot get back above ground or into my ship.  Dying only causes me to (lose my entire inventory, and then) reload and experience the same thing over again.  Manually reloading my game-save (via closing the application and restarting), of course, merely puts me right back at the beginning of the slow, inevitable fall to my character's ultimate doom.

Other developers know their games are buggy, and they make concessions:  multiple save-files, staggered auto-saves, etc.  Bethesda comes to mind.  Not so with Hello Games--they couldn't be bothered to safeguard their players' character data whatsoever.

I am utterly baffled that this game was seemingly not play-tested to any appreciable degree, yet it somehow managed to pass Sony's certification process.  I really, really liked this game after I started playing it, despite all its flaws, despite what we now know to be half-truths (being generous) from the developers prior to release, and despite what inevitably would have become mind-numbing boredom given a few more tens of hours of gameplay.  But this is a completely unfinished, unpolished, and ultimately unplayable piece of software.  It's obvious, given what I did see and enjoy during my time with this game, that the developers have vision and talent--which makes it all the more depressing that none of that matters since they couldn't be bothered work out the bugs prior to shipping (and/or day-one patching) the game.

I'm not sure who I'm more disappointed with:  the developers themselves, or publisher Sony who is obviously complicit in this farce.  This is a full-priced console game, published by the console-maker:  things have obviously gotten very much out of hand.  Until this incident, I have never thought that the entire concept of preordering games might be fundamentally flawed, but now I am determined to be much more careful with my limited gaming funds.  I feel like I got burned on a failed Kickstarter project that was rushed out in an unfinished state.  So I advise anyone similarly concerned to do what I now plan on doing:
* Don't preorder games, full stop.
* Read reviews from all the major trustworthy gaming publications before making a purchase.
* Check reddit threads, Amazon user reviews, and--for high-profile releases--even news articles for mentions of major issues like crashing, bugs, game-ending flaws, etc.
* Wait for one or even two major patches (beyond any day-one patch) before pulling the trigger on that sweet new game.

I think it's time to move to PC gaming--if my game is going to crash every two hours, it might as well be crashing in glorious 1440p60.  ;-)

<end of Original review>

Edit:
""A customer"" commented about the multiple auto-saves.  This undocumented (since the game auto-loads your most recent save file from the title screen) feature of having precisely *one* previous save file (not two) does exist:  there are merely ""current"" and ""previous"" save files.  Evidently, upon death, yet another auto-save is triggered:  another bad design choice.  Since both saves are in the exact same spot, this does me no good.  Both my saves are in the exact same doomed location, but minutes apart.  There is no third save file.  My character is still completely unplayable."
245134,1,"Thousands of reviews have probably gone through with their own disdain as to why ME3 was such a disapointment but I would rather first talk about the good things vs the utterly horrible.

1. Great shooting -  Its not like ME2 where you could charge and shoot, you'll have to use cover and sometimes mild tactics in order to finish your missions. I don't think i didn't loathe one fire fight in any segment of the game. 4 Stars for action.

2. A realistic Shepard:  This time around, he's not really so clean and the choices aren't so open and shut. You even have to consider that Shepard him/herself is also suffering from PTSD as well as the many lives he's seen lost along with all of the death and destruction from  ME1 to ME2.  Mark Meer does the best peformance of Shepard to date, he seemed to be very engaged into the dialouge he expresses and it fits well with the mood and dark surrounding of ME3.

3. Graphics are always a plus, I don't think I'm so detailed that I woudl claim a huge difference, but the worried thoughts after people played the demo suggested it was going to be clumsy or somewhat unfinished looking... however I think they did a great job creating new enviorments both destroyed and maintained.

5. Lots of weapon vareity --- and although some were questionably useless, there was enough different upgrades to make you at least feel there was some upgrading/growing stronger as the player went along.

6. Flowing action --- great dialouge.  I heard some complain about the dialouge. Not too many wheeles per say. I didn't mind what I had, there wasn't  THAT much dialouge however... most likely because at the end of the day, unfortuantely, the more fast pased --- button smashing and less talk players grabbed EA's attention and therefore, we got served  Gears of Mass Effect. It is what it is.

7. Well lets see.....7....7.....

You know what?  Lets keep it at 6 because after all that, it doesn't practically matter at some point. The poor so called RPG has de-evolved into a cash pit for Multiplayer fans to shoot at eachother all day until they get bored and go back to MW, leaving the husk called Mass Effect as a laughable punch line at the bargain bin.  Why lie to you consumer? You'll end up a dollar short and a few hours less of your life, having put too much energy into a plot that never was going to finish correctly and an influence from  Big-V.

Just stay away from the game unless you can get it for 20.00 --- do your self a big favor.

I am not spoiling anything. If your just a casual gamer you may like it, if you are a hard core fan, you won't. And thats the bottom line.

1 star.  I don't need to add on to what was said, its all true in the end. All true.  Darn shame to fumble such a beautiful set of games but... what can I say, its a shooter's world these days. Most people want explosions, map packs, and numerals raising to what ever score you want to rant and rave about along with digital medals --OK --- hey what ever floats your boat but geez -- you have to bleed into everything these days?  I rest my case.

Could care less who doesn't like this post,  Mass Effect 3  is  Mass Deffect 3.  To each their own though, these are only my small opinions and you can do what ever you wish....

...but Bio Ware... you really did bad son...you really did bad.

The only thing left for one to do is to get killed by  Mauraduer Sheilds, now there is a Hero of Mass Effect --- he tries very well to help you out, if you take the hit, I suggest you leave it at that.

End.

190543,1,"Pros: Good graphics

Cons: Every possible thing you can think of that is not graphic related. Single player is short and a joke. It takes less than 5 hours of total game play on the hardest difficulty. There is no replay value like the first Modern Warfare provided. The online play is an absolute disaster. Every single online match is rampant with cheaters and connection problems. There is nothing you can do about a cheater. You can't ban cheaters or remove them from a game. If you are not the host of the game you can expect serious lag.

If I had purchased anything else for $60 and it performed like this product I would have received a full refund."
168153,1,"Like Mass Effect from EA before it (and unfortunately a number of other recent titles), EA has infected this with ""Activation"" DRM. They get your money, but you don't own a copy. You can only install/reinstall it if you have an internet connection, their server is running (it won't be forever), and you haven't installed it twice before (which you could end up doing just deciding what system to run it on).

Completely unacceptable. Buy games where you actually OWN a copy of the game after spending money."

223435,1,"I downloaded the demo of this game because I really enjoyed civilization revolution. Shortly after playing the game I realized how horrible it is. How can a city defend itself against enemy warriors by itself. Really in real life if a army attacks an undefended city they are captured and put into martial law. I attempted to destroy a city state at the begining of the game, and found it took a retarded amount of time. The minute I declared war on them the English began to defend them. With the crappy way they designed war I find the game takes way too long to play. I recommend everyone send the game back and kick whoever sold it to them in the junk."

213103,1,"This review is for the game functionality and not for the campaign. Yes, the campaign is great for Resistance 3. I have played all of the Resistance games and they have all been great. But I purchased this specifically for the online portion. You wouldn't think that if you buy a relatively recent game that the online portion would no longer work. You can only play the campaign so many times before you want to know where you stand amongst your fellow players. If you can't do that, then they have no business selling the product to unsuspecting customers like myself. Given that this game only came out only three years ago, and still on the shelves of many stores, Sony should not be shutting down its servers for this game. To purchase this game brand new and only to find that a major part of it is no longer functional is a total letdown. In an age where publishers such as Activision keep their servers running for games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops that came out four years ago and at the same time still serving the other Call of Duty games from Black Ops to Ghost this should not be. Sony with its deep pocket should be able to continue serving the Resistance community. They chose to go the in the wrong direction and follow businesses such as EA whose business practice has been to nickel and dime customers and give them less for their money. Producing a game such as Resistance 3 and then pulling the plug on the customers is simply, to put it short, bad business practice. As such, I will no longer be purchasing any more Resistance iterations ever again. I am sure that they will do the same to the Resistance 4 customers."

139741,1,"This headset is the ""old"" 2010 AX Pro (single power supply) model, it is not the new 2011 revision, that is shown in the main images on the left on Amazon's product page. I am awaiting information as to why it was miss-advertised, and if the new model that is depicted is available from Amazon. Will update the review with more information, as I get it. Will change rating/info depending on the product's availability, for now, I am treating the old revision as another incorrectly sent item. The main reason why I purchased the headset from amazon was due to the fact that I contacted Amazon rep's and received a confirmation that the product is the new 2011 revision, which has better headset cable quality, and a better sounding mic, and some other minor enhancements such as swivel speaker pieces (that the olde model did not have, and a inline controller that is more comfortable to use.

Update 21/12/2011:

Looks like Amazon removed the ""2011 model"" images, and replaced them with old ones, from the old series...

Update 1/25/2012:

Contacted Amazon reps again, regarding the fact that the previous rep never followed up on checking if the correct item is being sold, and I also saw the new model images on Amazon(after Amazon removed them and replaced them with old photos). I was told that the item sold is the old Tritton ax pro version, so looks like Amazon is still misrepresenting the item sold, since they still do not offer the new model of the headset that is depicted in the images. DO NOT BUY THE AX PRO FROM AMAZON if you want the new model! The rep wasted an hour of my time, and acted as if nothing happened, even though Amazon is advertising a product (directly sold by them) they do not carry."

This game, plain and simple, is UNPLAYABLE without a HDD (you CANNOT use a formatted memory stick for this) with at least 7.3GB of free space on it. If you have the 2GB, 4GB or original slim without an additional Microsoft branded hard drive, you CANNOT play this game. At all. The end.

This is simply pathetic on behalf of Electronic Arts. They're selling a product with absolutely no forward notice to an enormous percentage of Xbox 360 owners have no way of using this product. Both discs must be installed - there is no ""playing it in non-HD."" This is tantamount to selling a car that can only take diesel fuel without mentioning it to anyone until they open the gas flap to see a small ""diesel only"" sticker. Totally inexcusable.

This is twice in 6 months that I've spent $60+ on an EA game that was a complete and utter embarrassment to the entire tech world. NHL15 on the 360 was flat-out copy & pasted from NHL14. New rosters and a new announcer; other than that there's absolutely no way it should be it's own game.

EA's tech support doesn't speak English. Their website is completely unmanned and they laugh when people bring complaints to their knowledge. You cannot return video games once the seal has been broken so I'm going to sit here with my chocolate-covered thumb while their marketing teams put out false advertisements in commercials and stage misleading promotional campaigns.

The cover of this game says it's for Xbox 360. I own a 4GB Xbox 360 and it is unplayable. There is nothing else left to say."
357371,1,"As I write this on my laptop, I sit with some friends that run a major retail supply warehouse. We started playing this game yesterday and are still laughing our A**es off at how terrible this game is.

OK, this game is made by CI GAMES. In case you are not familiar with this group of brain dead development chimps, they are the very same short bus riders that brought you such sewer level classic compilations of vomit like -

FARM FRENZY
SNIPER GHOST WARRIOR
ALIEN RAGE

Yes, those despicable things. And they dare to make yet another.

Here are just some of the wonderful surprises waiting for you -

Completely mentally challenged enemy AI - they almost help kill themselves as you shoot them down.
Horrible video graphics quality. Think back about 10 years ago.
Terrible glitches - disappearing floors that let you see through the game level, weapons that vanish and it seems as though you are shooting bullets from your finger tips (sounds cool, I know but it isn't).
Bland, lifeless levels.
No depth of plot or story to pull you into it.
The FAIL list goes on and on.

You have been warned!"
284971,1,the gaming  controls are  horrible the counter moves and blocking moves are off. It makes the game less about skill and more about luck or randomness this games  will never be  better than  any  street fighter type of game
171618,1,"I've had nothing but problems with this game and/or the Motion Plus add-on when combined with the Nunchuk.  I'm at a loss here....  The games look like they could be fun, if only we could play them.

I have four controllers, and four motion plus add-ons, and three nunchuks.  (Obviously this limits us to three people for games that require the Nunchuk, which is fine.)  The problem is that only one of my Nunchuks works with the Motion Plus.  The other two work okay without the Motion Plus, and the Motion Pluses all work okay without the Nunchuks.  Combine them though, and only one works.  No good at all for three kids.  I've tried moving around the Motion Plus and Nunchuks, and it's very consistent."
232844,1,"I liked this game

Actually I love Nintendo and the Wii, but this game is the worst, not recommended and do not think it gives children a bad message"
279728,1,Not a new item this has been opened. Staples all along the edges And being sold as new. Not good.
299822,1,"so what's up with this Legacy bundle?

First off, I do not see any legacy attached to this.

If by legacy they mean slapping on old games to the console, then I suppose you can call it that.

The console is just a regular black ps3, they didn't even bother painting it or giving it a GT design.

This would be good for poor people, who have not been able to afford a ps3 til now."
369800,1,"Here is my checklist of features that games need to be playable:
- Pause. I am an adult. I have to fix my own food, get clean, shop, answer the phone. Adult stuff. Phone rings I can't whine, ""Mom, get the phone."" I am old and need to eat right, make meals, exercise, go to the dentist, use the bathroom etc, and sometimes NOW, not later. No pause, no play. This game has no pause.
- Fair respawn amount. You get tossed back to your ship after some few minutes of inactivity. You must rekill everything you just did before the phone rang. Some respawns are 10-20 minutes of refighting the same battle.
- Side missions to help you level up in case you are having a hard time with some enemy or other. In Destiny, you can redo old missions or go to an arena where Bill Nighy drones on about retaking area A or B.
Without a pause, no game is playable for me.
Sorry this didn't review the game. The mechanics were too bad to get beyond these points.
Borderlands, InFamous, Prototype have these things."
270656,1,"broken game, often hacked, and overrated mess. it's simply a camp fest for small minded gamers, terrible map design, boring"
292266,1,"Hi guys
To be honest this playstation camera is completely useless at the moment. No apps or games r using this device responsibly.
At first I thought this would be the sony kinect but if u see the hardware inside it's not comparable with kinect 2.0.
Ps4 is ok but this cam is useless."
348198,1,"Hate it. The gameplay changes ruin this game. You are supposed to be a badass assassin, but they've taken away all of your fighting prowess! No more counter kills, no more instant kills with smoke bombs, no more using your hidden blade in combat. They make it so difficult to fight in this game and what's worse is that they just load a ton of them on you in almost any encounter! The game is designed to force you to spend money to upgrade your equipment just so you can survive. Enemies deal an insane amount of damage, even weak ones! I've played every Assassin's Creed game and enjoyed them, but this, this is a piece of poop. I die so often, overwhelmed by enemies that you have to hit soooo many times (they love to block about 60-80% of your strikes) to kill. It is horrible! I don't feel like an assassin, what I feel is stupid for buying this game"
127795,1,"Save your money. I have tried to find something positive to say about this game but I can't. This has to be one of the worst games I have played in years (and I play them all). It is unimaginative, repetitive, quickly becomes boring and frustrating after you (and I am not exaggerating) do the same missions 30 times, climb the same towers 50+ times, see the same graphic cutaway 50+ times, save the same person in the crowd 30+ times, etc. Also you are not completely ""playing"" the game, every 15 minutes or so it cuts away to a poorly written hack story line that you are forced to sit through. The sad part is this had the potential to be something great open world design and fairly good graphics. To be perfectly honest I am bitter and angry that I spent 50 bucks on this garbage of a game. Ubisoft should be embarrassed of this release and fire the designers."
396667,1,"I finally played this today.  Spent years looking forward to it, ever since I heard the hint of a new Battlefront.  There's no story mode.  Or any substance in the slightest.  Its just fancy graphics, and versus mode.  Oh yeah, and there's store to buy different weapons.  This is basically any other online shooter game you've ever played, but star wars themed."
189505,1,"I received this and it didn't actually work on my New 3DS XL. The power light just flickered when it plugged in rather than charming like normal, and didn't actually charge the machine. I'll be returning it."
126519,1,"I will not pay $60 for one-third of a game, nor will I pay that for a game that has far less functionality than the original. Activision put its heart and soul into ruining Starcraft 2 and Blizzard, and they've clearly succeeded.

Sixty dollars for no LAN play, no chat rooms, pay-to-download DLC (remember when you could download maps for free in EVERY OTHER BLIZZARD RTS?), a bizarre friends system, and of course, one-third of the Starcraft 2 story with the promise of the other two in expansions. It's almost supernatural, how insulting it all is.

The best part is that Blizzard has said publicly that they're fine with all of it, that Activision hasn't limited them at all. I can't help but get the image that Activision execs were holding assault rifles to the Blizzard rep's head as he announced that.

Shameful."
55371,1,"The Wii will destroy the card at random.

All saves on the card will corrupt.  They will remain corrupt when moved to a 59 or a 251.  They remain corrupt when using the card on a REAL Gamecube.  The card remains corrupted when all saves on the card have been erased and new saves are started using ONLY a real Gamecube.

It's a $20 white brick.

The background:

I purchased this 1019 memory card when I bought my Wii.  I never had a Gamecube, so I thought I'd mess around with some Gamecube games due to the Wii's backwards compatibility.  Deceptively, with no issues, I played several Gamecube games on my Wii over the course of a few months.

Then I played F-Zero GX with 1019 on Wii.  From that point on, my 1019 was bricked and all my saves were lost.  Are certain games' save mechanisms not compatible with Wii/1019?  Is the Wii randomly introducing electric shock to corrupt the card?  The cause may not be known, but I have a $20 white brick.  It can't be formatted.

I'll consider buying another someday, but only to use in a real Gamecube."
214732,1,Out of the box they did not work.  I could hear other players but the mic was doa.  I should have learned from having these before.
293783,1,"The very first time I dropped the case (it fell from my coat pocket as I was picking up a package this morning) it popped open and sent my Vita skidding across the ground, scratching the hell out of it. Save your money and get a more compact case."
82581,1,The best part of this game is when you get to play the first room of metal gear solid 1 from the old playstation version. The rest is just hours of people talking in cutscenes about near-magical nanomachines.
37611,1,"they was this controller was discribed was not in the condition as stated. The color was very faded and scratched up, the pads on the joy stick had extreme wear and holes in it. Look like a garage safe reject. If this is the quality they sell then they have lost me as a customer."
117718,1,"I was really disappointed with this game.  The controls were lame and so was the story line.  Basically you run around killing aliens and destroying any ""trace"" of crashed space ships.  It was painfully easy as well.

One annoying thing in particular is that you had to use the R and L buttons to see where you were going, even when you were moving, instead of the character's perspective changing automatically as you moved.

I was expecting a good shooter or action game like God of War or The Warriors. This game is neither.

The bright side:  I got $10 bucks for it at a school flea market."
264997,1,I ordered and received a Saudi Arabia version instead of the USA one.  It did not state this in the description at all.
408282,1,bungie is not having new DLC on the last-gen consoles so don't buy if you have a ps3 or xbox 360
188823,1,"I'm a big fan of the Max Payne series and anxiously awaited this games release.  I was worried about the reviews saying the cut scenes were too long and frequent, and sure enough they were.  I put up with it, but I hated being forced to watch them over and over when I died and respawn (it get really old fast).  I made it as far a one challenge where I failed and faild and failed and I'm a major experienced gamer from way back who likes hard mode.  The game feels laggy often at the worst moments of battle and bottom line for me is after turning it off so frustrated I wanted to break the disk in two, and then coming back the next day after 'cooling off' I was back at that same frustration level again in no time.

I can put up with a lot of frustration in a game, but when I reach a point where no matter what I do I can't get past that challenge the game is over for me.  With no save point as in this game you're just forced to watch the same long cut scene over and over and put up with what appears to be an impass.  Games are supposed to be fun, and this one for me was a torture of frustration."
386820,1,it is pretty fun game but I don't like that this name is devil may cry and they completely changed the story line it bull that they did that to me I couldn't play it anymore once I new that killed the story
96652,1,this was the worst wirless device I have ever purchased. it was right next to the wireless router and still it woudl not poick it up. The sensor would not connect with the controllers. I ended up throwing it away and buying a plugged in one - a million times better
225533,1,I have size 10 and a half feet and i can not fit my feet anywhere on this board without the game freezing and telling me to stay off the edges!  So basically it is entirely unusable and was a complete waste of money. Cant express my dissatisfaction enough.
32299,1,"I'm seeing a disturbing trend in games featuring the Simpsons. First there was ""Simpson's Road Rage"" which was Crazy Taxi with Simpsons characters, which was half decent. But when they tried to apply the Simpsons to the Tony Hawk formula, they fell flat on their face, much like you will find youself doing quite often if you play this game. The controls so horrible that they render the game practically unplayable. The physics will not allow you to do what you'd like to do, making many of the goals completely unrealistic. The only thing this game has going for it are its graphics.
Bottom line: If you are going to buy this game, make sure you are willing to spend a lot of time learning the controls, because otherwise you will put it down after fifteen minutes and never have a desire to play it again. If you are a big fan of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series and big Simpson's fan, do not buy this game thinking you will get the best of both worlds because you will be very disappointed."
256742,1,I don't like it because no one can hear me beacause the mic is on my check and no where near my mouth. Is there anything you can do to help me? Right now I advise people not to buy this product. This is a disappointment. Please contact me ASAP.
426818,1,I cancelled my preorder when i discovered that this game is censored.
60922,1,"I wanted to like this game, the story line is decent and the graphics are good but navigating the screens is painful. They have taken what could have been a good game and ruined it by not paying attention to some basic navigation problems. The cursor indicates that you can move in a direction by showing shoe prints when you hold the cursor over a hot spot. But in this game the hot spots are tiny or in a lot of cases missing. This makes something that should be simple, moving around the screens, very frustrating. In one screen after 5 minutes of searching I couldn't find any hot spots that would allow me to move forward into the market area, even though it was evident that it was where I needed to go. So I gave up and started randomly clicking in the screen, which eventually allowed me to move forward, but again, no hot spots to indicate where I could move to from that position. So more random clicking to try to get to one of the booths in the market. After having to do this to move several times the screen finally changed to show the market from a different angle and at that point I had navigational hot spots again. The tiny hot spots also caused a problem with figuring out what items I was supposed to pick up or look at. It caused me to miss several items in certain screens. And in a few cases the hot spot was completely off the item altogether, causing some confusion as to which item I was to pick up or look at. Another annoying problem was that often my character would stand right in front of what I needed to look at or touch. So I had to keep clicking the screen around her to try to move her out of the way in order to get to the item in question. So unless you have an infinite amount of time and patience, try some other game."

There are some new things that are nice...but that list is so short, it is still not worth $40 or $50!!!

375846,1,"The right button gave out after less than 6 months of constant (but unagressive) use. I think the supports on the right button just broke because it's really hard to get the clicks to register. I'm dissappointed, as I really do have very few requirements for a mouse except to work without lag and to be durable, which this mouse clearly is not. I don't throw my mouse, I don't drop it, but I do use it a lot (everyday for a few hours) and the fact that it broke in only 6 months is really quite pathetic."

74687,1,"I knew that the pink controllers came out a long time ago but I had figured that buying one of these batteries to match my wife's controller would be perfect and they were a greal deal at only $5. However after charging it overnight on the ""official"" microsoft charger and placing it in the controller it only lasted one play session. The next day, tried to use it and nothing...no power or even a low batt light on the controller. These are probably left over old stock from back in 2006-7 when thery came out. Do not buy unless you just want a cheap batt to charge and play once per day. But really, why would you? I also purchased the Nyko ones and they are great!"
261430,1,"I bought this when it came out. But my PC would not install it. It said there was a corrupted .dll file on the disc. I tried multiple DVDs and they all said the same thing. All of the other LEGO games installed fine in the past, but this one would not.

Disney tech support did actually try to help, but with no avail. I blame Disney since it was the first one they were associated with.

I have just recently ordered it for Wii and I will play it at the laundry mat every other three weekends. So it will take awhile to finish it.

I'm sure the game is fun, just like the others, but it would not install and that is very frustrating."

223887,1,"I'm a real person, not a paid critic.  I rented this game and couldn't play it longer than ten minutes b4 my real life excited me more than wasting my time on this crap.  I was excited when I saw the commercial and thought it would be a great game. I couldn't believe when they made the game like Final Fantasy where I push triangle and then watch the characters try to do the button I chose for them. I write try b/c as you wrote half the time they wouldn't even do what you push.  I'll repeat myself.  I just can't play a game where off to the side of the screen it tells me to press triangle to attack or square to do magic, or circle to heal and then after I make my choice I have to wait three seconds to watch and see if my character will do it in a battle. I feel like these types of games should be banished from our century b/c they're too elementary."
162319,1,"Diablo 3, well I think it is obvious we all had high hopes. I was not completely disappointed with the game, it was ok. What I am disappointed with is the fact that my account was (just like all the others reporting) was hacked and everything stolen from my characters. In all the years I've been playing MMORPG's and online games I've never had my information stolen, yet with little effort it seems hackers can gain access to Blizzards database and take your info. Your login is also your email address. Blizzard then likes to offer you extra security for some money. I've never needed it with any other service and I certainly am not going to pay for it from Blizzard. Being hacked makes the game entirely unworthy of your time or the stress of having your information compromised."

Rent the game before you buy, even if you are a huge fan."

425211,1,"Why does this game garner so much high praise? The characters are awful and unlikable. The script is terrible. Your ""choices"" make no difference in the end, when you are given just 2 options, each of which were unaffected by the choice you made previously. I was actually unable to continue past the first chapter because I hated it so much. My girlfriend powered through just because she wanted to see how it ended. She was as unimpressed as I was. This game is total garbage."
10538,1,I throughly did not like this game at all. Unless you enjoy being on a set track and taking pictures of pokemon with a limited amount of film and giving them food or bombing them or playing music for them and taking more pictures. Then this game is not for you.

286079,1,"Turned my wonderful 5 year old nephew into a vidiot. Ok that's too strong, he's a bright kid, socialble kid, but he became too obsessed by this game and the figurines. He had about 10 or so of them and always wanted more. He gets locked in, and ignores anything but the game, goes in guns blazing, player dies, puts the next character on the portal, rinse and repeat. When all his characters are gone he bugs mom and dad and his uncle for new characters from the store $15 bucks a pop. His parents had to take away his video game privledges and he's now doing more constructive things like reading, puzzles, drawing, etc.

These games aren't constructive kids games, don't fool yourself, thats the point they are hard enough that you die quicker than normal, so you need more pieces to stay alive longer. Why do you think Disney went scrambling to make this game? Skylanders was monopolizing the market making money hand over fist.

The point of the developers making these games isn't to make a fun game for your child, it's about selling figurines.

Solution ? Stick with a fantastic Lego video game instead. Lego Star Wars, Lego Batman, Lego Harry Potter, Lego Pirates of the Carribean, etc.  If he/she is a little older the Mario games are fantastic as well."
433440,1,"This thing is way too old to cost more than $80. It's also pathetic on how Nintendo practice making sure you use this. They will have games they claim support the other controllers but you will certainly points in the game where it requires a gamepad. So God forbid you lost or broke yours, your console is useless now. Also games that are multi-player require several GAMEPADS. So you have to pay $1 each. The hardware in these things are trash, resolution is not even in 1080, touch screen technology is very old as well. Nintendo is stealing. Thank God their console is doing bad. I regret ever buying this console. All it does is sit collecting dust for a year until one good game comes out."
249093,1,"This game is probably the worst game I have ever played. Paper mario is my favorite n64 game and I love paper mario 2 but this game is a disgrace to the series. No lv ups when battling so there's no reason to battle enemies, no partners, no awesome music, if you don't have the right sticker you can't be certain bosses. Yeah skip this one is you value your time and money. I had high hopes for this game but they were slashed."
128562,1,"Worked great once, then I started getting lines on my tv while playing.  The next time I turned my wii on, the picture would flicker.

57806,1,"This game obviously isn't a finished product. It's full of glitches, and bugs. It is hardly worth more then ET for the Atari 2600.

It isn't worth it, even if you want a time wasting game. It's supposed to be a racing game, but it isn't. Your opponent doesn't even move. There is a fixer that you can download, but even then you always win. And when you do, you get greeted by a delightful "" YOU'RE WINNER ! "". You can easily move off track, and nobody would care. You can FLY THROUGH NOTHING. This game has no barriers, you can even pass through everything, including bridges. You can even run thousands of miles in a circle, and stop in a microsecond.

If you want to get the game for a laugh, buy it, but buy it somewhere else. It's overpriced on Amazon."
332626,1,"I hate my vita, it's geared towards Japanese gamers only. It's cumbersome, unresponsive controls, terrible selections of games, VERY expensive games.

406074,1,"Playing this is like watching dragon ball z, there is a lot of dialogue and it can take a bit of time to get through. The quests are often menial tasks that get to be time consuming and have little entertainment value. Almost four hours of cut scenes and dialogue with little fighting to wrap up the game. The difficulty on normal is well above what most games would consider normal. Normal battles are under challenging while boss fights can kill your party in seconds."
439445,1,Does not work correctly with xbox
138159,1,"Wow, I don't know where to start.  This game was just ported horribly from 360 to PC.  So much so that they should've just thrown it in the trash instead of release it.  I'll start off with the fact that they must've been on something good when they decided not to add 1680x1050 resolution support for this game.  I mean, what the heck is up with that?  I think the majority of gamers will have monitors with a resolution of 1680x1050, in other words, most 20""-22"" monitors, yet they didn't add support for it.  Hardcore gamers might have a 1920x1080, or 1980x1200 display, but what about those of us who thought 22"" was sufficient enough.  Okay, so I get over that issue by choosing the next resolution down that maintain's a 16:10 aspect ratio (1280x800), so the game looks OK at this resolution, but everyone knows that putting a LCD Monitor on anything other than it's native resolution really makes it quite blurry.

Ok, so I accept the blurriness but the game doesn't even feel like it's reaching 20FPS.  What's up with that.  I mean, my computer is pretty up to date with all recent technology.  I have not one, but two, GTX 280's in SLi, as well as the newest Phenom II processor released which is at a stock of 3.0GHz, however I have it overclocked to 3.6GHz, and I also have 8GB's of 800MHz DDR2 RAM.  You can imagine this system is quite awesome for Crysis, running usually a minimum of around 40-45PFS, even during intense scenes, and getting up to a max of around 80FPS.  So, why, does Saints Row 2, which is quite inferior in graphics, play at 20FPS and less?  Not sure myself but it sure does suck.  Sure, turning graphics down to low makes it run at a better FPS, but I didn't spend well over $1,500 on my PC to play a game on low settings.  I'm quite appalled by this, though I suppose I can't complain seeing as their competitor (Rockstar) didn't do too much better themselves on GTA IV.

Now, I regret not getting Saints Row 2 on 360 when it came out, because I was oh so sure the PC version would be amazing...boy was I wrong.  So anyway, those problems out of the way, there are still tons of other glitches and things that others have mentioned before.  One of the most prominent being items popping up out of no where.  Now, I understand it's a huge city, just like in GTA IV, but is it too much to ask for items to ""pop in"" maybe when I'm still five feet away instead of about one foot away.

All in all, the two games I were waiting for the most on PC (GTA IV, and Saints Row 2) both failed for me.  GTA IV is playable, but it seems much better on 360 than PC."

105472,1,no manual or code key. game useless.
169262,1,"First off, I am a big fan of the GTA series. Ever since GTA III, the sandbox nature of the game, the infinite urban sprawl and the rural backwoods have all been fun to explore, and the game has only gotten better over time. Well, almost.

  GTA IV, on its own, is a fun game, but lacks the depth and vastness of San Andreas, its predecessor. It improves graphically, but I feel certain elements were sacrificed in the process. Otherwise, great story, great gameplay, and excellent attention to detail.

  And if I were reviewing the PS3 version, it would have 5-stars. So, why only one star overall? Well, the first sign of problems came from SecuROM. Now, I hate game pirating as much as anyone, and I think there should be measures in place to prvent it. Invasive, questionably malicious software is not the answer. Second issue comes in the ""Social"" prompt, which plagues the game every time I want to start it up. That is a minor annoyance, but a detraction nonetheless. NOW, let's talk about the BIGGEST annoyance. If you want to autosave, you had better be willing to sign up to Windows Live. That's right, you are basically forced to bump Microsoft's Windows Live numbers if you want to use autosave. That would be like having to sign up for PSN if you wanted to save on that version, or signing up to the Nintendo Store if you wanted to save a game on Zelda. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE, MICROSOFT.

  The next problem is the graphics on the PC. I have a custom-made VAIO, the one where you pick the biggest laptop there, choose the blu-ray, most RAM, fastest processor, best graphics card. This laptop eats most games for lunch. Except, of course, GTA IV. Simply moving around in a small area is a chore, the dialogue is stilted, and driving is difficult. I've checked my settings, and the game is demanding maybe a quarter of my computer's resources... and it is STILL a mess. This isn't a performance issue. This is a sloppy programming issue.

Utterly unacceptable butchering of a good game."
229643,1,"I got this game with a $25 gift card to a game store so I figured I wouldn't be out too much if it was as hard as people say.  While I was finishing up another game I found the game guide to this game and thought awesome I'll be ready to attack.  I've spent several hours playing Dark Souls now and I ready to say it sucks.

Having a game guide/watching youtube/ internet cheating is probably the only way you'll make headway.  I read the reviews thinking I'll gut the game out with grit and determination but that's not the case.  For instance after the training level you're plunged into a world with several possible paths.  All but one of these paths will lead you to certain and repeated death.  There is no hint or cause as to how to traverse these areas so a guide is necessary.  Leveling up seems to have little effect as enemies will get you in a state of stun lock if you challenge 2 or more usually.  Keep in mind you can fall from about anywhere and that means you will be starting from a save point generally far away.  If you don't recover your body you've probably lost a great deaL of hard work.

One of my biggest gripes if that you have no clue when sudden death is coming.  Thought you found a secret area.  You'd better hope that enemy you are about to attack doesn't have 3000x your hit points or its bye bye to the last 30 minutes work.

The game isn't challenging or fun. Its basically a trial in what you will put up with.  The camera is whack. The knowledge given to you within the game is lacking and the graphics aren't nearly as good as people say.

If you love pointless dying this is your game, get on the internet, cheat away, then act like you did it on your own."
271104,1,"EA, we are disappointed with your cynically manipulative approach to customers. SimCity was badly broken and you have told us repeatedly that you have no plans to fix it - that large cities, for instance, are impossible. Not only have your statements been misleading on a technical level but they also underscore the essential laziness that defines your approach to gaming. Cash farming is what EA does best, and SimCity perpetuates the long-standing tradition.

You're paying EA to rent (not own) a copy of a badly broken game. You're paying to be constantly checked in upon to make sure you're not pirating or cheating or (worst of all) playing offline.

You can encourage this manipulation or you can go play something else. Your choice."
148633,1,"And now Atari joins the DRM thralls with a protection scheme so stringent that legitimate buyers won't be able to install the game!

Whether the title is fun on non-PC platforms or not, I don't know (and for those who managed to install, they have realized in shock that multiplayer options have been taken away for PC users). I can't get my copy to install regardless of what I try. If you search the Atari forums, you will find lots of similar complaints and very little in the way of answers. And it doesn't just fail to install for Windows 7 users -- it has failed to do so for customers owning XP and Vista as well."

The game itself would be a lot of fun, but this particular issue isn't updated enough to play on my machine, and is a dangerous trouble maker."

178117,1,"I was disappointed when I played this game on the X360.  I was hoping for an action-decision-based RPG game from Bioware - along the lines of Mass Effect.

Unfortunately, Dragon Age is a LOT more time-consuming and less fun.  It all comes down to what type of gamer you are, I suppose.  DA is VERY backstory-oriented and expects you to WANT to spend 60% of your total game-playing time speaking with others, scrolling through obvious conversation choices, listening to banter or watching cutscenes.

Unfortunately, that was not what I was looking for, so I did not enjoy this game.  I will stick with KOTOR and Mass Effect."

209321,1,"I'm never paying full price for an Ubisoft game again.  I've been playing Xbox games for over eight years, and GRFS is the buggiest game I've ever had.

Ubisoft apparently has no problem punishing their best customers so that they can squash the spectre of used game buyers and software pirates.  On the PC side, their games are saddles with an overly-intrusive DRM that makes it difficult for honest customers to play even the single-player campaign.  On the Xbox, where we already pay for Xbox Live, you need to have a Uplay ""online pass"" in order to play multiple.  The problem is that this technology, like all DRM, is broken.  In addition, since the online pass normally costs $10, then your game immediately loses $10 trade-in value if you play the multiplayer even once.

For the past week, my friend and I have tried to continue our co-op campaign, but it doesn't work any more.  Most of the time, the game refuses to connect -- either some nonsense about missing DLC (neither of us have purchased any DLC) or an inability to find the ""host"".  When it does connect, my Xbox hangs as soon as we try to start the mission.

If you go to the Ubisoft forums, you'll find hundreds of people complaining about hangs and crashes.  This game is just plain broken, and there is no indication that Ubisoft is actually trying to fix anything.  This game has been out for three months, so it's completely unacceptable that it's still this broken."
176059,1,"Ordered this from Amazon over a month ago.  They had a very long delivery schedule, but OK.  I'm willing to wait.  I had 3 copies on order for myself, a friend, and my wife.  We waited while our other friends simply bought theirs from other distributors or in brick and mortars.  Today (around the time it was supposed to have arrived) I get notified that the order has been canceled due to a ""lack of availability from our suppliers.""  Funny, it seems to be in stock, just at a MUCH higher price than it was when I ordered it over a month ago.  Amazon if you have a pricing error, just TELL ME UP FRONT so I'm not sitting around like an idiot waiting for you to never come through.

442996,1,"Now, because this is a negative review, most won't find it ""helpful."" Thats OK. For those of you who are seeking to get info about the XBOX Ones console, be forewarned. I just wish someone had shared an HONEST REVIEW containing HALF of the things that I have been through and spared me the TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT and UTTER REGRET that I am now experiencing with this console. Here is a bulleted list of the XBOX One S console's greatest failures:
 You must wait hours to play a new game  each new game MUST first be installed even if you have the disc. And if you have the disc, it must always be inserted into the console for you to play it even though youve downloaded it onto the console.
 You must put in all information before you play for the first time, including your credit/debit card info.
 Like a PC, the console automatically uses a percentage of your space before any game is downloaded. For example, my 2TBs were actually 1.6 TBs available for my use. For the 500 GB consoles, you have just 362 GBs of space available for you to use.
 Games must be updated often. For example, with Call of Duty  Infinite Warfare (COD), updates occur about every three weeks. Some updates take hours.
 You must pay $60 a year to interact online or $10/month or $25/three months.
 Just two months in, the console stopped working because it needed to be directly plugged into an outlet, not a surge protector power strip.
 There are constant advertisements when you first start the console up and during game play.
 You CANNOT PLAY ALL RETRO GAMES on this console. There is no backwards compatibility for the first XBOX consoles games. Whereas Nintendo allows you to play its very first games on its consoles, not so with many games from XBOXs earliest console and beyond.
 If you want extra content for a particular game you must purchase a season pass. This season pass is $40 per game and per profile. So, with COD, if I want to get extra content, I have to pay $40 and that season pass may only be used on MY profile, not my sons. If I want his profile to be able to access the season pass I must pay an ADDITIONAL $40.
 You may only return games just ONCE in a 12-month period of longer, and even this is said to be a courtesy. So be sure about what you purchase BEFORE you buy  Xbox allows you to preview some games, I suggest you play the game before buying it.
 Xbox has the worst customer service of any console that I have ever owned  and I have owned several different consoles. They keep me on hold for half an hour or so on MOST occasions. They must send verification codes to service you and sometimes the codes NEVER arrive. They tell you one thing and you find that they are lying but they never admit that they're lying, of course.
 Poor parental controls are staples of XBOX. Once I tried to check to see if my son had purchased something on his profile and was told that I had no right to his gaming info unless I had his email account name and password.

7/12/17 Wanted to add that after you change your ""gamertag"" once, it costs $10 to do so again. Just a PATHETIC console. BY FAR the WORSE console I could ever IMAGINE being produced. Just awful.

The goal of this review is to help people to understand just what they are getting when they make this purchase. I was patient with this console, and so by the time I faced the FACT that XBOX is NOT the console for my family, Id had this console for well over three months and so all I can do is trade it in. However, trade-in costs are very low: I paid almost $450 for my XBOX One S and can only trade it in for less than HALF that amount - $179. The 30 or 40 games that I paid $80 each for are now worth all of $5 and $10. The LONE good thing about the console is the graphics. But the bad outweighs even that BY FAR. I say skip XBOX One in any form (S or X)  get a Nintendo Switch instead!"
89649,1,"1. EA still refuses to enable Widescreen support for its non-sport, non-console titles despite Widescreen monitors becoming more and more mainstream.  Nasty hacks/workarounds are necessary - for BF2 I spent nearly 4 hours just making the game look right and quit resetting resolution on my Widescreen. Even then - it is not as good looking as real widescreen support.

2. EA charges $50 and then as part of the EULA (End User License Agreement) requires that you consent to the display of in-game ads, and installation of spyware/malware which collects your surf habits in order to play online.  I would rather not have a bright neon display selling Coca Cola in a post-apocalyptic future.  Does not fit the setting.  Just an attempt by a greedy publisher to gain money at the expense of, not by helping its customers in enjoying the product.

3. EA leaves bugs that have existed since BF2 in-game, and on release this game has been buggy and patches are few and far between.  If its support of BF2 is any indication - gamers will be disappointed in that patches generally break/unbalance things rather than fixing reported problems.

On a positive note (to earn its one-star) is that the new Titan mode is pretty harrowing and exciting... assuming you are actually able to find a stable server and your system doesn't crash your client randomly.

I for one am boycotting EA titles until customer grievances are redressed appropriately.  Withour your customers - no advertising company will see a point in paying to have their ads in-game."

374247,1,"the lag is horribe on xbone live

136991,1,"The Star rating above for ""fun"" above should read ZERO stars. Sorry. My bad.

I never write reviews for products I have never even tried--unless something that is relevant to other potential buyers prevents me from trying or owning it, in which case a review is necessary to inform potential buyers. That is the case with Red Alert 3, where the Draconian copy protection issue has indeed prevented me from purchasing a game that I had looked forward to owning with nothing but joyful anticipation for a long, long time--until the day it was released, and EA Games insulted my dignity.

In a world where so many people are quick to give up their dignity in favor of ""security"", ""comfort"", and in this case, the ability to play a video game, I have no choice but to boycott Red Alert 3 and all other EA Games products.

The executives at EA games have never met me. Why then do they assume that I go to work each day to earn money, spend a large sum of that money on one of their video games, and then GIVE what I just paid for away to thousands of people whom I've never even met on the internet? For that matter, why do they assume that I would ever know HOW to do something like this, if I wanted to? This is an insult to my dignity, and an overestimation of my technical skills, for no good reason.

Furthermore, calling those lawbreakers who DO copy software ""pirates"" is a profound insult to every victim of real PIRATES throughout history--people who have been disfigured, raped, murdered, and sold into slavery. I'm sorry, but calling a paying customer a potential ""pirate"" is far more of an injury to me, than enduring the ""suffering"" of never owning a game that I otherwise would have gladly purchased at full price.

Let your own conscience be your own guide. But make no mistake about it--the DRM issue with Red Alert 3 IS relevant, and it IS grounds for boycotting all EA Games products. Not only has EA Games totally ruined this gaming experience for me, but they have even corrupted my memory of fun and comradery that I enjoyed playing previous versions of Command & Conquer with my friends over the years. EA Game executives have taken so very much away from us. Why then would anyone who possesses even a shred of self-worth even consider purchasing another one of their products?

I give this product 0 stars, because the manufacturer has created conditions that provide zero pleasure from this product."
147793,1,"Most XBOX users are used to controls that were developed with halo and have now pretty much carried over to most games on the market.  Move with left stick, look with the right.  Well, this game is a blast to the (frustrating) past.  You move around with one stick, then have to hold a button in order to switch to aim mode (which takes a whole second), and you use the same stick now to aim, while you stand still and get beat up by zombies.  It takes a few seconds just to shoot a guy standing 6 inches in front of you.  Don't even get me started with the horrible AI your partner has...

I think fans of the franchise will love this game, controls are similar to the (4 year old) resident evil 4 game.  For someone new to the series, I urge you to try the demo before forking a lot of money at this game.  If you can get used to the controls, it's a decent game (not great), and pretty short, but getting used to those controls can be torture."
342562,1,"It's a very nice mouse, especially for the money. It has a button that changes the DPI scaling, I personally don't find the light to be too bright, and the wiring sheath is nice woven material. My only complaint (and why I took a star), my cable arrived and it looked like a rodent got a hold of the cable sheathing, so I have random thread pulls all over the place. It doesn't affect the mouse at all it seems, so I assume the internal cabling is fine. The packaging was also very nice. All in all, I would recommend this to someone I know.

UPDATE: 6 Months Later
The mouse still works for most part, but the left mouse button has a tendency to double click on it's own. This mouse was on my laptop and underwent light use (mostly turn based games, web browsing, and photoshop). It's a really nice mouse when it's new, but it doesn't seem to hold up well."

387060,1,These replacement batteries for Xbox One controllers are cheap and perform poorly.  They lose their charge quickly and take too long to reach a full charge.  They are not worth buying.  The only positive is the nice blue LED as opposed to the orange/white LEDs of the original batteries.  Even the micro USB cables that come with them are flimsy and have a poorly constructed insulating jacket.
276208,1,"You know, I've played a lot of MMOs...but this one has frustrated me the most...it's beautiful, and the game is a great RPG to level 50 but the endgame is GARBAGE...be prepared for endless grind in a few horrible dungeons, extremely poor planning and bad difficulty curves on ""Titan"" and other bosses, 2 hour queues and general boredom while you wait. There are so many other good games out there... I guarantee you are going to end up as irritated as I am if you expect this to be more of a standard RPG with about 20 hours of actual gameplay. As an RPG, this deserves a higher rating but as an MMO it FAILS. Bad work, Squeenix...stick to single player games."

400699,1,"What's better than a driving game that makes you constantly close text boxes plastered all over the screen so you don't crash? Yeah. That's what you can expect  with this trash game. Come on EA. You're killing it, I mean, killing your franchise!

Anyway...I can't believe what EA has done to destroy this beloved franchise. First off, know that Criterion (Burnout and Hot Pursuit devs) They did not make this game. This atrocity was made by an entity called Ghost. In a nutshell, this game is complete garbage. Oh Criterion, you are missed already... You're better of sticking in a 10 year old NFS game then play this. Read on.

I could barely get through this hour of play time.  First issue,  almost everything in this game is recycled from NFS Rivals and I wasn't a big fan of that one either but hey if the gameplay is great? Give it a chance right? But no, like others have mentioned, this is nothing but a copy and paste of Rivals.  Yea EA being EA! The B actors they hired are absolutely detestable and you're forced to listen to their tripe and these cut scenes are so bad I want cringe. You will get sick. Grab the barf bags. There's more videos of atrocious cut scenes than you are actually driving the car. Can we leave videos to youtube and not for video games? Even worse, you can't skip it. The fast and furious rendition attempts to  come into play and you'll laugh listening to these idiots, but the worst part, (nope, you can't skip it).

Anyway, when you finally get to drive, you are engulfed with obtrusive text boxes that cover the screen, while you're driving I might add and you have to constantly press B to get rid of it before you crash. After about 15 closures of text books I didn't want to read and constantly being interrupted, the driving finally comes into play. At first glance, I have to say, it's probably the prettiest night time driving I've ever seen.  The cars are purty, very well detailed, and nice cosmetical damage. But...

The good stops there.  The driving itself is borderline bad. The drifting? Um, I'll say this, ""what drifting?"" There is no drifting that I could see or pull out, I felt completely out of control of my ride.  I've felt better handling on Rad Racer for the NES.  And of course, no surprise. No Dash view hurts too, I love seeing the old dashboard in the old NFS games, none of that here. The game is apparently online online ONLY and I of course was having server issues geting into a game too.  Network lag was HORRIBLE and I kept glitching out back to the beginning of a race. I got booted out of a mission right in the middle of the game, and I just had to wait to go back.  Okay, I'm done. Thanks for the beta demo and calling it a complete game.

Just a note. I only played the XBOX One trial but I was originally planning on getting it for ps4, but I assume the ps4 version will be nearly identical."
271215,1,"Well I got the game on launch day and was only able to play for an hour.  3 days Later I was able to play a few hours.  A week later I can play when I want to play.  The server crisis has cleared with more servers.  The problem now is after you hit a population over 40k you will begin seeing some bugs that people playing the beta would never have found as they could only play for an hour at a time before it would make you restart.

So conclusion:  I would wait and see if all of the bugs are fixed. With how things are being patched daily for the server bugs it could be awhile.  I would give it 3 months and it should be up to par for what the game should have been on launch day. Don't get me wrong the game itself has a lot of potential but cant legitimize the buy with all the bugs.  Wait to buy for now, come back later."

364637,1,"Now that the hype is gone, I'm updating this review. I honestly kind of liked the story, but there are major problems with the gameplay. Remember when you could go into a burgershot, clukin bell or diner? Yeah, that's completely gone now in GTA 5. Remember when you could go to a comedy club? Also gone in this game. There are almost no interactible inside places in this game besides missions. The graphics are fantastic on all platforms, but that does not make it a good game. What I really hated about GTA 5 the most was the missions. You do the same stupid, pointless heists that some are nearly impossible to do, you chase and kill and other things that are just ridiculous for a Grand theft auto game. There was one mission where you have to jump in an airplane and hijack it. I sometimes felt like I was playing a game that was based off a 007 movie rather than GTA. This entire game just felt rushed and horribly streamlined. Should've known something was very wrong when the game was delayed 3 times. GTA 4 was simple and more interactive than this. Almost forgot to mention all of the bugs and glitches that make this game even worse."
290422,1,"One star, because there's no story, no good game play, lack of things to do, the grind is on an insane level. Bungie has no idea on how to make a MMO. Plus 500 million dollar budget on this poor quality game. Its not even fun when you're playing with other people. The only good thing about the game is the music and visuals.

 I did not find this fun because I had experience playing other MMOs. I think a lot of people enjoy this game because its their first MMO, and they don't have anything to compare Destiny to other relate able MMO games. That's completely understandable and hey if you have fun then that's cool.

I recommend this game to people who never played a MMO, who don't care about story, or a serious bungie fan. But if you're like me that craves a good story in games and have experience playing MMOs then this game is not for you."
245031,1,"WARNING: There is NO online multiplayer for this game!

Essentially what you are buying is an updated version of the original game with better graphics - nothing more. The online multiplayer utilizes the ""Halo: Reach"" engine, but includes maps from ""Halo: CE"".

Their excuses for this:

1) ""We didn't want to split up the reach community!""
Bizarre logic. Should we expect that for H4? Sorry guys, no H4 multiplayer - wouldn't want to split up the Reach community! Just imagine if COD used that logic. You buy Modern Warfare 3, only to find out that online multiplayer is Black Ops. What brilliance! Point being, everyone wanted online multiplayer for CE. Even the people that criticize us for being pissed off admit they would of liked to have seen multiplayer for CE.

2) ""We would have had to ship on 2 discs!""
Would you buy a 2 disc game for the ability to play online multiplayer? There's your answer to this excuse.

Answers to people criticizing my review:

1) ""You should have read the box!""
A) It's not a box, it's a case.
B) This is Amazon.com - not Wal-Mart. There is no ""box"" to look at. Nowhere in this page's product description does it say it utilizes the Halo: Reach engine.
C) I didn't buy the game, knowing months before that it didn't include online multiplayer. I created a petition on Change as well as the Waypoint forums to bring multiplayer back. I don't know why you genius's assume because I'm complaining about there not being multiplayer, that apparently means I thought there was. I want multiplayer on the game whether or not I thought it was going to have it or not - duh!
D) Go heckle people walking out of Target and Wal-Mart. Go chill inside of Gamestop and right after someone buys the game you can start yelling ""SHOULDA READ THE BOX, DERRR"". Who does that anyways? Is it common for games that have the xbox live strip, to be a different xbox live game? Besides ODST, this is the only game I know of that utilizes a completely different game's online portion. Do you really expect people to go on a treasure hunt on the back of the box to question what should already be assumed?

2) ""They released this game and you can't be grateful for what you get?""
I'm sorry, I didn't know I was getting this for free. I didn't realize they donated their hundreds of millions of dollars to charity. Wow, you have totally opened my mind, and my heart."
434707,1,"Controller looks official on the page but is incredibly cheap and flimsy. Came out the envelope with faulty D-pad, and the ""analog sticks"" are actually digital octo-gate inputs, meaning they have no variable sensitivity and rather than go 360 degrees they have eight directions they register, period.

Complete waste of money, waste of time, cannot possibly recommend less."

438592,1,"As someone who will be a former Madden 15 owner, I must say there's no real difference between 15 and 17. Sure, you have the usual updated rosters and a slightly modified control system for the running game, but paying $60 for a game that doesn't bring anything new or different to the table? Deplorable.

I've been an EA Sports fan for years, but noticed they were becoming too laid back with the Madden games beginning about six or seven years ago. It used to be EA always offered something new or different with each Madden iteration--along with fixes in the controls--but that's no longer the case. I knew I was in trouble when I looked at the back of the game and noticed that nothing new was highlighted with the game description. I found it funny that their main feature was ""New Dynamic Commentary""! As someone who owned Madden 15, I will say it is new. Listening to Phil Simms got tiring really quickly and anyone else was a welcomed addition. But dynamic? Hardly.

It's incredible that EA has produced exceptional NHL games year after year for close to a decade now. Many of those games are hailed as some of the best sports games ever produced--and that's saying something considering 2K Sports makes great NBA and MLB games. Yet, EA has gotten tremendously lazy with the Madden title. I don't necessarily expect MAJOR changes going from, say, Madden 15 to 16, but I do expect sizable changes between 15 and 17.

But I have to give the game a modicum of credit: The controls are responsive and intuitive. Again, however, that is a carry-over from 15.

In conclusion, it's time someone else produce NFL games. EA has become too lazy with this property and are charging TOO much for the same game, that's nearly the exact same game as two years earlier, and on a previous generation system. Perhaps give 2K Sports the license for a while? Hell, they work their asses off to make each iteration of their sports titles unique from the previous. I would ONLY recommend buying this game if your latest Madden game is, at least, three years old. Even then, you're still paying too much for the game. Buy it used."
437848,1,"I've been fair and gave this game a chance. I thought people were being too harsh on IW. I like the nice graphics, beautiful scenes and characters. This game is like mixing call of duty, star wars battlefront and black ops 3 together. These 3 certainly doesn't mix. The weapons and game play sucks in this game. I never thought call of duty couldn't get any worst than black ops 3. Fighting in space and shooting walking machines with energy laser type weapons is similar to the ones star wars is certainly something that is not desired. There is a reason why the sales are down for this one and for the many bad reviews. I was going to spend the 79 for the legacy to get the remaster but its not worth it unless you like IW too. I think COD should have taken a battlefield 1 approach. I'm glad i rented this instead of spending the whole amount. This game will have a low resell value."
71674,1,"This looked like a regular charger with molded plugs, but when the plug on the game side got stuck in his GameBoy, my son pulled hard, and the whole plug just slipped right off the wire. It's not actually molded, and it's not attached well (I used to do a lot of electronics work; I worked my way through school as an industrial mechanic/electrician). It's a cool design, but this little thing is poop. It died on the second use.

The better and more useful one that I found is the charger listed as 'Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance SP Rapid Home Travel Charger with IC Chip'. The design on the one we received was far superior. The blades on the transformer (the part that goes in the wall power outlet) swivel, so it doesn't block another AC jack. It was much higher quality, and we've had no problems with it. It's only about a dollar more."
346414,1,"Don't waste your time or money. No good games for Kinect, and not many games anyway. I didn't think the Kinect could get worse, from the 360 Kinect, but it sure did. Sadly wiiu is SO much better. Why did Microsoft make it, so you could not use the Kinect from the 360? but then not make any good games, to go with the new Kinect? Motion on either Kinect is horrible. It won't keep up or sync correctly. I have 1 Kinect game, and its on the 360 that isn't bad. Which ever Kinect sports has the golf, is the one I liked. Every other game for Kinect is junk. Please don't waste your time or your hard earned money on this plastic POS! Microsoft should be very ashamed. I am for them."
418568,1,I am a long time fan of this series and I haven't even played RB4 yet-  I hate it for one very simple reason:  when responding to a user's outstanding and detailed review of their product Harmonix responded with pure bulls***.  That tells me everything I need to know and saves me $80.
199311,1,"It came with a broken piece: the lens' engine. It wouldn't play any games, all I could do was navigate the System's main menu. I had to spend over 50 dollars trying to repair. And when I finally got it to play games, it kept, and keeps, making strong noises while reading game discs."
347836,1,"The Playstation 4 was designed to cool itself. Adding a fan unit like this product it only wasting energy and creating more noise. If you are having problems with your PS4 overheating, you should return it. If used in properly ventilated areas, it should never overheat. Do you strap on extra fans to any other device you own? Why do video game consoles need one?"

112969,1,"I Sold mine to a friend for $35.00! It's terrible!
This is a fine example of the greed EA and the gaming industry is headed to.
This game could have been game of the year but instead it was released too early with few maps and many unsolved problems, including uncontrollable snipping, terrible hit detection system, few and small maps and many other issues.
Being a BBC2 fan I was hoping for an improvement with this game and in fact it takes a few steps back in game developing and to my amazement they release a DLC pack only a couple weeks after the unfinished game was released!? WOW! Maybe they should have left that pack in the game and spent some more time smoothing out all the issues it has. It's rough!
You will get very frustrated at the constant sniping and your life span will be only a few seconds all the time. In fact you will spend more time actually waiting for the game to start then in actual combat. Worst letdown ever in a game for me!
I purchased an Xbox 360 slim and a PS3 slim this year with the hope of some great gaming. What I got was low quality games full of errors, rough and obviously rushed to release to increase revenue (Fable 3, Medal of Honor, Fallout NV) I have no problem with them making money, but I demand quality in the product! My only hope now is that COD Black Ops will be more like COD4 then MW2 or I may be done with the video game industry for good!

**********
Don't buy DLC (DownLoadable Content) from companies that release low quality games or games with errors and glitches until the fix them! If you support them buy buying DLC they will continue to release lower and lower quality games and try to sell more and more DLC! Greed has taken over the gaming industry, it's up to us to say no! Next they will try to charge us to play online on top of what you pay Microsoft! All the professional reviewers are being payed! You've been warned!"

*Online is a mess and its hard to invite friends
*Menus have extreme load times and are not very easy to use
*800 cars are only available through used car dealers and they change every 2 days

There are too many to list here.  I have had this game pre ordered for a couple years.  What a huge let down."
54471,1,"Before I start this review I want to say a few things. I am a LONG time gamer, I have lots of love for all genres especially JRPGs and I am fairly lenient on games. I try to find enjoyment in games that are simply un-enjoyable or have many issues. However I am sorry to say that Fable: The Lost Chapter brings a new definition to the term ""Garbage."" It is simply the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. Now I will tell you why:

Story - It blows. It is very disjointed and is hardly enjoyable. It is your very basic story about your family being killed and rising to become a hero to beat the evil. Nothing more, and nothing less. I'm fine with that, but the way the story presents itself is dreadful.

Voice Acting - Atrocious Crap. A 5 year old child could bring more emotion to characters than the people who did this. It is unbelievable in every sense of the word. The characters seems lifeless and the voice actors are annoying.

Music - Nothing memorable at all. I know you don't have Nobuo Uem, or Tsuyoshi Sekito but damn not one good track at all?

Gameplay - It's bad. You will essentially be button mashing the entire game with the exception of occasionally healing yourself or casting a lame animation spell. The good/bad system in the game is flawed beyond belief. I know that if you commit bad deeds you should be punished but this game FORCES you to be a good guy or else you will have to pay massive amounts of money which is simply impossible. The entire system is unnecessary if you can't choose.

Technical Issues - Loads of them. There is pop-in, screen tearing, freezing, and many other various glitches in the game. My favorite game of the current generation is bug ridden as well (The Last Remnant) but at least it had good VA, Story, Gameplay, and AMAZING music.

I know this is coming off as a HUGE rant and I don't mean to offend any of the Fable fans. However I was just extremely disappointed with this game after hearing just glowing impressions from them. I am just ashamed that I spent 12 dollars on this and I bought the 2nd one as well which I am just horrified to open.

I'm sorry Peter M, but if your other games are as bad as this one I will have to agree with your comment about you never making a good game. If you like WRPGs I would recommend that you borrow this from a friend or rent it first so you don't take a leap of faith like I did.

Rating 1/5 Abysmal"
172612,1,"I haven't been able to actually use the wheel since I don't have any compatible games.  That's where the problem lies.  I heard that the wheel worked with Indy 500 and the Ferrari game.  It does not work with either.  I spent a LOT of time searching for a list of games that work and if that list exists I sure can't find it.  The best list I've found on the net so far is one of the reviews on this page.  There are only about 4 games that work with this and the only one I would be interested in is F1 but that lists for  $104 at the time I wrote this.  Logitech forums have no info on what games work or any useful info for that matter.  Unless you have (or plan to buy) any of the games listed elsewhere in these reviews, I would stay away from this even at this super reduced price.

  If you are buying one of the very few compatible games, this seems to be a very well built item.  It's comfortable on the lap and has a nice force feedback.

  In summary: If you are ok with the fact that this wheel only works with a few games it is a very good buy.  If you aren't buying one of the very few compatible games than I would stay away from this.  The fact that they are not carried on the logitch site basically means that the few games that work with it will be the ONLY games to ever work with it."
396367,1,"this is the same junk EA put out last year. don't be mislead  by 4 star and 5 star reviews. I just finish playing a game. i'll probably be taking this game back to the game store for a refund and put the refund toward Call of duty B3. I wanted to like this game but I could not get pass how it looks and plays like M15 but with a weaker defense  if I was you I would not buy it. just keep playing M14, M15, or go back to M13"
304998,1,"I also have to say my experience with this game has been entirely negative. The problem is not that there are not enough servers, it's that there is no reason for a single player game to require servers at all. You cannot save your games on your own computer. If they put out a new version and close this down, all of your games will be gone. I will continue to rate this at 1 star until they come out with an update to no longer require play on EA's servers. Shame on EA for this crappy game."
155328,1,"I bought this cable to use with my Playstation 2 and my BRAND NEW TV. To make a long story short, I hooked up the Playstation to the Tv using this cable and it doesn't work. Defective product or The technology is behind the Tv's capabilities. at least I only spent $3 on this crap cable."
448855,1,"Every time I try to play this game,I keep crashing into cars and other obstacles. Falling off of your bike is a pain in the neck and running to get back on it,takes forever. The control is terrible and the gameplay is very choppy. There aren't that many locations to race at,and the combat is dull and boring. I wouldn't recommend this game at all. I would recommend buying ""Skitchin"" instead. It's alot more easier and fun,compared to ""Road Rash""."
33529,1,"The game itself is great, graphics, sounds, and concept is just like the TV show.  The major issue I have with it is the fact that it constanly locks up.  I'm running a PIII 733, 512mb Ram, 32 mb Video Card, 16 mb Sound card, and don't have such problems with other games which require a higher minimum system requirement.  Due to these technical issues I've encountered with the game, I have not been able to complete it.  It becomes extremely fustrating, especially if you've got something and getting hotter and closer to cracking the case.  If it wasn't for all this lock up, the game would be great.  The game is worth 1 star, even if there was an option for no stars, it still is worth 1 the 1 star I gave it."
439239,1,"Really bad multiplayer. most everyone is sniping and camping. The middle of the map is like a wasteland because if you rush you will lose. Its basically 10 campers behind rocks shooting another 10 campers behind other rocks. You die from the weirdest angles because of squad spawn. Im not the greatest FPS player, but there are many other FPS games that I wasn't that great at that I loved. The guns are super weak except the sniper of course which creates campers galore. I'm not a cod fanboy either, i'm not the biggest fan of the latest COD's either. This game is overrated and overrun by elitists who love the game, basically both COD and BF, like republicans and democrats, leave much to desire."
137762,1,"We now have a choice to make as a gaming community. If you want to play and support game makers and let them manage your computer for you. Or not play games.

As easy as it is to get a clean copy of this and crysis add ons, I can not justify stealing, as I can not justify letting game makers control MY computer."
409225,1,I'm convinced that the creators of this game are either scammers or developmentally disabled.  They even get basic things like instant replay camera angles shockingly wrong.  The game mechanics are a joke and always have been.  The entire sports video game industry is a scam built on glitches and stupidity.
400844,1,I love everything about this amiibo. Ganondorf is amazing! But I bought it from France because I refuse to pay a scalper!
159377,1,Not worth the money for this game. The Sims 3 is more like the Sims 1. It is slow and boring. I don't like the idea that there are some parts of the sims that will need to be patched. When Agnes Crumplebotton finally gets the chance to bring her husband back from the dead. He doesn't even get to live with her and in the game he is always leaving. I don't like the idea that you can't switch from family to family just like the sims 2. I am probably done with the sims 3 and probably won't be buying any expansion packs.
439422,1,"Once again, the same issues continue to plague BF series games.
1. Too many cheaters ruin the game.
2. No skill balancing. New players become food for older more experience.
3. Single player game is the only part worth playing."
229489,1,"I'm a single player mode only gamer. I bought this game through Amazon based on trailers I'd seen and a couple of game mag reviews. BUT unlike every other RETAIL purchased game I have that requires a Steam registration to play (as stated on the DVD wrapper), the Homefront publisher goes far beyond this - and no advisement or other statement - where the game installs directly to Steam's game file storage - NOT ON YOUR HD. The only files installed on your computer are the game's Steam related access and security/permissions files. If you use a magnifying glass you'll find buried in the fine print and half obliterated by the DVD wrapper graphics in the lower right corner the statement you are purchasing a subscription to play the game. As such you can't access the .cfg files to halt the intro graphics or other common game .cfg file changes. Point being if you lose your Internet connection you will not be able to play in single player mode even if you have previously selected ""Offline"" mode with Steam because Steam checks to make sure you still want to play offline.

As if this wasn't bad enough, while the game installation was a relatively short under 20 minutes at my 2.6 MBps download speed, when it completed it then automatically began downloading the patch files - 99% for multiplayer - which I didn't want or need. I was never presented an option not to download the updates. So there I sat for an additional nearly 40 minutes for the update download - over twice as long as the game install took.

Once I got to the game itself, I found discrepencies with the stated console ported PC controls - such as the #4 key that is used to target enemy vehicles or other targets for attack - is not listed in the game manual. I eventually found the #4 key by mashing every key in succession. Once I got to where you fly the attack helicopter the stated ascend and descend manual default listed keys didn't work nor when I remapped the keys. Through dumb luck I found out the game was detecting my CH USB joystick elevator control. As such I had to unplug my joystick to gain keyboard key ascend and descent funtion.

Last, the game uses auto save points and even on the lowest difficulty setting all but the those with the fastest twitch reflexes will be repeating the same sequences time and again because of getting taken out by grenades that some how find you taking cover behind a shed or building with no enemy in sight. Bottom line, forget about using stategy or planning your moves or you'll die regularly. The best thing I found is to keep moving and hiding and moving and hiding and moving and hiding to get as close to the next checkpoint position .... and this isn't a sure thing either.

Bottom line, if you're a single mode player and don't mind having a retail purchased game really being a paid subscription to access the installed game files on Steams website, limited installs, screwed up and non-identified console to PC keyboard game controls, auto-save points and a high game play frustration tolerance, then Homefront is for you."
275589,1,"Gun is child size, too small for an average adult to hold like a real rifle without it being really awkward. Because of the size you probably won't shoot it like a rifle, you'll hold it out from your body like a pistol. So it would have been a lot smarter and more realistic to just make the gun a pistol. Sights are useless, only two white plastic bumps. When holding the gun like a rifle I found it to small to use the sights anyway. Gun requires two AA batteries and sensor bar requires two AA batteries. Can't say much else about it because my gun would not connect to the console. The gun has an on/off button on the side just like on a Xbox 360 controller. When I pressed the button on the gun the lights would spin like it was trying to connect with the console but never would. My regular controller had no problems connecting. I guess you could play this game with the regular controller, but the whole reason I bought it was to play it with the gun. Since the gun doesn't work and was a joke anyway, I didn't bother playing it with the controller and decided to return it."
371574,1,"Not that Bethesda designers will ever read this, but maybe players will be warned. On the easiest setting, had a great time, but at the Foundry I had the worst experience I have ever had in gaming. Round and round and round you go getting nowhere fast. Did the designers get a laugh when they made this ridiculous, contrived level? Check the forums. Gamers bitterly complain about this confusing, stupid play. I rarely give up on a game, but the Foundry did it for me. Seeing the YouTube walkthroughs was no help as the level does not lend itself to visual explanation. Same for the text explanations. Drop down and turn left, cross over the catwalk, etc. Drop down from where? Turn left? Are you kidding. The dark corridors all look the same and catwalks are everywhere. I have beaten many games on the most difficult levels, but this is not a game, it's a bad joke. Dear Bethesda, you have received the last dollar I will ever spend on your games. Players beware, this game is a bitter pill when you reach the Foundry. Hope you designers had good chuckle, but you lost my money forever."
115942,1,"I was really looking forward to this game, man what a bummer. Now I know I'm in the minority here but it's my take on this game and here it goes.

Well, so far I've put in at least 6 hours...6 hours of agonizing bordom! I just don't get what all the ""hype"" is about. It's almost as if you have to like this game or you're not ""cool"" by the way people talk about it. Guess I'm not cool, I freakin hate this game.

I actually restarted the game to go ith my lowered my expectations and see if I could bare through it. No go.

The pace is so sllooww[...] My god people, how the hell can you deal with this? I would much rather read a good book than play this, it's far more exciting and stimulating.

The graphics are just so-so, nothing great here. The animations pretty much blow, pretty clunky to say the least. AI isn't the greatest either. And it's so wordy, like I said, if I'm gonna spend hours reading I would rather read a book.

Maybe I'm just spoiled when it comes to RPGs having an uber gaming computer and having played some pretty amazing RPGs.

The break down of this game is as follows.

49% Talking
49% Traveling
2% Action/picking up trash

I'm so glad I got it used, I would really be ticked if I wasted $60 on this.

You've been warned."

169525,1,"We bought this game with several others at Christmastime along with a brand new Wii console (so everything is new, nothing is old, everything should work, right?).  Our son loves this game, but it randomly freezes our Wii system.  There is a buzzing noise that travels through the TV speakers, and sometimes the game screen freezes or it just goes black.  The only way to un-freeze the Wii is to unplug it (even the power button on the Wi won't work).

Apparently, from looking at other reviews, this is a problem with this game.  Since it was the most expensive one we bought, it's extra-frustrating that it's the only one that we have had a problem with.

If the game did not freeze (and it does, with absolutely no rhyme or reason-we  can play it for days with no problems, and then, suddenly, it's crashing 3-4 times in a day), we would give this a 5+ stars rating."

160830,1,"O.K.  I will keep it short and sweet.  I thought the idea of brushing up on my opponents psychological profiles and reading dossiers to plan my missions would be fun.......but in reality, none of this mattered at all in the game.  Here are the problems with the game so you don't have to read a long review.  I am only sharing MY opinion and it may not reflect your own, however, it is difficult to imagine a reasonable person would not find the following issues a bit troubling.

1.  Terrible AI always knows where you are.  You can hide behind walls, use stealth and plan your route.  All to no avail.  They will find you without even seeing you.  The cover system is also broken, with constant problems.

2.  Broken battle mechanics.  You're telling me I spent all this time learning of my foes and hacking computers and alarms to need to shoot a hypersensitive  guard who can run 50 mph IN THE HEAD FOUR TIMES before he is eliminated?  When did they invent bullet proof heads?

3.  The hacking and alarm overrides in the game could be fun, if they were not so hard to complete within a reasonable amount of time.  I have nothing against difficulty, it makes a game challenging.  However in this case, they took it a little too far. Be reasonable.

4.  All of the reading and planning missions, even weapon selection have absolutely no bearing on the game as the developer would lead you to believe.

5.  Most of you are going to want the few hours of time you gave to this game back.  They should pay you to play this game."

255022,1,Assassins Creed I does not recognize the XBOX 360 usb controller for the PC the game would like you to use. Assassins Creed II does recognize it. I have found on the internet remarks that indicate the company forgot to include the recognition capability in its first version of Assassins Creed for the PC (switch inputs to keyboard and mouse control to play the game). I much prefer playing the game on the PS3 as this game really sucks for the PC.
151530,1,"Don't waste your time on this game! The game may seem like the next horror video game, but it is not anything good. The games third person camera is horrible, the controls are horrible and at sometimes you find your self mashing the same buttons over and over. The puzzles are completely ridiculous and some levels are hard to get through. The save system is stupid because it saves as ""Episodes"" like a tv show. The episodes are split into parts, and if you are on for example part 1, and you don't finish part 1 or you die, you will have to do it all over again. I am trying to stop you guys from buying this game as I have stopped a guy at Gamestop from buying it. DO NOT BUY THIS!"

203551,1,"""This poor decision of only one save file per cartridge is only part of what is wrong with this game. It is a series of rushed minigames. No wonder 3rd party games don't sell well on Nintendo platforms when they turn out junk like this. Take my advise and boycott Capcom."""
324070,1,"The B-button on the controller I received only works when you mash it. If it was a C-button or something else, I might not care as much, but the B-button being barely functional is a let-down and definitely doesn't allow you to do special moves in Smash 64 or swing your sword in OoT/Majora's Mask, which sucks. On the bright side, you can pretend that Link is an idiot and doesn't know how to effectively swing a sword. I love walking into dungeons basically unarmed.

TL:DR: if you can manage the cost, buy Nintendo brand controllers and other accessories unless you either know the company is reputable or otherwise you know what you're getting when you buy."

456146,1,"Basically, I think this game is really boring. Yeah it has good graphics, WOOPIDEEDOO! That still doesn't make up for the flaws. The gameplay is ok, but kind of confusing to learn at first. Once you learn the controls you can beat up goofy looking robots, OH BOY! If you like that, guess what, you get to do it the whole first half of the game! Then, you can fight more goofy-looking robots, because that's pretty much all you do. So if you like beating up lots and lots of robots, then this game is right for you, otherwise, I suggest you get as far away from this game as possible."

236774,1,"The NFS series has gone downhill since the introduction of NFS Carbon. Gone are the days of beautifully designed circuit tracks (NFS 2, 3, 4, 5), absence of unnecessary cop chases and car tuning.
If you need a game to test your nerves then this is the one. While this game shines in the graphics and sound department, playability is null.

I consider myself a veteran having played games since Doom 1, NFS 1 etc but this game is unplayable. It's no sim mind you but a poorly unbalanced arcade game.
I have not encountered that much challenge in a game unless difficulty was cranked up to hard which I didn't. This on the other hand wouldn't even let me win one race and not because the AI is terribly challenging but because the environment and bad controls make it impossible not to crash. It feels as if your ride gets pulled into incoming traffic like a magnet sometimes appearing like popping up in front of you out of nowhere. Then there's annoying cop chases which IMO are an unnecessary addition to any game that's not called GTA.

This was my last game in the NFS series after other disappointments like Pro Street, Carbon, the original MW and shift."
216853,1,"Okay, I already trade this game in after played for a month. I have 2 move controllers for 2 players mode. You could possibly beat the main Arcade mode in 30 minutes, both Razing Storm and Time Crisis 4. For the rest the game, you will be forced to play the horrible watered-down FPS, Story and Multiplayer Mode. To be honest, if you have ever played FPS games, Battlefield Bad Company 2 or Call of Duty:Modern Warfare 2, this game is a complete garbage. If you go to the Japanese Amazon, this game only has gotten two stars. Even the Japanese customers didn't like what Japanese company made. Whatever happened to the Japanese gaming industry? Everyone plays Monster Hunters 3rd portable on PSP nowadays; they create horrible HORRIBLE console games.

I know I shouldn't compare this game to other popular FPS games since this game is a rail shooter; but, because this game also included both HORRIBLE Story Mode and Multiplayer Mode that's FPS watered-down, I had to compare to the other popular FPS game.

I was a big fan of Time Crisis 2 and Crisis Zone. I probably spent nearly $100 in a period of time at local arcades when I was a kid. Compared to Time Crisis 2, Time Crisis 4 is almost a joke... In addition, Razing Storm is even worse than Time Crisis 4!!!

The only good game in the 3 pack is the Pirates game. Surprisingly, it was the only game that had some quality. I would probably just going to buy the pirates game again if they release it via PSN.

If you are looking for a shooter for the MOVE controllers. I strongly recommend picking up Killzone 3 and MAG! MAG online mode is probably 10X better than this game. Actually, there's no one playing online in Time Crisis Razing Storm, LOL; You could barely find 8 players to start a match. I was ranked on the Leaderboard, ranked 100 after played for 1 day.

This game is a joke consider it's $50. Buy it at your own risk. Wait until the price dropped to $20~$30 dollars."
401753,1,"I bought it at GameStop and let me tell you. It is a disappointment. Is like we had a kind of good game with FIFA 11, then a meh with 12 and 13. Then 14 was AWFUL, but with FIFA 15 I just didn't purchase it from release, until four months ago, it is great and very entertaining. The running and defense gameplay is great.

But you play FIFA 16 and is again worst than FIFA 14 or about the same. No improvement. Don't buy it and save for FIFA 17."
190326,1,"Well, this game did improve a couple things from the first game. Such as the smoke bombs, double hidden blades, and the ability to hire groups to assist you. Other than that, the game is crap. They added a lot more stuff to this game, but none of which is useful or even fun. A lot of missions you do will pretty much require you do it only one way. There are horse race missions...unfortunately the horse controls are still just as clunky as the first one. You will repeatedly jump onto guards when you're just trying to get off a building (real helpful feature *sarcasm*). You get your own town that you can upgrade to get more money...but the only thing you spend money on in the game is weapons, in which, if you never spend money to upgrade your town, you'll have all the money you need to get the weapons you want. Some of those stupid puzzles you do are broken, such as trying to turn the rings to form a picture...but no matter what you do, some rings will turn together and never allow you to complete the picture. I hate the characters. You can literally assassinate 5 guys in a row before you start combat with whoever is left. The maps are busy, so it's hard to tell what's where.
This game also introduced the ability to blend in with crowds to stay hidden from guards. Unfortunately, this feature is broken, and I couldn't even do the introduction mission using that ability. You're suppose to follow the head prostitute around the block by blending in with the crowd and be undetected by the numerous guards. But every single time I tried, the crowd would ALWAYS stray away from her, in which I would either fail by being lead too far away, or I would try to make my way back to her and be caught by a guard. The only way I found to do this mission was to stay close to her while using the rooftops. Really, I tried again and again to do this mission the way they wanted me to, but apparently it is just based off of sheer luck if any crowds manage to go the same direction as her throughout the mission.
I'm sure I missed some stuff, but that's enough of the complaints. The first game concentrated on its strong suits and made you play minimally on its bad parts. Assassin's Creed II does just the opposite. I tried and tried, but the boredom and frustration from this game prevented me from finishing it. Again, almost everything added to the game was useless and stupid."
47999,1,"My bias is that from a Final Fantasy fan.  Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is NOT a Final Fantasy game.  It doesn't even come close to the Legend of Zelda in terms of action/adventure.  It is a waste of time, space, energy, and money.  All together.

I made the regretful mistake of putting this product on my Amazon Wish List when it first came out.  After testing it at stores and reading about it, I quickly realized the game was cheese.  I forgot, however, to remove it from my Wish List.  My brother and sister bought it for me for my birthday one year!  Aye yie yie!

So because of the $50 they scrounged together in my honor, I figured I'd give the game a thorough shot.

I couldn't take it anymore by the time I got to the second level.  It was atrocious.  I felt sorry for the Final Fantasy name and for my relatives for dropping the cash.

Enough of the emotional banter.  Let me try to give an analytical review of this game.

First of all, it does not meet the definition of a classic role-playing game.  (Within the last couple of years, however, I have noticed ""RPG"" taking on a new meaning.  Now it means simply playing as someone else.  Grand Theft Auto, for example, is now classified as an RPG.)  But with today's loose definition of ""RPG,"" you can call it that, I guess.  But I grew up with real RPGs, like Dragon Warrior, the Final Fantasy titles, Lufia, Breath of Fire, etc.  (These were all turn-based RPGs.)

Second, FF:CC does not develop your characters sanely.  Sorry, but whoever programmed this atrocity embarrassed the genre of action/adventure.

Third, I recommend you boycott any GameCube title that requires the use of the Game Boy Advance to play multiplayer.  It is asinine to expect people/kids to pay money for such an inconvenient, expensive, and improper method to simply play with your friends.

Lastly, this game is best suited for gamers who do not like real RPGs but prefer an action game with unique challenges in gameplay.  Yes, FF:CC is an action/adventure, but unlike most others, the gamer will simply have to learn this somewhat different style (it is more hack & slash than anything - the multiplayer functionality should have saved this game from a bad review, but it was disappointing at best).  But other than that, the game will offer essentially ZERO to true RPG gamers, especially those who love the Final Fantasy series.  Stay away from this game if you love Final Fantasy titles."

309774,1,worse game I have ever had.  Mickey Mouse would have been much better.
18424,1,"I enjoy playing these old titles sometimes you find a gem you skipped over, and sometimes you find a turd. This game is a turd.

Remember the earlier days of gaming when the box cover was usually more exciting than the game itself? Well it's pretty much the same thing here.

Hands down the most incredibly difficult game you will probably ever have the opportune chance of playing. Nearly impossible to beat thanks to the games mechanics. You'll at times feel like your trying to take down a tank with a sling shot with the powerless weapon selection they provide you.

The controls aren't that great but they aren't that bad. This is the first time I had to use a cheat code to survive in a game since Duke Nukem... and I mean the original side scroller version. This game is inhumanely difficult. You'll have 2-3 guys attacking you at once. While one is shooting with 100% marksman ship just draining your life away the other(s) will be kicking and punching you and knocking you down. So your getting both beat and shot to death. Sounds like it would be rare but it isn't. This happens 100% of the time when you have one armed and one unarmed opponent mix. Each armed gooned you come across is almost like a mini boss. Your guns will barely phase them while they're guns hit every mark and will kill you even if you jump and run around or try to see cover.

Very poor game mechanics, and pretty inconsistent game play. The music is mundane and the artwork switches from fantastic to what is this supposed to be. Might not matter but in an ""anime"" game what's the reason for having several different artist with multiple renderings of the same character that look different in each one? Sounds like I'm being harsh but I just expected the in game art to look as good as the front cover and the opening scene. Instead it goes from Madhouse to Crayola crayon."
175150,1,"I purchased this after reading reviews of this game and am sorely dissappointed.
The graphics literaly suck and must date back at least eight years. If you are used to such fare as Medal of Honor or Call of Duty, even those that first came out three years ago or more, there is no comparison.
This game would fail to satisfy even if purchased in a clearance bin at 9.95.
Stay away, there are better games out there for less.

The enemy AI even manages to shoot you, while you are hiding behind a building.

The only highlite was the ""Bullet Time"" slow motion, but that is not enough to satisfy even the occational gamer.

Stay away, other games available for less money with a greater fun factor."

256120,1,"My controller failed, in the same way that they have for many others. The left and up on the D-pad failed at the same time as the Square and Triangle buttons failed.

Sony did not bother to replace an obviously failed design version of the early controller, even though it was never dropped, had been exposed to liquid or temperature extremes, and offered no ability to pay for a way to swap it out with a new version.

I highly recommend being wary of this product, if it's an earlier generation model."
228343,1,"I was late to the 3ds party. But this game shouldn't have even came. I wouldn't go as far to sau that is not playable, but it's pretty close"
112979,1,"The title of my review says it all.  At every turn this game was obviously rushed and not polished due to Call of Duty launching on November the 9th.  And no, I'm not a COD fanboy, I just know how the system works.  A huge title that will draw a crowd is a daunting foe in the gaming world.  DICE knew that, and rushed this game to get the maximum amount of sales.

The good about the campaign: The campaign is fun and creative.  The visuals for night vision were impressive and realistic.

The bad about the campaign: The campaign was incredibly short and at times very aggravating.  There were times where someone shouted directions at me and I could not hear them over the gunfire.  Then I'm left wondering if I should move up, flank, follow a comrade, or stay put and defend.  With the lack of good waypoints there are times where you are left confused and frustrated.  Maybe they were going for the realism of warfare?

The good about the multiplayer: I have yet to find one redeeming quality in the multiplayer.  Getting lots of pointless and well designed awards is kinda cool?

The bad about the multiplayer: I will sum up probably 80% of my online experience in this game with two words: Spawn Trap.  This game is so horribly put together for the online gameplay that it makes my head hurt.  All of the maps, with the exception of maybe 2, are so small that you simply need to post up around the other teams spawn to win.  Most of the spawns are in the corner of a map, so you come around a building to mortar fire and sniper bullets.  This means you have 2 choices.  1. Stay put and do nothing but periodically die from mortar and rocket strikes. 2. Attempt to run out in the mass confusion with your other team mates while you get mowed down time after time after time.  The only time I had fun (if you can call it that) and racked up kills was when my team and I returned the favor and spawn trapped the other team.  So you have 2 choices, play like a jerk or get played like a jerk.

Avoid this game, unless you want to rent it and enjoy a fun, fast campaign. Other than that wait for Battlefield Vietnam or Call of Duty if you want a real game."

457701,1,"Had very high hopes for using this corded, and time tested controller in new smash brothers four for Wii U.  Yes it programs commands (I first created two macros for short hopping + instant in air smash as its tricky under fire to pull off).

BE WARNED.  Sadly, the B button on this device - BRAND NEW mind you, is terribly unresponsive and requires really forcing your thumb into what feels like placing a puzzle for the dang button to register. Worse, once you've pressed and are holding down B, the controller doesn't register you holding it down, as it slips around and requires crushing power (following a response delay that cannot be overcome by strength) just to execute any moves than require, uh... B.  I paid as much as a new controller for this, and perhaps note no other issues with any of the buttons - will possibly reconfigure the keys around as in smash having both x and y and the analog pad up serve as a jumping action is a little overkill. Either way, starting from zero this is a letdown of a purchase and my gut tells me no matter how I try to work around it's design flaws this controller won't last very long given poor functionality mint out of the box."

BUT, whoever made Driver 1 thought it way too controversial to make a villian as the lead, so they decided to make it an ""on the run"" police officer.  that was weak and i lost interest in it, don't care how great the game was.  do i want a watered down version of an artist's vision?  please, why don't you put that fig leaf on ""David""'s unit in Florence.
So, here we go, now we have driv3r, a couple years after the GTA wave breaks.  yay!  in driv3r they finally let you get out of the car and do foot missions, fight, shoot, run over people, now that the coast is clear.  there is nothing innovative about what they are trying to do here.  driv3r is not the original.  any company that forfeits it's edginess to be politically correct will not get my money.  might as well have tipper gore in the passenger seat the whole time, telling tanner what he could and could not do."

361883,1,"I loved the Tom Clancy series. Couldn't wait to open this up. Where the heck is the single player campaign mode?  I''m not a big fan of multiplayer. I was looking forward to a campaign, COD style. What I got for single player is cheezy 'situations' where you get points. Seems like Ubisoft took the lazy way out on this one. Even the first cut scene is short and lame.

Aiming is a challenge  too. Almost  impossible to get a head shot. So disappointed. This game is going back where it came from.

I noticed the new Star Wars game omitted the campaign mode as well. Not sure if this is the direction game makers are going. If it is, count me out. So now, I'm going to have to really research each game to see if it's really a game at all or just salad dressing for slow servers.

Not sure why so many are comparing this to Call of Duty. I just played Advance Warfare and it's a masterpiece compared to Siege. One of the best, most engaging campaigns I've ever played. COD rocks."

158445,1,"this has got to be one of the worst wii games i ever played, even worse than trauma center. where do i start?
for one its hard to control despite how simple the controls are, some of the challenges in the beginning of the game are nearly impossible to beat and the rating system. i thought it would be fair if the performance rating would average each rating such as turning and speed together, but no thats not the case, it takes the lowest grade and makes it the final grade, so if i got an A grade in everything and a D in turning, my overall grade would be a d. another thing, you are rated on how much you turn, which makes no sense because theres no reason to turn excessively  on courses where you are going straight down, or courses that require little turning, you should only turn as much as you need to. i have had it with this game.
how is this game so easy yet so hard, well when one of the training courses kept failing me cause i did not turn enough despite me turning the entire time. it was relatively easy to control cause i was getting used to the balance board, but it was failing me even though i did it right.

it is not all bad, i kind of like how when im playing the game at night time i have the option to choose to play the game in the night time setting, but thats not saying much.

i am usually the one not to complain about video game graphics, but these are just so bad, in some cases the graphics can get worse than the n64, like when people talk.

another problem i have with this game is the lack of wii remote usages, all you to is push down to speed up and wiggle your arms in mid air do do a random airborne trick. i was not expecting much out of we ski, but i did not know it would be this horrible."

126578,1,"I live in China but it's not my mother tongue. All I want to do is play Starcraft II on the local Chinese servers in English. This was possible in Starcraft: Brood War, released in 1998. In fact, playing on any server in any available language was possible. But Activision-Blizzard does not allow cross-region play for Starcraft II. They don't even let you play on a LAN with your friends, which means some amount of lag is always going to be present, even if you're right next to your opponent. All of this was doable 12 years ago. Activision-Blizzard has never satisfactorily explained why these features have not been implemented in Starcraft II.

The end result is that the community has been balkanized based on country and language. And if you happen to live in a region that doesn't support your language, or want to play someone from another country or region, well, tough luck. This game is not for you."

And the vampires? One hit your dead.

48108,1,"With the exception of Budokai, Dragon Ball Z games often fare poorly. DBZ: Taiketsu, sadly, joins their dismal ranks. If nothing else, Taiketsu succeeds somewhat in capturing the simple visual charm of the show. The large characters look clear and visible on the tiny GBA screen, but overall they can't compete with the superior graphics of GBA champions MK:DA and Street Fighter, and Taiketsu's herky-jerky animation is also particularly distracting. To save battery juice, go ahead and mute the muffled background music and scratchy sound effects-since the game lacks character voices, you won't miss anything important. Taiketsu's button-mashing gameplay is shallow and simplistic, even for a kid's fighting title. There are 15 characters total, including favorites from both the series (like Cell and Goku) and the movies (including the popular Brolly). Aside from the occasional super-move, each character boasts only a meager handful of attacks and combos. Worse, there's very little difference between the various fighters. Players can also occasionally take to the skies during combat, but that gimmick burns out quickly. On the plus side, the game thoughtfully includes several play modes (like Tournament and Endurance) to help extend the replay value; unfortunately, none of the game types are interesting or particularly enjoyable. Another nice touch is the Soul Calibur-esque secret system, which allows players to earn Z Points to unlock bonus modes, settings, and pictures. Overall, unless you're an eight-year-old DBZ fanatic, you'll find that this Saiyan is hardly super."
162856,1,"I just feel the need to get here and drop this warning, DON'T BUY without play the DEMO, I just grab demo from PSN store and this game IS SO BAD I don't have words for it, except it have some pretty graphics, that's all, game ends there, on graphics.

Incredible how SEGA, supposing they spent some million to develop a game and this is the final result !?!?!? Where's the quality ? And gameplay ? Did anyone of the testers (if SEGA as any) liked this gameplay or even play it ??

Shame, many will end buying this game without previous warning. DON'T BUY IT."
100428,1,"I was a HUGE fan of the first couple Tenchu games on Playstation. Then they just kept on tossing out cheap ports packaged as ""new games"". No innovation, no updating the experience, just the same old stuff with slightly new level maps. Now, with the Xbox 360, they have released YAT ANOTHER cheap port of the same old game. The graphics are awful for a 360 game, the controls are clunky and slow, the level maps are ridiculously lame looking and un-detailed, the bad guys are just as stupid and dense as they were on the Playstation 1. I wish people would stop buying these games so that the developer would be forced to take a hard look at the franchise and either stop making it or properly update it and make a good game. The first couple were so fun and tense, real white knuckle gaming. Then it just got boring. Not taking advantage of the potential on the 360 is just stupid and I feel sorry for people who basically threw away $60 on a game that is not worth $10."
49916,1,The game is not cool it is not callngin like the odd parnts game bay that.
308880,1,"Thought I'd try this again after a few months - it's actually gotten worse.  Hardly anyone plays online, and those that do are clans.  So, if you're playing solo, expect to have a horrible experience.  If you can get into a match at all.  Matchmaking can sometimes take longer than playing the actual match.  Even playing against bots (wargame), you will wait and wait and wait for enough players to join.  And all the terrible game mechanics are still there; spawning in front of enemy bullets, getting killed 6 feet around corners, lag, frame drops, glitches, host migrations... the list goes on and on.  This game truly deserves zero stars.

FINAL ANALYSIS: It's boring, frustrating, and oftentimes maddening.  Activision insults us by forcing these horrible maps on us with the release and then tries to sell us the 'good' maps in a DLC.  And now these new weapons (Maverick and Ripper) feel like pay to win.  Maybe they'll sell perks like ""no-host-disadvantage"", ""frag-the-lag"", ""shoot-first-kill-first!"", and ""dedicated-servers-for-dedicated-players"".  I'm being only half-sarcastic; I really can see this happening, especially with the cast of clowns at Activision.  COD is dead to me now and forever.  Time to move on!

UPDATE2: Not only do they keep pushing the cruddy maps (Free Fall has been made universal, so it's coming up MUCH more often), but I seem to be getting host a lot now.  What happened to dedicated servers?!  The game has gotten so bad I'm only playing Squads now.  But even playing against bots is frustrating - they camp just as hard, but they have built-in aimbot and they appear to see through walls.  IW must really want us to buy the DLC for those small and medium maps as they keep pushing the large ones.  Well, no thanks - I'm speaking with my wallet and refusing to buy anymore from IW.  I'm going back to BLOPS2, along with thousands of others.  As of this morning, there were only 40K playing.  Dropping my star rating from 2 to 1.  It's that bad now.

UPDATE1: I don't know what Activision is doing, but they seem intent on pushing every one of their bad maps at me, over, and over, and over again.  Siege, Sovereign, Stonehaven, Chasm - it's a never ending repeat cycle. And there are so few players on - just today, it was 45K.  Worldwide.  So, finding a match without a large ping is hard to come by.  And it shows.  This game is absolutely no fun.  I'm dropping it from 3 to 2.

The graphics ARE better in the single and multiplayer modes.  However, in MP mode, I do find the extra shading and lighting effects to be distracting and makes it even harder to see the enemy - dark corner McDougal's are even darker!  And the beams of lights blind you - almost as bad as a flash bang.  More deaths that can be attributable to map design, yay.

I do notice much less stuttering/lost frames, thanks to the power of the PS4.  But lag compensation will always be with us.  Still too many deaths from invisible enemies.  At least the game is appropriately named - I often feel like I'm shooting at ghosts (bullets don't seem to hit at all) or being shot at by ghosts - bullets hitting me out of thin air.

So, this game is just slightly better in the PS4 version.  Is it worth the $10 upgrade if you have the PS3 version?  Sure, why not.  But it's still only a 3/5."

- good sound quality
- comfortable

NEUTRAL
- not really completely wireless. this is more likely MS's fault than anyone else. if they're not going to figure out Bluetooth then they need to figure out a no latency wireless protocol or other tech to get rid of ALL the damn wires. They get tangled up when you store them away and it's REALLY annoying. The additional adapter that plugs into the bottom of the controller is additionally annoying. It's 2015, figure it out.
- no feedback/monitoring (you can't hear yourself). MS's own headset also has this problem. Again, it's 2015. What the hell is this about? You'll be yelling to hear yourself. People that are hard-of-hearing do this. It's annoying to you and you'll be annoying to other people so that's doubly annoying.
- the color scheme / style doesn't really feel like it matches that of the Xbox. The black might pass, be the other colors don't make any sense. The green stripe in the white set doesn't match any Xbox green in their color scheme...like some jackass in marketing just said ""what color should we make it?"" and some other idiot said ""green....those xbox jerks like green."" ""what type of green?"" ""bah, doesn't matter...let's just shove it out the door."" I guess this is nitpicky but I'm not sure why? not many after-market brands out there seem to be able to figure out these very difficult concepts like color and paint.

CON
- firmware was necessary just to get things working somewhat (didn't fix the mic problem however). for a  $100+ set, this seem rather lousy.
- The mic is not near your mouth so it would need to be EXTRA sensitive. It isn't. They screwed this up so bad they had to release an extra attachment to get it to work properly. I registered 2 of these headsets at polk.com, but over a month later, nothing arrived. I had to call to get them to send something and they still haven't. It would help if they would show a picture of this boom mic thing so I could see what it looks like and try to conceive of how it might help (or be yet another additional problem). Since the original mic is designed to be retractable, I assume this boom attachment will stick out and render the retractibility useless.
- Separately from the mic's insensitivity is the pressure required to get it to retract or release. I nearly sent my first set back because I had to press down so hard to get it to stick (retract inside) I thought I might break it. I thought it was broken because it wouldn't stick. A 2nd set also had this problem.
- For whatever reason, the mic didn't initially seem to work at all on either set. Flat out no response. Then after retracting and multiple times it magically worked. Will it stop working at some point? Is the connection loose? It's really hard to have faith in this product.

I tested this set with what everyone uses: Call of Duty, regular Xbox chat, Titanfall, Halo, etc...

NOTE
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU READ IN OTHER REVIEWS OR THE Q&A, NEITHER OF MY 2 HEADSETS CAME WITH THE BOOM MIC. BOTH WERE IMMEDIATELY REGISTERED WITH POLK BUT I HAD TO CALL THEM TO GET THEM TO SEND AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T. DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO AUTOMATICALLY SEND IT TO YOU. POLK REQUESTS/REQUIRES PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS WHEN YOU REGISTER. WHY PHONE NUMBER? THAT'S EXCESSIVE. THERE WAS NO ""THANKS FOR REGISTERING YOUR POLK PRODUCT"" VERIFICATION EMAIL, SO THAT SEEMED POINTLESS. WILL I NOW RECEIVE PHONE OR EMAIL SPAM? WHO KNOWS...

POLK
I own several Polk speakers and they're solidly built and work reasonably well especially considering the price. They should not have rushed this product out the door. They clearly didn't test it well enough and they obviously don't have enough (or any) experience in multiplayer gaming audio. This headset fiasco kind of tarnishes their brand just a little...Stick with Turtle Beach, Astro, the brands that have some experience and proven track records...Polk's first foot forward into gaming is a stumble...

Skip this headset. Too many problems. Too much rigmarole to deal with considering the $100+ price tag...Can't even tell you whether the boom makes anything better over a month later because I still don't have it...That's silly considering the return window to Amazon would already be closed for my 1st set..."

60279,1,"My Son and I play Final Fantasy XI on various systems (PC, Workstations, Playstation 2, and Playstation 3).  My primary access is a Dell Precision 390 workstation using this controller.  I also use the same controller on a Dell Laptop (Inspiron 9300).  This is a GREAT controller when it works, but thus far they die quickly.  Over the years I bought 5 of them and thus far only 2 of them are working.

When I contacted Logitech for support, they turned me down because Amazon.com won't provide warranty support unless you have a paper receipt.  The only receipt I have when buying from Amazon.com is what I show on my screen.  I did a copy and paste and even turned it into a PDF file (for printing), but the Logitech employee said it could be a fake.

When I contacted Amazon.com about getting a paper receipt, the first person said she'd send me a new controller.  When it didn't arrive, I called and another person said the first person exceed her authority, as it broke after the 30th day (or maybe it was the 2 week mark).  So, I'm stuck with a controller no one will fix even though it died during the warranty period.

As for the other two dead controller, they died somewhere between the 14th and 18th month.  I didn't even try to get them fixed, exchanged, or my money back.

I don't know of a better controller when it is work, which is why I keep coming back.  I hope people out there have some suggestions.  I also hope someone from Logitech reads this and has a solution for Amazon.com customers!!  Logitech should honor their warranty even if we buy through Amazon.com!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
417971,1,Worst Legend of Zelda game I have ever played. How can this abomination be considered canon but Hyrule Warriors isn't?
305064,1,"Here has been my experience with this game so far:

1. Pre-ordered the game and got a $20 coupon for Origin, but they never told you that you can only spend that coupon on a limited number of games and had to spend $30 total on the order. Then they price games at .99 so you can't hit exactly $30 and have to spend at least $40.

2. The servers were constantly going down and I was constantly getting ""Unable to connect, please try again"".

3. The tutorial would constantly reset so when I could finally connect to the servers, I would have to do the tutorial all over again before playing the main game.

4. When finally entering a main game, I would build a few roads and then the game would crash to the desktop.

5. EA told me over the phone that they won't give me a refund, and if I try to seek a refund in any other way they will ban my account from Origin. That means I wouldn't be able to play ANY of my Origin games and would have to either buy them all over again or never use Origin again. It would be the latter.

I plan to never buy an EA game again, which really sucks because a lot of good game studios are under the EA banner, but it just isn't worth this aggravation anymore..."
305009,1,"If you buy EA products you support this always online  requirement garbage.

410849,1,not that great of a game...
439413,1,"First the pros.  The graphics and sound are great.

Now the cons.  It's buggy as hell.  The single-player is basically a glorified training campaign.  The weapons are ridiculously unbalanced.  There are few maps.  The new operations mode is stupidly short.  The whole game is about as arcade as it gets.  It's a shame really.  To build such realistic looking scenery, then have a bunch of 12 year old jackards running around like cokehead supermen is just a joke.  I don't know why I was expecting something else.  No joystick support on PC?  WHAT?  That is unforgivable.

I wrote a much longer review, but deleted it as I wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not happy that I spent my money on this.  I know the initial reviews of this game were glowing, but I think once people get past the high production value, they'll see a thin and inconsistent game with debilitating bugs and balancing issues.  I may revisit it after they've had months to work out the issues, but there are too many issues right now to warrant much time spent playing this game.

Wait for it to go on super sale like the rest of the Battlefield series.  It'll be less than 50% the cost within 6 months."

There are a lot of stupid side quest, which I could not stand. It drove me nuts.

I didn't think the graphics were all the great, ok I guess, and the story line sucked. I did not enjoy the battle system.

214696,1,"Have spent dozens, maybe hundreds of hours, dealing with the myriad problems I've dealt with this machine since 1 month in, when I got the dreaded but all too common red lights of death and had to send it into Microsoft.  I'll just list all the problems:

1) Red lights of death a month into ownership, after not having so much as scratched it and with moderate use.  Talked to Microsoft then had to send it into them.  Took 2 months for them to send me a refurb replacement.

2) from the moment I got the replacement, my game discs would not load correctly one third of the time, for which I have to eject disc, manually reposition, then re-insert.

3) Halo 3 map pack which I purchased separately not loading, except for one day (7 on the 7th for those who played Halo 3) of the month.  After hours of trying to figure out problem on the phone with MS reps, no resolution.

4) Xbox controller sticky analog shift only 6 months in, still no fix

5) Windows media player unable to sync

6) Not all codecs for Video Player downloading

7) Netflix requiring you to manually input your username and password each time you log in because I used a different Netflix account to log in initially (this only happens on the Xbox). Extermely annoying.

8) LOUD fan.  So loud I finally had to put it behind my bureau and cover/surround it with blankets,pillows just so the noise which is still loud is bearable.  Then it overheats and I get one red light of death (only one Microsoft?)

Each of these problems required scouring the Internet for possible solutions, talking to MS reps on phone, then physically attempting to fix the problem if applicable.  MS reps are completely oblivious, takes at least half an hour to wait and have to explain the problem before they even understand what the problem is.  In addition, when my Xbox Live subscription expired they attempted to do a bait and switch by first offering me 1 month for $1 and then another year for $20 on phone, I learned later it was $30 and they of course had no record of the conversation and talked as though *i* was the one who tried to ip them off.  No joke.

I've given up playing games and at this point I just wanted something to watch videos and video apps on my TV. Because of above problems, I can't.

I will have to buy a PS3 very soon.

For not only the money but of equal importance the time, energy and stress i spent on the myriad problems, i strongly recommend against buying it, as 54% - yes, more than half - of all Xboxes malfunction.  And that's not counting the smaller problems like map packs not loading or Netflix requiring you to log on each time that will cause you endless hassle.

I will never buy an Xbox again, whether this generation or the next.

90435,1,"First of all I played this game from classic until Firelands raid, which was released in Cataclysm. I wish I had quit sooner, but kept hoping they would release content that was fun again. It is worth noting I have done quite a bit of progression raiding, had 11 level 85 characters, and had most achievements completed on my main as well when I stopped playing.

You pay for the game, the expansions, and basically pay them for the full cost an expansion again every 3 months of subscription fees. And then they do things like leave intentionally low population servers open so if you can't find a decent guild on your server it is another $25 (per character, so if you have alts you want to bring it is more) to transfer servers which doesn't actually cost Blizzard anything... This game is completely designed around bleeding the money out of your pocket.

Once you are max level the game wastes as much of your time as possible on repetitive tasks such as daily quests, daily instances, farming materials, achievements that require grinding rather than skill, etc. Raiding requires either a lot of materials or a lot of gold. One great addition was cauldrons to reduce the need for farming once your guild level was high enough to give it more uses and whatnot, but they do still take a lot of materials.

The daily quests and instances (I think the instances are weekly now, but require you to do an average of 1 per day) are also somewhat necessary for progression raiding for quite awhile after content releases because of the rewards they give. Running the exact same instances that you have cleared countless times with a random group every week is not only mind numbingly boring and time consuming, but you also get stuck with either horrible players, jerks that que'd together with the intention of screwing everyone else over, or a group that already kicked someone and has afk members. (If you leave you get a half hour debuff, if you don't you can't get rid of the afk people.)

Finally there is raiding. This used to be what made WoW a great game. I remember in classic killing a new boss was actually an accomplishment. Raids had 20-40 people in them which made the fights much more complex, but fun. The content itself was also much more difficult and more fun. After classic they switched to a 10/25 man raid format. Since Cataclysm they made the gear in 10 man exactly the same as 25 with easier bosses in 10. They also took the lazy way in instance design by making the higher end raids heroic modes of the same exact instance and bosses. Most good guilds beat normal content within a week of it's release... meaning the rest of the time until next content release is just repeating the same content on a higher difficulty. To me that is very boring and just lazy on Blizzard's part. Even the gear models stay the same, all the items look the same on higher difficulties but have higher stats. They used to release multiple raid instances and once you beat one you would move on to the more difficult one instead of just repeating the same thing."

451195,1,"Let me start off by saying that back in the day of the Super Nintendo, I did own Gradius 3 and had an absolute blast with it. The game's graphics, music and gameplay were standout gorgeous, I loved it. Granted, I have never played Gradius 4 but figured it would be just as good if not better than the G3 that I remember from back in the day. The versions on this PS2 console are an embarrassment to the PS2's capability. Granted, even though this game was released somewhat early in the PS2's era, I simply can't believe that a system that can play games like Resident Evil 4 and God of War I and II could put out something this hacked.

Now, before I say anything let me just say that the G3 on this disc is NOT THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION! So if you are like me and wanted to play that game again, you can forget it. Dont pay any attention to all these ridiculous positice 5-star reviews on this site. I have no idea what kind of drugs these other gamers are on or  they probably work for Konami directly.
This is SUPPOSED to be a straight arcade port, but I can't imagine the arcade version looking and playing this terribly... and I was right! I went as far as to check Youtube videos of both the SNES and arcade versions and they BOTH look significantly better than this game. So judging from that, this game isn't even a straight arcade port of G3... so what version is this exactly??? I have no idea. Seems like some extremely poor rushed port of the arcade version that plays more like an emulated game with extremely pixaleted graphics that look as if they belong on the original NES. Things are just too uneven, the objects are too big and the ships and enemies have probably like 2 or 3 colors at most. Overall, it looks terrible. I was shocked because after the really cheap looking presentation I was afraid that my worst fear was true, that this was not the SNES version. For that game, it seems that Konami made it a point to overhaul the gameplay and graphics when bringing the original arcade version home to make it more ""home friendly"", and they did an absolutely excellent job of doing so. G3 for the SNES game looked and played about 3X better than the original arcade version. I'm not sure why Konami, being the same company that brought the SNES version knowing FULL WELL it was superior to the arcade, decided instead bring the more substandard arcade version to the PS2 instead of their SNES classic. Not to also mention that the PS2 has about 3 or 4 times the graphical horsepower that the SNES had! It's like, are you kidding me??? Again, it was a rush job and an absolute embarrassment to them. Shame on Konami for not having the common sense to AT THE VERY LEAST just port the SNES version over. If you ask me, this should've been an overhauled and updated version of the SNES version! Who even cares about the arcade version of G3??? I wish I can say some redeeming things about the game, but if the game isn't even ARCADE perfect, what's the point? This is just an humiliating rush job that was just put out to meet demand. Even the voice acting prompts in the game that state what power up you use sound severely weak. Konami decided to forgo the cheesy sounding ""kill/destroy them all!"" and ""You need more practice"" bits out of the SNES versions, and on here they just sound annoying and stupid and completely unfitting to the game's atmosphere.
Now considering Gradius 4, there isn't much difference. The G4 version on this disc does look and play a BIT better than the G3 version. But from my memory G4 wasn't brought home on any console, so we really only have the arcade version to go by. Whether this is an ACTUAL arcade port of the game I'm not really sure because I didn't bother researching G4 on Youtube or anywhere else to make a comparison. Granted, even so, the game does move a BIT faster and gameplay is a bit smoother and there isn't that disgusting pixelated look to the game, but overall G4 is just a small step better than G3. I feel no real desire to return to either game, and would much rather just buy a used copy of G3 for the SNES instead. To add insult to injury, the games don't even have a continue feature with them. Nope, you basically have to beat these games in a single sitting with your measly 3 lives (and 5 if you change it on the options menu), and considering how badly these games play, don't even bother putting it on anything harder than ""Very Easy"" mode. You won't get anywhere.

Save your money, and if you're a Gradius fan, I would suggest either getting an NES to play the original, an SNES for G3 and for your PS2 go out and spend the extra for Gradius 5 which is a completely new version of Gradius that actually decides to USE the PS2's graphical power. But avoid this rush job at all costs!"

Missing the humor and overall vibe you expect with the Red Alert series. I would still purchase the game if not for the DRM scheme. EA, learn your lesson. This is not going to be a successful model.

138947,1,"The game is fun for a little while, the story is boring and seems like it was written by a 13 year old who is writing a short story for class.  As for the game, the item grind is not really an item grind. YOU will not find any items worthwhile, your only bet to get great gear is playing the stock market aka auction house.  You buy low sell high so you can buy something else.  That's where you will spend half your time, hoping to find that rare item much cheaper than all the rest and then selling it for a profit. So you can buy another item that you'll use for 5 levels before it becomes obsolete.  Rinse and Repeat, so if you're looking for a great economics simulator this is it.  But be warned fun runs out fast."

Inside (because I wanted to see if I could adjust the wore dwn joysticks) the battery is just loosely hanging there, as are all of the parts. Don't buy this, save for a dualshock 3.

159391,1,"Wow EA really jacked this one up. Sims 2 was probably the single greatest wide interest game ever made. Appealing to everyone from 8 year old kids to baby-boomers, there was so much right about the game (ease of use, the fun of designing and building custom houses, the excellent expansion packs, the fantastic user made content, etc.) that perhaps it would be unfair to expect Sims 3 to be better than Sims 2. However, I AT LEAST expected it to be playable, and reasonably similar to Sims 2 in quality and fun. To sum up the rest of this review: It's nowhere close. It stinks. It's unplayable due to crashes (for me at least). It's a buggy, unfun, massive step backwards from Sims 2.

So what makes it so bad?

First off, the game crashes nearly constantly. It is not my computer. I own and successfully play dozens of computer games including the most graphics intensive on the market. (For the nerds, I have a i7 processor, 6gb ram, and crossfired ATI HD4870s). These problems are due to buggy code and terrible beta testing. This game should never have been released in this state of unfinished unplayability.

They have also removed many of the things I liked best about Sims two like the ability to construct a neighborhood from scratch and then play each family and watch your Sims interact, make friends and enemies, get married to each other, etc... You are now forced to play a single family at a time. Start a new family and your old ones become NPCs (non player controlled) characters. You can never go back once you start a new one. Why EA, why? This singlehandedly ruined the game for me.

Next is the drastic step backwards in ease and fun of playability. Why they decided to jack with the control mechanisms that every Sims 2 player is accustomed to, or slow time down to the point that I started falling asleep watching my Sim sleep with nothing to do in the game to keep me interested, and why EA released the game with a deplorably low number of home furnishings, I don't know. It's like a horrible nightmare where instead of games progressing and improving, they're regressing towards oblivion. The menus are just clumsy, hard to use, and so very much worse than Sims 2. If you loved the Sims 2 menus, you will HATE these.

The camera is also bad, in that sort of early generations Nintendo 64 way where you can never get it to do what you want it to do with regularity. It seems to have a mind of its own, and controlling it is as frustrating as the terrible controls.

Making attractive Sims is about as easy as sculpting the masterpiece David from play dough. All my Sims look fat, ugly, and just not what I had in mind. It is Uber hard to get a face the way you want it to look. It is even harder to make a nice looking Sim than the character creation system in Oblivion: The Elder Scrolls. If you like plump, slightly froggish looking Sims, you'll love it.

For interior design, rather than giving you a solid and complete set of home furnishings, you are instead offered very few selections, but the ability to make them patterned. Oh joy! What I really want is about 6 options of sofas, most of them ugly, but that I can apply plaid or camouflage skins to! That's so much better than having say 12 sofa varieties right? Not so much. This strikes me as either laziness, or that EA released the game intentionally sparse so they can sell even more add on packs later. Except they missed the entire point: the reason they sold so many add on packs for Sims 2 was that the core game was so good!

Overall this might be one of the worst failures in modern PC game history. Destroying a famed (even legendary) series of games like the Sims franchise by changing core elements and just doing a flat out poor job of quality control is abysmal. EA will need to heavily patch this game to make it worth playing, and by the time they do that, it might be too late.

My recommendation: sell your copy on an auction site. At least then you can get back some of your money and buy something else."

Next, the ""driver disc"" that came with the package could not be read by both PCs. How am I supposed to install the drivers if the driver disc is defective? Stay far, FAR away from this thing!"

323780,1,"I can't even begin to express how disappointing this game is. I first started up the game at midnight last night when it was released. I was impressed by the sound quality and by how fast the game ran. Loading screens were short, too. It immediately plopped me into Create-a-Sim, as if I were making a character for a single character game such as Skyrim or Dragon Age. That was different.

I immediately went into options and noticed something disturbing. There were almost no options for anything except graphics settings. The Sims has never been the best at providing a decent options menu (e.g., no custom keys) but this was even worse. You'd think they were trying to IMPROVE the game.

After this foreshadowing of what was to come (lack of options!) I started creating my first Sim. I was very excited for this Create-a-Sim that included dragging facial features to adjust them but honestly it was disappointing. Not only is the color wheel gone, but the colors selections are boring and horrible, especially for hair and skin. I can't say that there are too few hairstyles and clothing options because that's how it was in previous Sims games before expansions/DLC and mods. The face adjustment is a -slight- improvement over sliders but it really does NOT give you the ability to create more unique sims! It only makes it easier. It is VERY limited. For example, I was trying to adjust eyebrows and found that it kept putting a limit on how far I could move them up/down/out etc. It was extremely annoying.

I finished creating my sim with his clay-like hair and entered the game. This is where things got even worse. There are not only two neighborhoods but they are TINY! When I play the sims, I like to create a lot of them. Usually 20-30 of them, such as a few families and a lot of singles that I love to interact with and see who gets paired off, who stays single, etc. There are so few lots that I couldn't do this now. The grouping of lots and constant loading screens are annoying. There are so many things missing and not just what you'd normally expect from a Sims base game. I was bored within 2 hours. All that TS4 did was make me want to go play TS2 and TS3, which is exactly what I did after a few hours.

This is really a step BACKWARDS. When you make a sequel to a game it should be an IMPROVEMENT, removing or fixing previously bad/extraneous features and adding new ones, not dumbing everything down. For example, The Elder Scrolls series. Although Morrowind was arguably better than Oblivion, Bethesda always tries to add MORE to each new game. From Arena to Skyrim, the series has improved each time, with more graphics, better dungeons, more content, better combat, better music, better modding opportunities, etc. (Minus the always prevalent BUGS.)

EA could learn from Bethesda. Stop making your sequels worse. Make them better. ADD to the game. Fix what was wrong with the previous games. Don't take away the things that people enjoyed and give them very little in return!

Save your money on this one. Save it for the potentially awesome titles coming out in the next 6 months - the new Civilization game, Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire remakes, Dragon Age Inquisition, Pillars of Eternity, Tides of Numenera, Borderlands... Don't spend your $60-70 on this!"
439408,1,"This is incredible, this game has a ridiculous graphics downgrade after update. EA needs to fix this otherwise they will rouing the great game this was at lunch.

409327,1,"I don't like the setting. Its like the 1800s, they have magic but use really old guns. Make it more futuristic where the bad guys are wearing like hi-tech armour and amazing weapons you can steal.

Dialogue is really old-fashioned and nowhere near enough swearing, should be brought up to date get with the times! Nowhere did I hear a hoo haa! in battle or any cool jokes because this game tries to be too serious.

No cover system. If you are getting attacked you cant hide behind cover and shoot from behind a wall like the greats. Put in a cover system so we can see whats happening and like handle the suckers who are trying to take us down!

Stealth - I really don't like and other players hate it too, so they should remove this and just like let us play with some silenced weapons at the most. They call me the ninja cos I bust a cap in you before you see me! But with reflex actions obviously, Im nowhere near cowardly enough to hide and shoot someone like.

Mac's driver is just not working on macOS Sierra (10.12.1).
Driver has updated latest and got worth.

Light does not turn off when Mac went to sleep. Solution is that pull out cable.

Driver software(Razer Synapse) does not initialize keyboard and mouse properly after OS launched.
Solution is that you need to open Razer Synapse manually and open Keyboard and Mouse setting every time.

Keyboard got sticky sometimes by software. Solution is just undo. If you cannot undo some software, you are out.

Mouse left click gets compromised as right click.
Solution is pull out mouse and keyboard cable and plug again. Only sometime it works.

Some wrong frequent input from keyboard or mouse, that makes active window inactive.
How can I use this?

It took to type this review over 20 min by plug out and plug in again and again.

Last option is reboot OS and hope recovered.

Better option is avoid their product on Mac.

81395,1,"The worst bug apparently is limited to importing characters from original Dungeon Siege 2. Many (truly) folks, including me, can't even play the game because there is a limit to the number of characters, and this bug prevents you from switching characters in your group. For example, I tried to play a multiplayer party mode in which the limit was 3 characters. One early quest requires you to make a dwarf a member of your group. When you need to get your original party members back, the only way to do that is to release this dwarf to the Inn. When you do that, the game quits and when you start again, that character is gone from the game. There are many other problems related to this bug. This happened with both of my imported DS2 characters.

I would normally expect a patch to resolve this problem from the developers, but apparently the thinking is that this won't happen unless you import corrupted save files. My understanding is that they have not been able to figure out how these files get corrupted, even though they have been trying a long time. So I will be pleasantly surprised if they do find a way to fix this problem, but I'm not holding my breath.

In my opinion, the quality of Dungeon Siege 1 and Legends of Aranna was much better than anything after that, and Broken World is aptly named."

13886,1,"I loved the size of the new PSTwo, but it is still overpriced.  You can buy an Xbox for this price.  Even though the Xbox is larger, it has a more powerful processor and comes with a harddrive so you don't need to shell out even more money for memory cards such as playstations require.  True playstation has a larger number of games, but xbox has many high quality games coming out in the next few months.  Such as Fable, Halo 2, MechAssault 2: Lone wolf ect.

Pros.

475528,1,"Dragon Rising definitely has to be one of the worst game sequels I've ever played in my life.
The original Operation Flashpoint and its two expansions were awesome games that gave a nice taste of military tactics, shooting, driving and flying military vehicles, etc.

Dragon Rising has almost none of the components that made the original game so amazing.
This is basically just a first person shooter with a couple team mates to control, bare bones, and that's it, nothing more.
The graphics are absolutely abysmal. The game is so dark and muddy looking, it's really difficult to make out any detail at all. The draw distance is awful. The controls are clunky, the character movements are clunky. There is no fun to be had in this attrocious failure of a game. I just seriously cannot believe how bad this game really is, I mean wow!

I love military sims and this has to be the worst of any I've come across. Dragon Rising looks like a playstation 2 game and plays like a playstation one game. And once again the graphics, those god awful muddy graphics! In a military sim, it's a necessity to have decent graphics because much of the gameplay involves observing your surrounding environments for enemy forces. Good luck doing that in this game without permanently injuring your eyes from constantly straining them to make stuff out in the distance.

125995,1,"This is coming from a long time fan of the series. I purchased this game the day it came out, I beat the single player campaign and have spent at least a dozen hours playing online.

After being a big Star craft fan for so long I was psyched about this when it came out. I bought the original Star craft (with the zerg box) on the day it came out and I beat it 3 or 4 times, played the online for awhile and got many years of enjoyment out of it. So when Starcraft 2 came out it was a no brainer that I wanted it. Well much to my dismay part 2 is by far the inferior of the two games in just about every way possible. So Ill just give reasons why below I did not like Starcraft 2.

1) You do not ever get to explore the maps, create your own strategy or play how you want in the single player campaigns. Every single player map basically tells you what to do exactly and almost how to do it, the game holds your hand the entire time and guides you everywhere and giving you a cue every time something needs to be done. The entire game is literally a giant tutorial and nothing else. I never felt like I had a chance to explore, to set up defenses, to try and use strategy or anything on my own. Like for instance when you earn the ability to get siege tanks its because you ""find"" them on a mission, I use find loosely as its unavoidable to find them and then the rest of the map is setup specifically designed to let you use the siege tanks to win and doing so otherwise just doesn't work. Or one where again you ""find"" a vehicle and have to stop these trains, well unless you use the vehicles you ""found"" against the train you won't win. Every map is staged so you have exactly what you need and every map has a specific pre-designed way of beating it. They are all exactly as small as possible so you don't wander off and do something dumb like play your way. Every single player map is like playing a game of chess where the pieces are setup for you already and the only way to win is to do things the way a diagram laid out for you says.

2) Blizzards amazing story cut scenes are designed horribly. You'd think this was gears of war in space because all the men are these giant bulked out muscled guys that have to weigh 400lbs of pure muscle with arms so big that they are bigger than my torso. I thought we would get away from the chris redfield of resident evil 5 and gears of war school of character design. This is a little gripe yes but it kind of ruins my ability to suspend disbelief when every male in the game (aside from the skinny nerdy guy) look like they are smuggling car fenders on their clothes.

3) I still dislike that I paid 60 bucks for 1/3 of a game. I know blizzard said many times that they couldn't put all of the campaigns in here due to time and so on. But I look back at Starcraft and warcraft 3 where they managed to fir great multiplayer, many single player missions for all 3 races and a complete storyline onto a single 700mb cd but they can't do it with a dvd or two now also? I don't like the idea of paying 180 dollars to play all 3 races. Now since they merged with activision this tactic or more money is becoming more evident, I don't think it has anything to do with time or whatnot. Since merging with activision their prices have gone up, starcraft 2 cost 60 when they used to cost 50 like all of pc games, the starcraft 2 collector's edition now costs 100 when it used to be blizzard only charged 60 for the collector editions, the WOW:CATA collector's edition also got its price raised by like 30 bucks. The game was chopped up into 3 parts so they could sell more and nothing else.

4) Every other mission I felt like I was being rushed as much as possible in the single player campaign. It seems like every other mission has a timer of some sort. Save the colonists before the protoss kill them, destroy the trains before 5 get away, get out before the never ending wave of zerg kill you and so on. Way to often the game is rushing you through the map.

5) Even if you don't play online, you still have to connect to your online account to play. You have to get a battle.net account, you have to register your games cdkey and you have to be connected to your battle.net account before you can play a offline single player game. I don't like having to login so I can play a game offline.

6) There is no LAN support in the game meaning if I want to play with friends we are forced to go online and get funneled through the battle.net service. I don't like that, I liked being able to get on a LAN with my friends right there and play 100% lag free with no problems. But blizzard removed that feature purely so were forced to us their battle.net service in order to keep us on their servers. So the people I play with we tried it a couple times and didn't like it, so we fired up the original Starcraft instead and played on the lan and had more fun actually.

7) The multiplayer still sucks because of how the game is designed. Unless you practice and follow the exact same build order as found on online faq's like everyone else you'll get crushed online. The game is inherently flawed for online play to give victory to people who build stuff in a certain way. Play against a terran and watch them and they will all build the same things in the places in the same order. If you enjoy playing others but don't like following the exact same pattern every time you play and play to rush through as fast as possible then you won't have much success online or much fun either.

All in all blizzard has made Starcraft 2 vastly inferior to Starcraft 1 in every way possible. Aside from the fact the graphics are nice in part 2 there isn't a thing I liked as much as or better. I can't recommend this game unless it costs 15 bucks or less to you."

If you want a fighting game with comic book characters, your money is better spent on Spawn for Dreamcast. It's a similar game where you can throw objects and find weapons in the environment. But it's a LOT MORE FUN than this Nemesis game !"
169295,1,"Rockstar really shot themselves in the foot with this one. This game has 3 different kinds of DRM, none of which work very well. If you can get SUCK U ROM to verify that its actually a real DVD (which it doesnt always do) youve still got to contend with verifying 2 different codes with rockstars webpage AND sign up for rockstars steam-wannabe system AND sign up with microsoft live gaming whatever the heck that is.

Thats right, you have to sign up with TWO DIFFERENT ONLINE GAMING SYSTEMS to play this SINGLE PLAYER GAME.

After two days of messing with this, I never got further than the loading screen. This game is buggy as heck and it is impossible to tell if its crashing because of securom, rockstar-steam, MS live, or just poor coding in the game itself.

Rockstar used to make quality games that ran good and were fun to play. GTA4 shows that this is no longer the case.

Not only will i be returning GTA4... I will be avoiding rockstar games altogether after this DRM abortion. Its not even worth the discounted $20 price."

163350,1,Fantastic Game but this survival edition is a piece of Junk. All it came with was an alarm clock and its really crappy. Was totally not worth the extra money. Just but the collectors edition instead. i will never again purchase an amazon.com exclusive collectors edition again based on this purchase.
139172,1,"one major flaw ruins this entire game...

yes you guessed it, persistent internet connection is required. If you are not connected to Battle.net servers at all times the game WILL NOT function...period! so if you disconnect mid boss fight or right before you reach a checkpoint, yep you guessed it, all your progress will be lost and you will have to start from your previous checkpoint. No, there is no SAVE GAME function in Diablo 3, the servers auto save for you at each checkpoint only.

Personally, the game content itself could be phenominal and I really wouldn't care, the explicit decision to make a  ""single player game"" a INTERNET ONLY game is absolutely convolted idiocy. Unless Blizzard makes HUGE changes to this game I would be seriously surprised if this game continues to sell its copies.

To be clear, I did not by this game. I was one of the many who received a free copy for commiting to WOW for a year. Having said that, I would not buy this game nor recommend it to anyone. I would recommend it to someone I disliked to have sweet revenge but that is it."

1) The pins simply do not work. I no longer get a flashing screen, but one steady screen of the same color.
2) The pins are way too tight. I had to kinda force the game in, and had the most difficult time taking the carts back out.

If you're looking at this product page, chances are you're in a similar predicament that I was in. I would suggest either finding a different kind of pin connector set, have someone else do the work for you, or better yet, just replace the NES or get a clone console. This pin set will only cause frustrations and headaches."

186234,1,"What is it with Nintendo as of late? They seem to have turned into the new sega with all their addons and accessories just to play their already scaled down games.

So far just to play the handful of games I own for the Wii I had to buy the Wii mote, Nunchuck, Classic controller, Game Cube Controller, the Madcatz Arcade Stick (a must have for capcom fighters) and this Motion plus thing just to get my original wii mote to work better.

For the money I dropped into the Wii I could of purchased a system that offered more of the type of games I was interested in playing and not this overpriced partyware/fitness console.

Oh it might sound like I'm bashing the Wii but honestly I'm just dissapointed with the direction Nintendo has gone in as of late. I've always supported Nintendo and brought just about every console they released but I think this will be my last one for now.

The Wii motion plus is just an attachment that connects to the bottom of your wii mote. It comes with a rubber grip but no rubber grip for the nunchuck? Why is that? because Nintendo wants you to spend more money and buy the Nunchuck grip seperately or spend another 20 bucks as it only comes packaged with the grip for the standard wii mote. The wii mote plus is a lot more accurate. I thought it was a gimmick but it really does improve the responsiveness of the standard wii mote.

There you have it. Pay 20 bucks to correct Nintendo's flawed wii-mote design.

Well... what more can I say about the product? I didn't have to buy it, but I brought it because I wanted to improve the game play on the few wii games that I do own. Even still I'm bitter that I spent $20.00 on something that should of been more like 5 or 10 dollars. I'd rather put that towards purchasing a game than fixing Nintendo's problem. It's something that you honestly do need because it corrects an error with the current wii mote. Despite what they advertise it as this is really a fix for the controller.

1 star because this product shouldn't even exist. Nintendo's R&D team should have spent more time developing the wii mote to actually work properly."

256853,1,"I'm a sid meiers junkie and have played pretty much all of his games since Civ1 and was in love with all of them up to this game at which point I'm just now disappointed with what his studious put out.

The game play itself is really great and the graphics are awesome. It's too bad that after 30-50 turns the game becomes unplayable due to performance and you'll never get to actually finish a game that you start.

People will argue that Steam isn't DRM but that's exactly what it is. I have the game on CD with the expansion. I can't install them though because steam doesn't work right. The game won't install while Steam is offline, so why do I have a disc? I don't know. When I go online, steam won't connect because either their servers are down or windows firewall blocks something (although I doubt that since I turned it off, but that's what steam says). People who pirated the game are playing it right now, probably reading this post and laughing because their copies just work and they didn't pay $50 for the first DVD and $50 for the expansion like I did. Of course the joke is on everyone because the game runs slow even on higher end systems. I have a friend running a PC with 32GB of RAM and two NVIDIA 680's in SLI with a 256GB SSD and even on that beast of a machine the game crawls to a screaching halt of performance after about 40 turns. The farm graphics disappear completely from the screen so knowing what is built on a tile requires you to hit F10 to see what's actually there or to hover the mouse over each tile until you find something that you haven't built on.

Summary: Good game made bad by Steam DRM and poor coding.

What I would like to see Firaxis explain: How much did firaxis pay for this to win game of the year and did the people who gave the award get to actually play a complete game all the way through on a huge map with multiple city states and civ's? If so, what was their trick to actually getting the game to work the way that it should?"

334908,1,"From watching videos of this game on YouTube,I can tell that ""Shadow Of Mordor"" is absolutely beautiful on next generation consoles. The gameplay looks great and seems very smooth,the graphics are amazing,the nemesis system is interesting and the presentation is overall beautiful. Sadly,the same cannot be said for the last gen version of this game(at least the Xbox 360 version anyway). For starters,the graphics are DREADFUL! HONESTLY! I've seen better looking graphics on original Xbox games from 2003! The textures in this version of ""Mordor"" are downright UGLY! While the combat isn't all that bad,the game often time lags and there are occasional freeze-ups during gameplay and main mission cut scenes. One in particular froze up on me THREE times! I thought for sure,that I was going to have to return this game,but fortunately it finally started working. I couldn't continue on with this review,without also mentioning the annoying loading times. Every single time you exit the options menus,to tweak your options or to upgrade your items,the game loads for about 10 seconds. It's SO agravating! There are also occasional cut aways during certain cut scenes. Clearly ""Shadow Of Mordor"" was meant to be on next generation hardware,and this mess of a port REALLY shows it. The last generation version of ""Mordor"" was even delayed for two months,probably due to hardware restrictions and the programmers trying to FORCE this game on last gen consoles. Overall,this is a great game...just not on Xbox 360 and probably PS3 too. If you want to enjoy ""Shadow Of Mordor"" how it was MEANT TO BE,then buy it for Xbox One or Playstation 4."
46669,1,"I have bought this game on release day and so far I have not managed to connect to a single online server. Every time I attempt it disconnects me and I need to restart the game altogether.

We are working with the company that runs these servers in an attempt to increase this bandwidth, however we would expect demand to reduce following the peak that we expect this weekend, and so you should be able to connect more consistently after this time.""

It has been a week and nothing has changed. Buy this game only if your planning to play it single player. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
359132,1,"Paying to play with Bots, Hackers, and Idiots. If I had to sum up my WoT gameplay experience that would be it.

I played up to Tier 9 (10 total tiers). I spent a lot of time on this game before I gave up. Here is my final review of the game:

No matter what you like about this game they will change it in the next patch. Particular vehicles, classes, maps, whatever.

Don't even think about building up your arty. They nerf it over and over and over. If you were unfortunate enough to have rolled arty a few years ago then you pretty much lost all that progress as they took every single ounce of fun out of arty. What they do is change the game mechanics to your shot has a lesser chance of hitting, then they slow your reload and increase the time it takes to aim. You can literally do your homework while waiting for arty to reload.

Getting a good tank is a matter of luck. You might spend months playing a particular research line (as it takes that long) only to find out that there is a TERRIBLE tank in that line. One that will take months upon months of playing a tank you hate. You have three choices at this point 1) play another tank then pay (a lot: $20+) to convert your experience, 2) play through it. 3) Start another line from scratch. World of Tanks knows you'll eventually just get frustrated and pay your way through. WoT also uses patches to change the stats on vehicles. You might find a tank you really like but they change it so you will want to play something else. They absolutely do this on purpose. Why? To keep you moving up lines and buying gold to skip almost unplayable tanks.

The game is built to encourage people to buy gold. The model works for sure. But, if you aren't one of those people thats going to put money into every single round then don't expect to do very well. If you don't have a premium tank you don't make as much silver (money), don't get as good of match making (who you fight against) and your crew increases in experience slower. Pretty much, you can grind for months and get now where.

Micro-transactions are a huge part of this game. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you aren't will to pay and pay often. It isn't cheap. I have probably spent over $150 on this game so far. Now that I'm not spending more money on it the enjoyment level went WAY down.

Edit: for those of you who think you'll get to T10 then just play that, you're wrong. Those tanks lose money on average, so you're forced to play lower tiers (which only make a small amount of money), buy and exchange gold, or buy a premium tank."
470215,1,"I remember this game being way more fun on the computer. For some reason, the ds version was just a disaster. Horrid graphics, and gets boring very quickly. I'm kinda disappointed..."
76965,1,"Why it stinks?

1: there's only 8 missions per good or evil side, and no world map to choose where to go, you're trapped in the story.

2: The voiceovers are horrible compared to the old one, and just mimic the old ones, not very authentic at all, shameful.

3: The character pictures are done in cartoon, and substandard.

Why it's good.

1: There's trolls in it, we all love those, or love to hate them.

2: That's it, i've got nothing else. Someone shoot me for spending $60 on this sorry knockoff unworthy of even being qualified as an expansion."
229632,1,"I'm a gamer.  Sure - I've not spent half my life or more grinding out every single achievement on every single mindless game out there - but I've put in enough time on titles such as Oblivion, Skyrim, Eco Draconis etc. to feel that I know reasonably well what I'm talking about with respect to RPGs and game playability in general.

I bought Dark Souls because of the review on Gamespot.  There - I said it.  I mean - come on.  This thing is ranked fourth best XBox title OF.  ALL.  TIME.  It's up there with GTAIV and the original GoW.  How could I go wrong buying this?  Well - the other night I tore off the cellophane wrapper from this game and found out.

Most of the great reviews of this title praise it neverendingly for its realistic gameplay and unforgiving style.  Yes - on the back of the box it says ""Prepare to Die"".  This should actually have been rewritten to read ""Prepare to spend hours on this game and get nowhere - then die.""

First of all, you spend about an hour designing your character - only to find that you cannot click accept and start the game.  Why?  Well - after about 30 mins of Googling, I discovered that this was because I had not specified a NAME for my character.  Which was intended to go in one of the nondescript, unlabeled black boxes in the character creation screen.  Okay.  I guess that obscurity and sheer non-intuitiveness should have been my first warning.

Secondly - when you are finally thrust into the game, you are faced with a cheesy-sounding female voice actor who is SO overly dramatic and theatrical with her emphases etc. that she sounds like a reject from Lord of the Rings.  She walks you through what is - I GUESS - an apparent run-down of the world you are about to be thrust in to, talks about nymphs and bad guys and gods and omnipotent beings with weird names.  None of which means anything to you - because this is your first experience of the game.  I think the devs for this story really failed to appreciate that their curve was all off here.  How can I care about a story if I don't even understand what its main elements are/about?

Thirdly - THEN, you discover that that nice shiny character you spent an hour developing.....well, you can't use her.  Or him.  You are actually an undead type zombie thing, rotting in a prison until some faceless character breaks you out with a broken sword hilt.  Mmmmkay.  You then proceed to break out of the undead asylum by fighting zombies and skeletons, all the while trying to master the control and inventory system, which leads me to.......

FOURTHLY.  The controls and inventory system.  They're horrible.  Not only do they LOOK like the were designed for the NES - they ACT like they were designed for the NES.  You can't pause the game - so, tough luck.  IF you actually manage to find a quiet area to delve into your menus and inventory/equipment list, you will be faced with a dizzying array of items that you have picked up - with no clue as to what any of them do.  'Humanity'?  'Firebombs'?  'Souls'?  Do you actually know what any of those does?  No?  Why - you must have not sat down and spent hours reading every little load screen card that pops up in intricate detail.  Silly you!  You want to equip that new shield you just found?  Tough luck - because while you (the player) are sitting there squinting at the inventory lists trying to figure them out - guess what?  A horde of lying-in-wait skeletons have r@ped your character in the meantime.

Aaaaand fifthly.  Gameplay and combat.  Wasn't this supposed to be an RPG?  Because I have spent four days on this game, completed the 'tutorial' and made it to the first city.....or realm.....or place.......or whatever it is, and I still HAVE YET to find any true RPG-ing aspects to it.  What I saw was basically a hack-n-slash walkthrough without a plot that is insanely hard.  And talking about hacking and slashing - yeah, you can forget that.  If you are not interested in picking your way around corners like a field mouse looking out for enemies, and choosing your skirmishes with intelligent discerning - you can forget playing this game.  See those two skeleton derps in the distance?  Well - unless you want to die quickly, you'd better not fight them.  But wait - what's that?  You HAVE to fight them to proceed?  Well crap.....

The combat is really rudimentary and random.  Camera angles seem to actively HINDER you instead of help you - and there's a lot of generic, recorded ""muaaahhhh!""s or ""acckk!""s from the zombies when you kill them.  Animation doesn't fare any better.  I literally took on three skeletons at the same time last night, and while sitting there mashing the trigger to slash them, I saw each and every one of them animate in the same way, take the same hits in the same places, fall down and die in the same manner at the same time.  Is this the XBox 360 or the NES?

SIXTHLY.  That mashing I was talking about?  Get ready to do it.  A LOT.  Combat and fighting skills seem to account for nothing - each button on the controller seems to be linked to a random assortment of attacks with your sword that really seem to mean nothing.  You will hack and slash your way through every area, not caring what you hit so long as you're alive afterwards.  Except when you press a button once too many times, and it locks you into a five-second-delayed triple-strike animation that sends you flailing past that skeleton you were trying to hit because you didn't line it up exactly (*EXACTLY*) right, and powering on into another horde of enemies that will subsequently r@pe you.  And kill you.  Which, in turn, means that......

SEVENTHLY.  You die.  Dying seems to be an intrinsic mechanic in this game - but not in the fun sense.  They scoured any fun out of it by respawning ALL non-boss enemies when you die.  Not only that - but there is no way to save at a certain point.  NES come to mind?  The game utilized 'bonfires' as some sort of would-be 'calm-amongst-the-storm' moment of reflection - but all they are is checkpoints.  You die - you respawn at a bonfire.  All that grinding you did to get up to that bell?  Well forget it - you got killed.  You just wasted 45 minutes of your life because you didn't coax your enemies into a certain area which means you could face them one by one instead of all together......or you stepped off a cliff........or you got pelted by a firebomb while trying to walk along a bridge.

EIGHTHLY.  This is an RPG?  Holy cow.  I would have never guessed.  The story is convoluted and reads like some kind of druggie on meth put pen to paper, with random stuff thrown in that we are just supposed to accept just......well, because.  I have encountered a total of two NPCs - there's no dialogue with them or option to say things to them.  They just talk at you.  In their stupid, inflated, overly-dramaticized ways.  Remember the villains from your favorite kid's cartoon like Skeletor from He-Man or something?  Well - if you like that sort of voice acting you're in for a field day in Dark Souls.

There is no map, no world map, no sandbox feeling, no free roaming.  It's a hack-n-slash game with a trumped-up story that inflates it's own self-importance.  As an Oblivion/Skyrim/Bethesda fan - that's where I'm staying.  Screw this.

90582,1,"I purchased this game because, I had purchased the Ridge Racer Unbounded so I thought it was gonna be cool, not as good as the Unbounded but good enough. However, when I opened up the game and played it, I got disappointed. When you see the intro, the game looks amazing but, when you actually start playing, it is not entertaining at all. The game is so so so easy than even i if you try to crash, the cars refused to do it. No matter how hard you try, I will never crash. The graphics on the game are really bad.

I am 22, I am used to play games like forza motorsport, grand turismo, formula 1 and things like those. So you can see where i am coming from.

I recommend this games to children who just want to have fun and race. If you want to have a real racing experience, buy one of the games i mentioned before.

Also, I suggest not do buy like the previous series of games that you played thinking that they are good as well because you will find nothing but disappointment."
251947,1,"Overall, horrid sound quality make great design and a cool concept worthless. Although I can hear others crystal clear, friends say it sounds like I swallowed the mic instead of having it around my neck. One commented that it sounds like I'm being mauled by a bear. The only time it sounded crystal clear to them was when I was standing up to grab my wireless headset. Believe it or not, I don't feel like standing up every time I want to use this. It appears to boil down to either bad wiring or a bad connection. If you're still willing to try your luck and would like to know more about the design then read on.

One of the primary issues with the MW3 version of the same mic seemed to be the ""one size fits all"" that didn't fit all. This version is expandable. Each side has 4 settings for a total of 8 possible sizes. Each setting seems to expand it about an eighth of an inch for a total of (go math skills!) an inch of customization to play with.

A sturdy, adhesive backed, foam rubber strip is included to go along the inside of the back of the collar. Does this make much of a difference? I don't think so. If there were more weight to it and if it rested on your neck rather than wrapping around it, maybe it would.

The connection going into the controller is looser than it should be. I'm using it with the new GoW3 controller so it's not like it's an old controller that has worn from excessive use. It has fallen out without me noticing once. It also crackles here and there when moved. The wiring and connection design seem to be flawed.

Lastly, there is ample length to the wires, but wireless would have been much preferred. Unfortunately, Microsoft won't allow third party developers to create wireless peripherals. Without getting into my personal politics on this policy, I'll just say that you can't fault Madcatz for this shortcoming.

In the end, it looks like I'll be attempting to return this item for a refund."
205174,1,"I realize this game came out before the god of war series on the SNES i believe, but it seemed like a God of War wannabe. The camera movements were ridiculous and the story wasn't even good. I couldn't even beat it, it was that boring."
106294,1,"I have been a Sudoku fan for about 3 years now.  I do well at solving the ""difficult"" and ""fiendish"" puzzles in the New York Post Sudoku books (in my opinion are the best Sudoku books out there).  I thought I'd divert from these puzzles and try a shot at Platinum Sudoku after reading some of the reviews.

So far I've spent about 3-4 hours playing and have only solved 10 puzzles.  The puzzles are frustrating and challenging.  The ""Easy"" mode is not that easy, and I've barely scratched the surface on ""Medium"" mode. The numbers in ""draft"" mode (for guessing numbers)is so small that you have to get out your reading glasses to see what you've marked.  Also, the default font is incredibly hard to read and to get used to.  Unless you unlock some new fonts by completing several puzzles, there's really not a good font to select.  That alone makes the puzzles difficult to complete.  One of the things I have to agree with many other reviewers is the stupid girl and guy that supposedly pumps you up and makes you feel like you've accomplished something after completing a puzzle.  Give me a break!  It would have been nice to have the option to turn this feature off, similar to the music option.

The graphics are okay, but that's not what a good Sudoku puzzle is all about.

All in all, this game will be on my ""used games to sell"" list.  My friend has ""Ultimate Puzzle Games-Sudoku Edition"" and this beats out Platinum Sudoku by far.  I'm also sticking to the old school version of paper and pencil with a real eraser!!"

Cause capcom doesnt care about the blue bomber anymore
Sadly you don't get to pick your character & story
You have to play what the game gives you & i hate it
The gameplay is awefull
Cant explore due to limited amout of moves
Can finish off a bad guy without wasting a turn
Cant let a team die
This game sucks & its stupid"

403812,1,"This is for the delevery of the game and not the actual game.

I have a very poor internet connection - I got hosed by a girl at the cable company telling me our future home was able to get broadband - only to finish the build and move in and before anything was hooked up I called for broadband... nope we don't service that area (would have never bought the house had I known)

Anyway - I bought the disk copy of this game and i am not sure why... I guess all you are doing is buying the key code and you can use the disk as a coffee coaster.  You must install the entire game via download (for me 1 day and 18 hours)  Ugh.  So I guess it will add anticipation for this game.

258437,1,"I am 30 years old and I'm a huge fan of the Alien films, I was 16 or 17 when the first Alien vs Predator game came out and I loved it. I have always been a PC gamer and have stuck with it through the hardest of times both for me and for PC gaming itself. I enjoyed Borderlands 2, I thought it had some enjoyable coop but I quickly realized how the majority of fun came from the fact that I was playing with friends, not necessarily the game play.

This is not to say Borderlands 1 or 2 are bad games, they do what they set out to do well, and because of that I had faith that Gearbox would deliver at least a semi-decent product, but this game is one of the most shameful displays of a 2013 entertainment product that we will likely see all year. I actually went into this game expecting it to not be that great and I was still completely and utterly let down. I am also a pretty big Left 4 Dead fan and have 500 hours between both games clocked on my Steam account, Aliens Colonial Marines takes a few pages from L4D and shoves them into a lifeless, shell of a game.

There is not one single little detail that this game does better than anything else, and I say that with zero troll-ness in my heart, I say this because I really do not want people to waste their money like I did. I am a sucker. I fell for the marketing and the nostalgia brought on by my childhood. I should have realized that the embargo on reviews meant they knew it was bad, I should have listened to my gut when I first saw game play footage and the animations looked like something that came out before Doom 3. My friend and I are most of the way through the campaign right now and I had to quit because it was so mind-numbingly dull and repetitive. I will go back one last time to beat the campaign because I spent $50 on this ""game"", but I will never play it again after that, I will never pre-order another game and the chances of me buying another Gearbox title are pretty much slim to nil.

For reference my Game of The Year for 2012 was Far Cry 3."
474564,1,"This DS port of Syberia is just plain awful.  The DS version is actually from an earlier port of the cell phone version.  The thing that is wrong with this version is that this game is too watered down, and yes im aware that this a DS game and I shouldn't expect a full fledged PC adventure experience but seriously, this game is sad.  It has bad hit detection, which means you have to click on an object several times in order for the system to acknowledge what your clicking, the same song Loops throughout, no voice acting, graphics are junk which makes it hard to tell where to go and what is a obtainable item and overall its just a dull adventure.  I beg of you to pick up the PC or xbox version, which  are vastly superior in every way!!"

Two Worlds was something I had waited for.  Touted as The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion on steroids, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this; and as most things that get over hyped this one, too, fell on it's face and left a nasty mark.

Pros:  There are not many.  Character customization is simple. Game play is simple, press the button and bash something.  You can create your own weapons by combining two like weapons or adding an item, such a gem, to make the weapon stronger.  This also works with clothing (armor), and you can make your own spells by picking ingredients (if you can find them) in the wilderness.

You can not die, well you do, but instead of having to reload a prior save you are instantly ""resurrected"" at one of the many, many shrines you find along the road.

Cons: Story, if there is one somewhere, is your typical Fantasy fare.  You are the heir to a magic thingamabob, only you can use said magic thingamabob, bad guys want magic thingamabob, kidnapped your sister to force you to comply and go get / find magic thingamabob, blah-blah-blah, yawn.

The graphics are sub-par for what one has come to expect from the next-gen consoles.  You'd swear you were playing Gauntlet (arcade style graphics) or Baldur's Gate.  YIKES!  People look melted and backgrounds, although nicely done, tend to be muddy and mush into one big blob of grey-green space indiscernible from one area to another.

There is no tutorial, so to speak, and the on screen text will make you go blind, it is so bad you CAN NOT read it.  Legibility is the key to making a game fun for me!

The in game map is as close to useless as one can get, with no text or the same illegibility problem, navigating the rather large world takes some doing.

The voice acting is terrible!  I play with MUTE on!  I'm sure they tried very very hard and such a valiant  effort, but it is difficult to take all the ""Forsooth""-ing and ""Varlet""-ing when it is used in every sentence, it just kills the game.

A good intention gone horribly awry.  Don't waste you time unless you absolutely have to play another RPG or are a glutton or punishment."

428193,1,"I've come to the conclusion that there are no decent gaming headsets under $100. I add this to the list headsets that are a waste of money.

First, the cord on the headset cannot be plugged into the xBox360 (regular not Elite edition). Turtle Beach advertises that this works with xBox360 and Playstation but those are usually hooked to televisions, and many people own HD TVs now. We have an HD TV so we cannot use this with our TV for console video gaming ""as is"". (A Tritton headset we own comes with the cord able to be used immediately, not this Turtle Beach headset.) After researching this problem I found that non-elite editions of the xBox360 need an adapter cable that you must purchase separately. I shopped for that product and found two non-Microsoft items for sale on Amazon (under $10) but customer reviews stated for both that due to the design and size of the inputs on the non-elite xBox360 adaptations would have to be made using screwdrivers, a hammer, and for one of them, a soldering iron. I read that the Microsoft cable costs $50 but was unable to find it for sale on the Microsoft xBox360 website to confirm. I was hoping for a headset that just plugs in, period. I note that with the HD TV you need both the HDMI cable for the video and the other outlet for the audio, that's the issue. The price of the official Microsoft HDMI dongle is $50 full retail (that adds a lot of cost to the lower price of this Turtle Beach headset.)

Second, These begin to hurt the ears and head after one hour of use.

There is high sound quality which is nice but if they hurt or are not compatible with your TV what good are they? There are other nice sounding headsets on the market.

Our family decided we'd use it with the laptop when watching homeschool lectures, online driving school lessons, listening to music with the laptop while doing other work with the laptop and using for gaming while on the laptop. However after an hour, there is pain, so I can't recommend this headset.

I recommend that you buy a high quality headset and treat it with loving care, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRITTON-Pro-5-1-Surround-Headset-for-Xbox-360-and-PS3-Black/dp/B00B1MVNDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRITTON Pro+ 5.1 Surround Headset for Xbox 360 and PS3 - Black</a>. Just spend the money on a high quality item and don't waste your money buying multiple cheaper headsets that you will ditch in search of a decent one.

I rate this product 1 star = I Hate It.

Updated 5/30/13: after doing more research on the different xBox360 editions and the adapter dongle accessory."
432980,1,DooM! Click and collect!
64133,1,"Well, first of all, I have to give this game a VERY low rating, because it seems to ME, you have to use the money cheat JUST TO GET STARTED in the game. Otherwise, you will wind up not even having enough money to house the inmates.

Secondly, all this game consists of is pretty much waiting for the next parole period to come up so you can decide who stays, and who gets out (based on length of time inmate has been there, how many rehabilitation projects he's completed, how many fights he's been in, and what, if any, gang affiliations he has). There's really nothing you can do about the fighting that goes on in this game between inmates. I have yet to see a guard break up a fight. So to me this game is just long and boring.

The graphics, in my opinion, ARE kinda cute, but not $20 worth."
168159,1,"its a toybox for graphic designers to kill some time.

I could see this finding a spot in elementary/middle school classrooms....it borders on being fun but is really, absolutely not scientifically related to evolution beyond a child's understanding...and it has all of the gameplay of about 5 free flash games with tons of expensive graphic design.

NOT WORTH THE MONEY...get the free creature creator if you wanna stretch your artistic creativity."
100651,1,"If this game allowed you to use a USB mouse and keyboard, it would probably be quite fun.  As it is, the console control setup is terrible.  It is very hard to successfully move and select troops, and it is nearly impossible to group them.  I give this zero stars.  I bought it used for $10, and I still consider it to have been a waste of money."

301812,1,"How long did it take the studios to catch-up to COD4 PC users? Theyve had AI Bots and Castle maps for years! Sure the Stonehaven Castle map is a long needed breath of fresh air from freight yards, slums, and destroyed towns. But COD4 mp-burg is far superior with its battlements and tunnels. Youre not kidding anyone here studios, we know the creative talent has long left the building...

So I ask this of the Infinity Ward / Treyarch guys: Why not be brave and set the next game somewhere new? How about China ... The Great Wall, Leshan Park / Big Budda, Longman Grottos, Hong Kong, Shangri-la... Dont like that idea? Then how about Italy: Venice, Florence, Rome, Monselice, Italian Alps? Dont like any of those?

Got it day of release, shame on me for not reading the preview buzz. It seems the game is completely gimped and broken on the PC.

353246,1,Game is taylord to children. Game controls are simple and that's where the problem is. The combat system is all to simple no skill based assets what so ever. Just a really basic hack n slash. Its pretty much a grind fest on higher difficulties just need to triump the enemy by being a higher level. If you want a combat system that rewards you for skill then look somewhere else. At most you just press attack and the character attacks

Another annoying part of the pack is that there are two modes, one to turn the Rumble Pack on, and the other to work your gamepack to save games. Its just a hassle, and the only games that really use it are Zelda when you are fishing and sporting games, so you can feel the action."

458738,1,"5 worlds a world with about 6 minigames in each. That's about 30 or so
(some don't have bonus mini-games- and I'm not reloading my game to double check the exact number) minigames and over half of them being the same as the ones in the previous levels. And before you go to the last world, you have to complete the mini-games in the current, or all previous worlds (I can't remember) 3 times each. There are 4 main mini-games that repeat, and then 1 or 2 bonuses that very slightly or a lot from other bonuses. The main mini-games all have automatical scrolling, and you are either in a maze in a jet/tank that shoots, or in a jeep/robot that jumps/flips to avoid holes/enemies. This game is a side-scroller outside of the mini-games, and there are no levels other than mini-games. There is a half way point in each world where you do a special task of playing tug or grating ice. I admit that the sheep minigames were at least fun (who wouldn't enjoy using a jet to shoot sheep or toasting sheep while a timer is running). You can win cards, which is pointless, by playing spin the wheel, etc. You can't win all the cards unless you also have crash or a link."

138807,1,"I played Diablo 3 for around a week. I got all 5 classes past act 3; my best 2 characters (monk and witch doctor) got through normal difficulty.

=====  VISUAL  =====
The art style was cool to look at; it is one of the few 3d hash-and-slashes that I know of to go with a dark atmosphere, and the rocks in act 2 (desert, with black pointed rocks) were very stylish. I even got as far as to think that if the game keeps up the good artwork, it would be worthwhile to buy this game just to watch the artwork. But getting to act 3 (snow) and seeing the same rocks colored differently sunk all of my fantasies about the game's aesthetic value. The images are also a bit grainy; my guess is that the graininess is because Blizzard began designing the game around a decade ago, before we had today's screen resolution. The art style of acts 1 and 2 is about the only pro about the game.

=====  SERVER  =====
Given all of the connection issues (sometimes you can't connect), Error 3006 login issues (sometimes you connect, log in, and fall 1 step short of accessing your characters), and boss fight disconnects (sometimes you get disconnected during boss fights and reconnect as a corpse) already flooding the forums, I do not have much to say much about the server. (yes, Blizzard put me through all of them) The only things I have to add are:

1. While I was fighting solo to the final boss, I saw the message ""server will be down for maintenance in 15 minutes."" Just imagine that you fought so hard to finish the game, and failed because your SINGLE PLAYER server went down for maintenance!

2. I'm taking my time writing this review because Blizzard's server is down. Again.

=====  DIALOGUE  =====
You would think that, with all the time Blizzard invested into making Diablo 3, they will have plenty of time to polish the conversations. But instead, it seems that Blizzard ran out of audio/scripting funds from their long years of inactivity and had to cut the dialogue bank short. For most of the dialogues (including all of the quest dialogues), you have 1 set of NPC dialogues that fits all 5 classes, and each class works his/her dialogues around the NPCs'. The conversations are ok at times, but other times, it just feels like nobody's paying much attention to what the hero says. For example, take the following conversation between the Zoltun Kulle (a ghost) and your character:

If you play monk, you get:
Kulle: The Horadrim did all this to lock my body away. They must have been very angry with me.
Monk: They couldn't kill you. What else can they do?
Kulle: They were never very creative. (me: yeah, that sort of makes sense to me. So they aren't very creative about how to get rid of Kulle.)

And if you play witch doctor, you get:
Kulle: The Horadrim did all this to lock my body away. They must have been very angry with me.
Witch doctor: Are you surprised? Few people take betrayal lightly.
Kulle: They were never very creative. (me: huh?? what does taking betrayal harshly have to do with creativity? Kulle, ignoring me is not cool!)

=====  GAMEPLAY  =====
This is actually the biggest issue I have about the game. Diablo 3's enemy attacks for normal is divided into 2 categories: scratches... err...no, gentle touches, and nukes. And around 90% of the latter take the form of an unmoving circle that explodes after 1-2 seconds.

So gameplay (at least for normal) basically goes like this: you run around, squashing everything in your path, and getting blown into pieces because a few enemies cast circles under your feet. This is especially frustrating in acts 3 and 4, when even a type of normal minion can throw these attacks. It feels like the monster designers ran out of ideas and decided to throw bright circles in every act, hoping to get away with ""we're testing our players' reflex!""

=====  IS IT WORTH IT?  =====
Overall, I'm glad I got this game for $35. Is it worth it? No. It's worth $10 at best. But it's better than the pre-order price of $60. And it's one of those games which has such an epic predecessor that I simply had to try it despite its accumulative 2-stars. But after Diablo 3 leeched Diablo 2 of its fan base, I will be a lot less tempted to buy Diablo 4 should Blizzard decide to make it.
For those who wonder why I still put up with this, it's because I already invested $35 into it. And because I want to see if anything changes during late game (though I seriously doubt things will change)."

Anyway,that aside..this game is an absolute and total nightmare!! Even Hideo Kojima himself,was ashamed of this monstrosity. This version was NOT how Kojima originally intended the game to be!! The gameplay is absolutley awful and the punishing difficulty,shows NO MERCY on you!! The graphics,music and sound effects are promising,but the horrid gameplay,the extreme hardness and the crappy controls,completely put those to none effect whatsoever. Overall,if you wanna enjoy the original ""Metal Gear"",how it was meant to be..then I recommend picking up ""Metal Gear Solid 3:Substance"" for PS2 instead,which includes the REAL original ""Metal Gear"",and not this lackluster insult to such a great iconic video game!!"

I'm a professional IT guy and a gamer to boot and it took me 2 hours to get it installed and another 2-3 days trying to get it to launch before I gave up.

Stupid.  THAT'S NOT EVEN BILL COWER ON THE COVER!  It's a cheap imposter...that right there should tell you something...

Just another attempt by EA Games to squeeze a few more dollars out of the saps who are crazy about football.  I borrowed this game from a friend over the summer, waiting for NCAA 07 to come out, AND I'M SO GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT!

It's alot of reading, alot of negotiating, and a whole lot of nothing else.  If you like calling plays, but not actually running them yourself, you might like this.  If you like to spend the whole evening trying to pry T.O. away from another team to be you starting wide out, you might like this.

You tell the 8 soldiers you control to shoot the bad guys but they cant even aim good and they don't shoot unless you tell them to. Even if they are going to die they don't shoot. You cant even walk around you tell the soldiers where to go. Also on the box it says its based on a army training thing. I thought it would be a action packed shooter because thats what it looked like on the box, but I was wrong. There is no action at all, you just move around while you see a couple bad guys who just wound half your guys. I rented this game from Blockbuster, went home and put it in my PS2, played it for 25 minutes then brought it back to Blockbuster. If all US army soldiers trained on something like this the US army would be the worst army in the world."

For all you fools out there singing praises to this new falcon chip .......Its too early to tell if it will hold up over time considering its only been out for a few months.

It really is a knockoff of Minecraft and a major disappointment for those that are used to the Harvest Moon series.

Not like the original Fallouts where it would tell you what effect your actions would have on the wasteland. The main story is a little tacky and short. You can skip most of it and jump to the middle of the story line which makes it evem shorter. Bottom line, save your money for a game that has not been molested."
162131,1,"I'm not even gonna waste my time writing a review for this piece of zhit of a game. It's a completely revamped game copying ""some"" of the elements of diablo 2 and alter it to make the game ""innovative"". Well innovative my ass, the only innovation blizzard did was masterfully lure players to pay 60$ with their humongous chain of ads, and included that idiotic RMAH to get more money. Thank God that RMAH actually ruined the game so I don't have to vitch and vitch since the game will slowly die by itself.

End-game is non existent, except you want to sit all day developing some cool ways to invent a new macro that will allow you to grind repetitively by using one button (and its bannable too apparently). Ironic isn't it, they designed the game to be repetitive, yet when we make our lives easier they have every right to pull the plug.

Blizzard will never be the same company they used to be during the diablo 2 days. They're here, they're big, they're cool and their goal is to rip you off selling zhit that you won't touch for the rest of your life. Read the comments with 1-3 star, trust me I didn't believe the game was such a failure either until I tried it myself.

Played diablo 2 for 7 years and quit for dota. Played diablo 3 for 2 months, quit after realizing wtf have these morons developed for 6 years??"

DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY FOLKS! just spend the 22 or so dollars it is for the real sony battery, at least you won't feel ripped off and violated!"

The game suffers from frame rate drops under 30 fps on the PS4 Pro sometimes, its probably way worse on the original PS4. The controls are super laggy, floaty, janky and unresponsive, it is unacceptable for a game to have such poor controls in 2016. I regret buying this game for full price on PSN but if I can help someone save their money, that's still better than nothing. Shame on Sony for releasing this game in its current state. Avoid."

If you are in the military I strongly suggest that you do NOT buy this game. Blizzard refuses to add in support for LAN which is what most military members use in deployed locations to play these types of games.

229361,1,"I realized it was going to be a ""movie"" based game, so it wouldn't be up to par to it's stand alone counterparts, but the garbage this game has delivered.. wowed me.

- Single player is not exactly short, but not long either.. For the low quality of the game, I found it to be too long, but just because I wanted to be done and over with this game..
- Graphics quality.. oy, where do I start... there isn't any quality. in some areas textures are overlapping each other, the boundaries of textures are often expanding over the visual border (so you cannot shoot ouf of the corner, or walk close to it, or toss a grenade.. you WILL get stuck)
- Multiplayer could be fun if the graphics and programming was done right, and they figured out how to prevent lag..

All in all, this game would be ok, if it was priced at 10-15$, but if you want to spend money on a good game, this one isn't what you are looking for."
378549,1,"I want to love this system, but after two weeks with hours of time with support this system is highly flawed against families.  My kids still can't play games (even on games rated E for everyone it is giving a content lock).  Adding accounts is filled with error codes (haven't been able to add any, only download).  The guide for adding family doesn't work because the first thing it tells you to do has an error (in the system location).  For everything this console is supposed to be, it shouldn't have made the account process worse (360 didn't have this many hoops).  My kids just want to play their Christmas presents and instead of relaxing on Christmas I am still stuck with this nightmare (they have only been able to play as guest).

I also dislike that the controllers are much harder to tell who is which player which helps a lot when you prefer to play 4 player games."
182483,1,I ordered two of these and neither one would charge either our Nintendo DSi or Nintendo DSi XL.

203676,1,"Way to be loyal to your fanbase that has supported you all these years capcom. This is no different than what sony did with the psp go, except this is physical media instead of dlc. Now, everyone's saying that capcom did this to destroy the used game market and in essence they have with this title in particular. However, I don't foresee them doing this with future releases because this game is different. Mercenaries is simply minigames that have no story and consist of individual levels which should still be available even after you beat the game. What I'm saying is that, they did this because they knew people were going to buy this game and play through it a couple of times in one day and then sell it, which in turn would not leave much room for the market of new games. I'm definitely not siding with capcom on this, because it is their fault to begin with for making a game that consist of only minigames that should've been included on the upcoming revelations game. I didn't purchase this title, but was going to buy it used in a few weeks, however, I'm never buying this and will probably never buy another capcom title again. It's shameful business tactics like this that eventually lead to the demise of good companies. Greed is for now, but disloyalty is forever!"

I own every smash game except for the 3DS version.

I'm not impressed with this game, it's too similar to Brawl, and I'll be damned to buy an adapter to use a controller that's 3 generations old!

Why didn't they include story mode????
Nintendo made a huge mistake by not including it, the cinematics are lacking and gameplay is very similar to brawl.

All that aside, if this is the only system you own, then get the game, but I highly suggest purchasing Brawl first.  This game isn't worth the $59.99 price tag.

If you're like me and own multiple systems, do yourself favor and purchase PlayStation All Stars, the game is made extremely well, very good level design, nice selection of characters, great graphics, awesome sound, and easy pick up and play gameplay.

I already sold this game and will pick up this new iteration when it goes on sale.

Personally I don't like the snide attitude of the creator of this game, people save your money, the sleeper hit that's going to be Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, retailing for only $39.99"

199114,1,Supreme Commander 2 is a crappy game. Nice graphics. Nice path finding. But the story is silly and intrudes on the game. The game play has very little in common with the previous Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation games. They took Command and Conquer's game play and story mode and slapped Supreme Commander's graphics on top. I don't recommend this game unless you really really really enjoyed C&C Tiberian Wars.

345299,1,"This game is ridiculously clunky and s***ty. It looked rather cool, videos and pics really drew me in. Cinematic are garbage, usually a aperture of a game that a creator tries too hard on and u wish they tried more on thr story. However it all just sucks. A cinematic cuts out beofre it seems like it should leaving question and uncertainty and to what is happening in this story that you already know nothing about. I've spent hours aimlessly wandering around looking for the first person who is supposedly going to die if I don't find him..im pretty sure he's freaking dead. There's no direction. As to where you need to go. Just ""find this guy"". Which makes me wonder if I'm even going the right way or if the games just letting me wander around stupidly.
game play isn't horrible, it can respond how it should, but I haven't seen my enemies be a staggred much at all even though the game claims I could. Making a character class seems pointless as the character can be adjusted to fit whatever play style you want. Sooo it's a useless setup.
to add to the frustration of the game just overall sucking. The voice is completely off in every scene my character attempts to speak. Basically he screams in pain, and a few seconds later thr act that caused pain happens, or the other way around and it has happened and then he's screaming about being hit.. don't give this company your money the games trash and they should've released updates to have at least fkn solidified the game to be enjoyable to play.

115828,1,"The third Adventure Company game based on an Agatha Christie novel, Evil Under the Sun is disappointing evidence that this series - never great to begin with - is actually getting worse over time.

Puzzles are few and far between, and nearly all of them are simple inventory puzzles. As with the previous games, you just pick up anything the game will allow you to take, and tote it around, ridiculously, until you eventually have need of it. In a couple of cases the game even gives you detailed instructions for how to solve a puzzle. If you think that following instructions (complete with diagrams) is a lot of fun, well, this is the game for you.

Otherwise, you can just sit back and watch Poirot walk around. There is no way to fast-travel between locations, so much of your time will be spent walking. Hopefully you'll find that very entertaining, because the pace of this game is astonishingly slow. The game is composed of eight chapters, and the murder doesn't even occur until chapter five. Until then, most of the ""action"" comes from two new storylines created for the game: a Fifth Columnist hunt (the game takes place during WWII), and a plot about a glowing green ghost that even Scooby Doo would find silly. And don't even think about skipping any dialogue - if you don't painstakingly work your way through the dialogue tree, you're likely to get stuck.

But far and away, my biggest gripe with this game is the ""new ending."" Do not be fooled by this - the murderer is the same as in the novel!  Apparently the ""new"" part comes from the, um, action scene that follows (in cut scene, of course, because heaven forbid the player have to do anything during the climax of the game). The new ending doesn't even make much sense, really, but I was so happy to see the game end that I won't nitpick.

Bottom line: this game is a joyless, plodding exercise that never would have been made if not for the Christie name. Read the book instead. If you're looking for a good detective game, check out the Nancy Drew series. Honestly, you could just watch paint dry and it would still be more fun than this game."
359213,1,"I got this game from gamestop and woaa big disappointment, poor development like the one that came, out few years ago. I can't believe i fall for this again."
192831,1,"This game is an example of everything that has ruined games for me since the early 90's. No pause, no manual save, no map, and even though it's classified as an rpg the character doesn't level up by defeating enemies, nor can they sell items they collect, neither can they gather information on where to go and what to do by speaking to other characters. Strangely, this is not what ruined the game for me. It was the arbitrary soul tendency system, which IS the most cryptic pile of nonsense I have ever run across in a game. I got to hand it to the people who marketed Demon's Souls, they decide to call it an old school hardcore gaming experience, and critics and gamers buy it. That's the reason I bought it. But those old games were hard because of a lack of game testing or technological limitations. This game was probably not tested very much, or at all. It would go a long way in explaining the shizbomb story, and lack of character development. If they can make a game this lazily, call it old school or hardcore, and have the critics and gamers eat it up, I'm going to find it very difficult to trust reviews by others. I would also like to add that I destroyed the game disc, then threw it in the trash. It's home now. I should also add that I beat this sucker. I've beaten many games of this sort, and I always feel the same, that the experience is akin to having teeth pulled sans novocaine. Yeah, it makes you hardcore, but afterwards you won't be smiling much, and you just might deck the doc!"

The controller does hold up for light games but breaks down in games that require some pin point stress. Y button broke down fast, A button got stuck, R button became unresponsive. I got it for 10 dollars and it wasn't even worth that, it lasted less than a week. As other reviewers said, it's cheap plastic. As for even opening the product, I didn't bother, but the original gamecube remotes require a tri-head screwdriver, same one that is needed to open a DS. It's something that has to be specially ordered to fix or modify their products.

You might as well wait until an actual MMORPG comes out instead of a mess like this.

188618,1,"Two Worlds 2  or (TW2)has some improvements over the first one, but the improvements all have their pitfall which makes the game feel like rubbish.

Although the graphics have been revamped the environments and everything in the game world looks blurry and out of focus regardless of the HD or regular tv you may have. The draw-in distance is not very good either with lots of pop-ins and graphical glitches like a characters leg showing through solid objects (clipping).

There are also sound glitches which cut off an on abruptly at times. The music which is rather good, is very short and loops back endlessly, except that it doesn't have any musical transitions if it restarts again.

Voice acting is certainly better for the most part, but the character you control sounds like a sleezy porn star with a raspy voice.

The controls and in responsiveness of the character on screen is sluggish, you mash buttons wildly and see your character swinging the weapons in a limp fashion. Which brings be to the combat gameplay.

One button can be used to block attacks but it feels sluggish and unresponsive at times. You can dual wield weapons but the techniques look goofy and ineffective. You cannot lock-on to enemies during melee combat so a lot of times when you thought you had a solid hit, you actually end up slashing nothing.

The character animations still look sloppy, and they still move a bit stiff. The animations in Two World 2 lack the fluidity or any life-like movements found in many other open world RPGs.

Probably the only thing I really enjoyed in Two Worlds 2, is the crafting system which allowed me to create or repair weapons and clothing and magic spells. Also Liked how it allowed me to ""dismantle"" items and break them down into core elements such as metals, fabrics or potions.

The story was lackluster and tries to rip off the better Fable games. In TW2 main quest you have to rescue your sister from the evil Gandahar (incorrect spelling sorry). After the the boring and sloppy combat, blurry graphics and long list of glitches, I didn't care for TW2. The fanboys can attack me all they want but It won't change the facts that this tries to be a good RPG but fails on many fronts.

The first game sucked bad and I had high hopes that the improvements to this sequel would make me enjoy the game.
But this the second attempt which SouthPeak, and the developers fail to bring a good title. TW2 should be the final nail to coffin and hopefully this game gets buried or sold in the bargain bin.

Pros:
+multi-player game modes
+crafting system is easy and fun to use
+open world gameplay

Cons:

-glitches galore
-music and sound cuts off
-some of the voice-overs still suck
-blurry graphics
-sloppy controls
-sluggish response
-goofy animations
-goofy looking combat
-no lock on system
-navigation on maps an compass is not easy
-interface takes a while to get used to
-lacks intensity in action

422058,1,"Well kids, I just returned the Xbox One my wife bought me after only a week of ownership. With the One being my first gaming console since the original Xbox I was in for a big shock.

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

I don't know if it's me not catching up with the times but it seems like games and consoles have gotten way over priced and you can share games like we used to. On top of that we have to now pay a membership fee to even use the games we ALREADY BOUGHT. This all seems like one big marketing ploy to me. I'm not standing for it so back to the store the Xbox went"
253944,1,"No physical damage. my son was very careful with it and the mic just quit. I realized they had a two year warranty. I contacted them and they agreed to exchange them, at my cost. It cost me $9.32 to return them. Plus the $7.43 for a 3 year warranty that lasted 3 months and won't carry over to the replacement ones. That is a pretty big chunck on a cheaper set of headphones. I am done with Turtle Beach products."
280304,1,"I recently purchased this console for my nephew and it's already collecting dust in the shadow of his Xbox 360.  This product feels rushed to market with so many cut corners that basic amenities modern gamers have become accustomed to are nowhere to be seen.

The OS is slow, poorly laid out and filled with all sorts of hurdles and 15-20 second loading screens every time you want to explore ANYTHING with it.

After enduring the painfully slow day 1 mega-patch on Nintendo's anemic servers and installing all sorts of additional patches to make the system work as advertised, I found it to be highly underwhelming.

Hulu+ causes the system to periodically lock-up completely (requiring a hard reset - unplugging it and then plugging it back in), the F-Zero mini-game that came bundled with the Nintendoland title constantly causes the system to prompt the user with a controller re-configuration while pausing the game (I believe this is due to the user's hands covering up the IR emitter on the top of the controller - something difficult to NOT cover up when instructed to hold the controller sideways) and the other titles just don't really feel like anything more than old Wii games with an up-scaled resolution.  Compatibility is still an issue as well.  The ""Pro Controller"" (the Xbox 360 controller-like peripheral for the Wii-U) isn't even supported by games like New Super Mario Bros. U!  The shared sound between the Wii U controller and the TV is disorientating and annoying (not to mention, it nullifies any advanced sound system many home theatres use).

This console doesn't offer anything that hasn't already been available for many years (with time to be refined and improved -- something Nintendo has failed to do with any of their software/hardware).

As someone that has been a Nintendo fan since the original Famicom/NES, it pains me to give such a harsh criticism to the company that helped dig the video games industry out of a New Mexican landfill.  Nintendo is banking on the nostalgia factor and, sadly, the gamers in this household don't live in the past (where this console belongs).  Save your money and either hold off for the truly ""Next Gen"" hardware rolling out next year or wait for something worth purchasing from Nintendo's game catalogue."
149934,1,"The key bad points in this game are:
1:Way too much grinding and farming
2:semi decent graphics just slightly better than ps2
3:boring music but just below average
4:It has some nice armor and weapons textures but not much differences between them expect new armor and weapons may look worst than what your wearing and it takes too long to make them in the item creation, to make all of them could take over a year of boring grind/farming. Possibly over 900-3000 hours of gameplay is a big turn off for me.

If you go online to the game servers its a scam, the amount of time consumed when playing online is ridiculous the farming is hard the amount of rewards are rare and if you go on DLC psn network you know why, all the DLC combined is over 100 $150+ buy this and that such as increased drop rates, and have it lasts for 30 days only, a lot of the best gaming is supposed to be done online but at a high price, the game is a 2/5 at best such a game should not be so hard to play online with all that grinding, You've been warned its a serious grind game just as bad as world of warcraft, I'm a hardcore gamer but this game White knight chronicles is only just okay offline. The moment i went online i was scammed out of so many hours spent and only little reward to be had. A lot of people reviewing this come from the game company themselves. Trust a real person a real gamers review, I will say this offline it has some fun to be had with it, go through a half decent storyline your main character remains silent and boring throughout the story which doesn't make sense, its very anti-climactic for all those hours u could spend creating your character is only useful online.

So when you do go online your whole world changes you have to grind and farm even more than a typical hardcore gamer is used to, I gave up playing this online as the game isn't good enough to promote such grinding and rare drop farming. Just to make your gear/outfit/armor that overall has better stats than what your wearing but lacks in style and appearance, such as I'm wearing a cool armor and weapon but I make or find something that has way better stats than what you already have on, just kills the whole point in spending hours farming and grinding to make the new piece or armor and weapon look really shabby and crap all that time spent to look more ruined in the game???

A lot of people stopped playing this game so the community online is dying, I'm sure this is because of the lack of game mechanics to keep you playing, this is what happens when you force people to spend more than 300 hours doing nothing but rare item hunting which does nothing but waste your time. Imagine this going out looking for groups to do a quest for rare monster drops, you spend some time getting a group then you all go out together when you go through the level and kill the end boss say spending 1-2 hours or more in it and the boss doesn't drop the necessary material thats needed to make a piece of armor or weapon? You catch my point in games like this thats not an MMORPG massively multi-player online rpg all boss drops should be once defeated a 100% drop rate so people can work on other pieces of gear instead of farming the same one over n over. A note to the developers this game isn't an MMORPG so don't try to emulate the grinding and farming on doing the same repetitive quests over n over.

The game is full of materials and a lot of them cost a lot of time and money to get, and the game isn't rewarding when you kill enemies you do not end up with much money at the end and mats you have to grind for a long time to get quantity of them just enough to build the next armor/weapon. The music in the game is just below average, the storyline super cliche, The graphics are just slightly better than Playstation 2 quality, the only thing thats decent is the texture of the armor and weapons, but most of them are too similar in design and only have different designs on them so really I'm going to farm 400 hours just to get another piece of armor thats worst looking has better stats than my good looking armor and weapons and with slightly different characteristics? No thank you. I completed the game and the sequel because I'm one of those hardcore gamers even though I don't like a game if i find something of small interest in it I will continue to play it till i finish it, but that damn online mode that kills out your psn wallet for little reward isn't worth it or the time spent in building the rest of your gameplay. The problem is you have to go online to get the chance to make all your weapons and armor as some quests you need help from other people to complete. Having to spend months to a year or so on one game... that to me is just super lame.

If you want a decent RPG that will last you a decent time without the process of involving a 400-500+ hours of pointless grinding/farming avoid this game at all cost trust me you will thank me.

I miss the days of Grandia, Final fantasy 6-7-8-X, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, Secret of mana, Star ocean 2, Valkyrie Profile, Zelda 1, 3 and Ocarina of time just to name a few top ones there. So you guys know I'm for real a hardcore rpg fan since the release of Zelda 1 NES and even further back Heavy on the magic keyboard adventure game on the Amstrad."

162401,1,"I am a huge Diablo fan. I love the first two games and expansion and have waited years for #3. I wish I had never bought it. Where I am located the game is unplayable. And, in this case, location does have an impact on whether or not you will be able to play Diablo. I think Blizzard underestimated the sheer volume of fans they have that live in an area where extremely fast, stable and unlimited internet is unavailable.

I have internet through mobile broadband and while it is OK for surfing it is not fast enough to play online games. I knew this before I bought the game but hoped that Diablo 3 would just use a connection to validate your character and then play as a normal game off your hard drive etc. but this was not the case. Even when playing single player the online aspect of the game is so entwined into the game itself that I was unable to play with my current internet setup.

Another problem is the lack of support for some common video cards. I understand a new game will not run on all systems and that even after a few years your PC maybe be falling slightly behind unless you upgrade but I have an Alienware for Christ's sake. It maybe be one of the cheaper models (M11X) but until Diablo 3 I had not tried to play a single game that my system would not run, this includes recent titles like Dead Island which I played with maxed out graphics for hours with no frame rate issues at all. Even when I took my PC to a location that had fast internet I was still unable to play at any more than 4-5 frames a second (with graphics and resolution all the way down) and my system is overclocked.

My video card was not only in the not recommended list but the completely unsupported list. I guess I should have researched that before hand but I never dreamed my computer would not run a game like this. I had to add a (-launch) command to the exe and change a few numbers in the instillation file to even get past the games graphic card filter to attempt to play it (there is a guide online for this). I bought my copy from Walmart which means I can not return it. It makes me mad that Blizzard would block some users from even trying to play the game they purchased especially for those of us who can not return it.

I activated a new internet service with a slightly better ping which was the best I could do in my area but was unable to log on for most of the entire day due to the servers being overloaded. Even after the launch day storm is over, and even if I could play the game, I would not appreciate having to rely on servers to play a game that I purchased.

I always loved the first two games because I could play them offline but forcing players to have an internet connection is a bad choice and I think Blizzard will lose many fans over it. The best I can do now is wait a few years until I have the money and actually need a new system since I can't upgrade the graphics card in my model and hope someone hacks it and releases a patch of sorts to allow offline play. Funny, if you think about it, the choice to force players to connect to the internet in hopes of preventing people from altering the game in anyway may promote people to do just that."

277405,1,"I read the reviews that said it wasn't a good PC port. I read the reviews that said you'd have to play with a USB console controller. I even read the reviews about it being a ""game for windows live...beware!"" But...for $8, I couldn't resist trying it for myself. Well, I've tried to play it for a few hours on multiple occassions. You can play without logging in to windows live, but you cannot save, so there isn't much point in a game of this caliber. I cannot seem to play with only the keyboard/mouse OR only the USB controller. There still seems to be some things that I still have to use the mouse or the controller for, but I cannot seem to find the way to play exclusively one or the other. I'm sure this could be changed in the key bindings, but if the default game, as loaded from start up cannot be played without a higher level knowledge of such things, I am not a hardcore enough player to do be bothered with that."

458801,1,"By this point, most gamers have tried the original ""Donkey Kong"".  While not quite as iconic as Pac-Man, ""Donkey Kong"" was effectively what put Nintendo on the map in the gaming industry, and the debut of a certain ""Jump Man"", who would later be renamed Mario.  You may have heard of him.  He went on to have a pretty successful career after this game.

So what is ""Donkey Kong""?  A giant ape who kidnaps Pauline (not Princess Peach), who Mario . . . er, Jump Man must rescue.  Donkey Kong throws barrels at Jump Man. Jump Man must avoid the barrels, jump over other obstacles, climb ladders, etc, to get to the top of the screen and save the princess from the throes of Bowser . . . er . . . Donkey Kong!

What is notable about this game and other early pre-Famicom/NES titles was Nintendo was actually a third party.  Once upon a time, in the early 1980s they licensed their IPs to other platforms at the very start of their foray into video games. Given the troubled fortunes of the Wii U during its initial launch cycle, and Nintendo President Saturo Iwata's adamant refusal to license out its IPs to tablet/smart phone devices, playing Mario and Donkey Kong on anything other than Nintendo hardware just seems bizarre, and that's because no one has played their Ips on non-Nintendo hardware (at least, legally), in decades.

One of my first experiences with Nintendo games was playing Donkey Kong and Mario Bros on the Atari 2600. In 1983 Nintendo and Atari were trying to broker a deal and when that fell thru they brought out the Famicom that year and the Pal/US equivalent (NES) in 1985. Before that though they did publish their games on the Atari and some other hardware.

The Gameboy Advance title in the Classic NES series is, appropriately enough, the NES version of Donkey Kong.  The problem with the NES port is that it's only three levels, and is missing the fourth level that was exclusive to the arcade (which is the pie level).

By now, years after its release and the Gameboy Advance long superceded by Nintendo's subsequent handhelds, there is very little appeal in picking up this edition of ""Donkey Kong"".  First, it's only three levels long and can literally be beaten in ten to twenty minutes, with the only appeal being to go for high scores (which was appropriate to the market in the early 1980s . . . but even by the late 1980s, people just didn't care about high scores).

Overall, the Classic NES series was fairly disappointing.  With few exeptions (such as ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"", and ""Super Mario Bros.""), Nintendo released (in America, anyway), mostly very short gameplay experiences.  The Japanese ""Famicom Mini"" series had a much stronger lineup than the games we got in the West.

In terms of Donkey Kong, I would pick it up on the Virtual Console if you really want to play it.  Do not waste your money on the Gameboy Advance version."

146264,1,"This game has a great story.  This game is compelling and interesting, and this game is one of the most irritating games I've ever played.  Any game that relies on reflex button press sequences is just cookie cutter weak and stupid.  WB middle management people who thought this would be a good idea should be summarily fired asap.  Each fight is an irritating button press sequence.  Too many stupid combos sends this game's play back to street fighter in the 90's.  We've come a long way since then, but apparently not this game.  This game has zero replay value. If you paid more than $5.00 for this game you wasted your money.  I haven't even mentioned the complete lack of sound track music.  For a game about sound, this game has the bar none WORST sound of any game I've ever played.  I suppose it is supposed to be evil and disturbing, but I hate to inform the game developers, static and poor recording hiss is NOT evil and disturbing, its irritating and stupid.

It has been a long time since I've actually become angry at how bad a game is.  This game shoots to the top of my list of most horrible games.  I think the worst thing about it is the arbitrarily stupid limitations on what you can do.  Like for example; at one point you are fighting a boss that's hurting you with an area of effect weapon, and you walked up some steps to get close enough to the AOE.  When the boss actually attacks, there is nothing apparent stopping you from just backing down the steps and reassessing the situation, but no, that would actually make sense so you can't do it.  Later after the boss is defeated you jump down out of the area in a cut scene, something you couldn't do before that.  This kind of physics neglect is one of the worst offenses of the ""Cut scene"" programmer games like this one.  The whole game is just a linear series of scenes and fights strung together with reflex button press sequences.  It completely offends me.  I'm guessing this type of game has become popular as movie people try and get into the game business.  They desire to have the player play through a movie they've written, and so the forced scripting of your actions drives you through it.  This has got to be the worst playing experience I've ever had.  People who make games like this, take a look at half life, portal, half life 2 etc.  These sublime games deliver the awesome story without forced action.

This game is the new Worst Game EVER!"

The first level starts off with a few simple tasks. Or so they seem. You complete the first task, ""hey, no problem, I've got this nailed"", then, almost immediatly, the director shouts out another task you have to do usaully within 5-10 seconds. Despite how terribly hard, annoying, and frustrating it is, I just have to wonder how the makers thought this would be fun? I mean, completing task after task after task. Now, in games like Grand Theft Auto, the whole task thing's fun. You can actully get out the car and do other things, but not in this game! You are strictly stuck onto one direct path for each level, and there is no time for rest.

37270,1,"Pac-Man has been having a really good run on the Nintendo Gamecube, really. With titles like the excellent 3D platforming adventure Pac-Man World 2 and the fun multiplayer experience that is Pac-Man Vs. under the dot-muncher's sleeves, not to mention a Namco Museum containing Arrangement games.

So why the heck did Namco allow this to be placed onto store shelves? Trust me when I say that the opening FMV video to the game was the best thing about it. Once you get that out of the way, you're thrown into a swarm of low-budget-ness, complete with Comic Sans font seen in menus and other bland screens. This includes the game itself, which is just a board game video game as a way to hop aboard the Mario Party train. Only problem: This is way worse than every Mario Party there is.

The game lets you pick one of THREE boards. Yes. Only three. Even worse, they are boards that you just race from start to finish on. I thought it'd be alright though, since a brief game could still be fun. However, they managed to make these boards DRAG. I could have sworn I was supposed to finish up my game like an hour or so prior. Instead, this is as slow as a snail's pace.
There are no dice blocks. Instead, the minigames actually start at the beginning of every turn. How far you move depends on how well you ranked in the minigame. Unfortunately, the minigames suffer from feeling like being made under a low budget, and were nowhere as fun as Mario Party minigames. Everything felt so static and soulless, especially in minigames where you drive a kart or throw darts/""discs"".

As a player walks across the board's spaces, there's no telling what BS could happen. There are Spring spaces (bounce player forward), Return spaces (opposite), spaces where a bunch of a player's coins could be taken away or earned easily. and Store spaces where players could spend on cheapness such as moving forward or SENDING OTHER PLAYERS BACK SPACES. Yeah, that's pretty fair, am I right?

With all that said, my first and so far only playthrough on one of the boards was dreadful. There were so many times where I couldn't land on a Store space, and I haven't even landed on a Spring space, yet the CPUs had several times. The fact that I won was nothing short of a miracle

I would have given this 2 stars, but the thing is - I never had fun with it. Even with crap games like Sonic 2006 or Rock & Roll Adventures, I've found a way to get at least a little bit of enjoyment out of them. But with this? I was rather stressed out by how luck-based many moves felt."
256778,1,"So, I looked over all the reviews here and thought I'd try out this cool looking headset. But when I connected it and started using it online, I was absolutely amazed at how bad it was, there was crackling on both ends(mic & speaker, it sounded liked the other players voices were speaking through a motorcycle helmet it sounded SO muffled and vice versa when I asked how I sounded, just a bad product, Stick with your old PS3 Sony Headset, its really not all that bad til you try one of these...

On a positive note, a 5 Star rating for Amazon, They are Fully refunding me for this unit."

155021,1,"As a fan of playing tennis, I was very eager to try Top Spin 3. Since I use my Wii for exercise as well as entertainment, I like to play sports games -- especially tennis ones -- to get some activity. However, although I was initially looking forward very eagerly to Top Spin 3, I found that its execution was seriously lacking.

For one, there are only a handful of players even available, some of which aren't really all that intuitive to guess. I'm not a follower of professional tennis very closely, but even I could see that there are some glaring omissions. Also, there is no character creation, so the individual element is completely absent. They added a few original characters, but they somehow felt that they could not even include a rudimentary character creation mode? Sloppy.

What is most sloppy, however, and utterly disappointing is the game itself. No difficulty settings means that the unforgiving and often very bad control scheme has to be accustomed to on the fly. A pathetically inadequate tutorial does not excuse this fundamental omission. Furthermore, the controls themselves are as far from intuitive as possible; the controller is, for some reason, held sideways. The player's character moves on-screen in a stuttering mess that frequently prevents him from reaching an adequate point from which he may return the ball. The controls, which are supposed to mimic the player's own movements, rarely do this and are token at best. Typically you will try for a special shot exactly as the tutorial instructed, only to have it ignore your movements or misinterpret them.

That doesn't even begin to address the other fundamental problems it has, such as the fact that it doesn't feel like you actually control anything. Even the pop-up help instructs you to time your swings to match the on-screen player. Why, then, are we instructed to swing at all, if the game itself tries to anticipate our swing and then make us match theirs?

I thought that Top Spin 3 would surely be more satisfying than Sega Superstars Tennis which, while a pretty good game, lacked in tournaments and was too harsh when it came to unlockables through them. There also wasn't that much responsiveness depending on specific motions by the player, which Top Spin 3 was supposed to address. Unfortunately, however, it didn't. Sega Superstars Tennis remains a vastly superior game, both in entertainment value and tennis authenticity, even with the super moves.

To boot, Sega Superstars Tennis also had three control schemes, which Top Spin 3 would have benefited from; the movement in Top Spin 3 is atrocious and unresponsive at the worst times. Having an option to handle it automatically would have been a great relief. However, they opted for the extremely awkward option of holding the Wii remote sideways, for no valid reason.

All in all, Top Spin 3 plays like an unfinished tech demo that should never have left the studio. It's a poor excuse for a tennis game, but moreover it's a poor excuse for a game overall. With horrible music, barely adequate sound effects (and an absolutely gratingly annoying umpire/judge voice that belches out his calls), and mediocre graphics, it looks like an unfinished PS2 game that they thought they could slap a full asking price on and sell.

This game isn't even worth bargain bin trips. Give it a miss and buy Sega Superstars Tennis instead, or wait for a more satisfying realistic tennis game. Top Spin 3 isn't it. In fact, it isn't much of anything at all."

426469,1,"I cant find anything in this game that really stands out that would place it above other games of the CRPG genre.  Any game that has regenerating crates and barrels that you can smash for gold, and pop-up monsters that come out of the ground out of nowhere takes this genre back about 10 years and in computer years, that makes this game ancient.  A definite no-go for me, there's too many other good games out there, including ancient ones (Arx Fatalis is a fantastic game that I would much rather play than this tripe)."

338840,1,"This was a 5/5 game. I've played it through on the 360 and it was great. But on the Xbox One, I'm stuck with a game ending bug. I cannot play through again since the bug could easily occur again so there's no point...

I backed out of the game when it was idle and it has corrupted a save. When the game loads, I hear a campfire but the screen is black and I cannot move or hit any buttons. Restoring from cloud does nothing. Square Enix forums, Xbox forums all seem to know about the bug...When it's fixed, I'll update again...

Update: I contacted the Square Enix tech support folks and they are supposedly taking gamertags of those affected. It took a couple of complaint emails -- their first responses are idiotic (please adjust the sound in the sound settings - how the hell would I do that if I can't even press any button whatsover - and who actually believes adjusting the sound would unfreeze a game - absolutely moronic response).

There are a few current crazy theories on how to fix this error. 1 way involves using 2 xbox's (you recover the gamesave to the new xbox (not sure if the 2nd one should or shouldn't be patched). another involves trying to pull down your save via cloud but disrupting it so it doesn't work, then creating a new game, playing to one of the cutscenes, then going back to the old save. I've tried something like this and it didn't seem to do anything...I'm going to try again with a more involved process...

Pretty stupid..."

Anyway I'm filing a complaint on Amazon and asking for my money back."
323479,1,"I don't think you can hit Play and enjoy an instant, easy, stress free racing game. Game forces you to join a team and forces play through pre-determined not-very-much-fun challenges. I've tried playing this a few times and quit after 10 minutes each time."
64650,1,"I'm an Orson Scott Card fan so I really wanted to like it--but it's just a terrible game.  The psychic powers are so overwhelming they feel like cheats.  With several of the powers you can clear the entire screen of baddies once every two seconds or so for the entire game so the only way to have fun is to intentionally weaken yourself.  The weapons are unsatisfying and a confusing chore to select.

The best thing about the ""flick targeting system"" is that you can ignore it.  The baddies come in Serious Sam type waves to be mowed down by your double guns plus smart-bomb psychic powers, so precise targeting is pretty silly.  Navigating your character is frustrating. You can stand next to a platform you're supposed to grab onto and jump many times before your hands latch on to the edge.  I died from that and the buggy jump controls more than from fighting the bad guys.

About half the sound effects are flat out missing, so many actions have little impact. Overall the game feels very untested and buggy.  The story is kinda cool but VERY lightweight next to Card's novels.  The characters maintain their same flippant attitude no matter how many of their own people die around them. If you're used to playing quality FPS games like H-L2, FEAR, Call of Duty, etc you will be disappointed."

I mean, this game blows. Its Conflict Desert Storm with a different case and slightly different missions and characters. This game is such a disgrace to the COD series. I LOVED 1,2, and 3. This one BLOWS!!!!! Get Army of Two/BioShock/R6V/R6V2 and put your 60 dollars to good use. See you later!

UPDATE4/12-I know Halo is unrealistic. I think everybody knows that. At least this game is somewhat realistic. But
1)Turrets Overheat in this game. TURRETS DONT OVERHEAT!!! I've shot turrets before, and you have to reload them after 100 shots(which you don't do in COD4 i think you know), BUT THEY DONT FU**ING OVERHEAT!! WTF!!
2)Why cant you take silencers off the guns? I know you cant do that in AO2, so don't tell me. But why cant you reach down, and screw the silencer off. Thats BS
3)Graphics. Sure they look great. BUT ONLY IF YOU  STAY PUT IN 1 ROOM. THEN THEY ALL LOOK THE FREAKIN SAME!!!

The mouse worked perfectly at first but after a few months of moderate use, it starts acting up. Side buttons would stop working. Mouse laser completely shuts off.

197682,1,"I would not recommend the sequel to anyone simply because it does not live to any of the expectations it was amounted to. The new infected characters are lousy and not very creative, it has become overly complicated and lost all of its fun as well as a notable decrease in the quality of graphics. It is no wonder Valve has spent over $25 million dollars advertising the game since otherwise it would have failed, which I believe it definitely deserves to. Instead of adding to the first feature of the game the company rushed through a second production in a year coming up with something that is pretty much useless and much worse than the first game. Left 4 Dead 2 does not really bring anything new, in the sense of concept, it just changes characters which I could do very well by using some skins and provides some new maps to shoot each other in. Not worth it."

Even the gore is fake looking and really unnecessary if you ask me.  Don't waste your money on this game unless you need something to go under the leg of a table to balance it or something.  This game is misrepresented by it's description as it says you are a cia agent using stealth and strategy when all you do is run and shoot the whole time. Avoid this game like the plague."

This is a game that is defective and due to the defect, freezes.  So, even if someone has very low standards, they could not honestly give a defective game 5 stars.  Well, take a look at the 5 star reviews here and you can finally see proof that there really are planted, fake reviews. Call me naive for needing this type of evidence, but guess I am too much the optimist. Now, who do we think planted them? lol"

Oh my God!!! I was too busy yawning to be even the slightest scared.  I FINALLY got to and wandered around the prison for a while trying to find stuff and finally said, ""Enough is enough"" and deleted this lame piece of tedium from my computer.  Look, if you're into traipsing around some town and it's various structures in the fog and dark, endlessly looking around for doors and hard to see items to add to your inventory and solving puzzles, which I hate doing, than this is the game for you.  The dialogue is awful, the story is pathetic, the combat is lame and I get more scared opening the door to kiddies on Halloween night for crying out loud.  I was getting so weary with this thing I finally downloaded a walkthrough just to end my agony and I still said to heck with this.  Life is too short.  I never felt so good freeing up space on my hard drive. After reading all the reviews about how scary this game is and after playing Doom 3, FEAR and Dead Space, which were scary, I was really disappointed with this game.  In fairness I must say I played the game on easy, easy on puzzles and easy on combat.  Maybe it's scarier on hard but I'm not going to hang around to find out."

-The Suzuki Hayabusa is a free DLC in the Day One Edition of the game which I have. Should be standard.

-There are bikes as rewards, but I don't know what category they are. It should be listed what class it is 'cause I don't know just by looking at them always. Overall I do know them, but to me they're all motorbikes. List the category of the reward bikes.

-I can't ride the H2 or H2R in sport or supersport races because the H2 and H2R are given a class of their own. The cover bike has so little available show in the game.

-I'd like the ability to do a full custom paint job of the bikes and not have such little limitations. I'd like Gran Turismo options or something.

-When you try to sell a bike, it'll be at a loss. In Shift 2, you can sell cars and get back all of the money you put into it. Another way this game extends the grind to get you to buy the money/race DLC thing.

229419,1,"Thought it was a version of Angry Birds that played like the popular cell phone game, instead it was more of a regular arcade game. Disappointed."
296954,1,"The first couple of reviews for this game is exactly on point. This game looks, sounds, feels like an original XBOX game.  I thought we were past horrible game development but I guess not. The graphics, sound, driving mechanics, repetitive missions are are horrible.

They need to release a Fast and Furious arcade port from the driving/racing game where you race to upgrade your car.  That arcade had a cruising USA feel but was really fun."
467173,1,"As much as I love Nintendo to death, I was never a fan of the Wii. Although there were a lot of classics like Super Mario Galaxy, Madworld, Boom Blox and Twilight Princess, there was a crapton of shovelware. Out of all the Wii games I've played, this has to be the worst of the worst. The gameplay is extremely repetitive,  the graphics look like they belong on the Philips Cdi, the music is bland and annoying and the plot is stupid (yes, this game actually has a plot). Basically, the plot of the game is that you're a farmer who all the sudden decides to shoot his chickens for no reason, that's it and there's even a cutscene of it which is absolutely pointless for such a simple plot. When you get in the game, you'll realize how boring the game is. All your doing is pointing your wiimote at the screen and shooting chickens and the sounds they make are so obnoxious. Heck, some of them don't even look like chickens, despite the game being called Chicken Shoot. Unless you've played it for yourself, you have no idea how unsatisfying and boring this game is. In my opinion, this is probably the third worst game ever made, only behind CrazyBus on the Genesis and Hong Kong 97 on the Super Famicom, it's that bad. If you want a good game where you shoot birds, play Duck Hunt. Unlike this pile of Chicken S*** (no pun intended), Duck Hunt is very fun to play. It actually feels satisfying to shoot something and it's not even boring because it actually plays like a game, I love Duck Hunt so much despite how annoying the dog is. Heck, Duck Hunt is so good that the dog and the duck are playable in Smash Bros! Are you gonna see any of these stupid chickens or that farmer in Smash Bros? Nope, because this game is garbage."

Halo multiplayer is also extremely flawed. In Blood Gulch, good banshee pilots will simply start spawn killing and the opposing team won't be able to get a foothold in the battle (CTF).
Or worse, you have team killers who also ruin the fun.
The banshee and warthog interface isn't what I expected.
If they used the Descent engine for the Banshee, and Rallisport Challenge for the Warthog, then it'd be one heck of a game.
Overall, it's not worth the money to buy this game since it's already 2 years old. Save your money for something up to date and more fun."

330779,1,"I had high hopes for the Venus mouse.  First off the packaging is nice, still smiling at this point.  The mouse also feels pretty darn good in my hand.  Comfortable and ergonomic enough. After getting through a bit of the Chinglish (poorly written English, from China) I got the mouse installed and working.  This is where things start to get bad.

The smooth plastic footing was stuck on crooked and was peeling up in two places.  Not a huge deal as they provide a replacement with the mouse.  The tuning weights were also not included with my mouse.  There is a black container but not metal weights in it or the mouse.  :(

The most important thing for a gaming mouse (imho) is the ability to track well as well as programmable buttons for MMO.  The list of features, and price, look good but the tracking is pretty bad.  I am using an expensive gaming mouse pad and thought this might be the problem.  I tried it on a wooden desk and also with a plain black mouse pad.  Long story short there is significant lag and jittery movement.  I restarted my gaming rig, I tried re-installing the software, etc... It would work well for 20-60 seconds and then the cursor would hop around.  I have a hard time believing this is true 16,400 DPI.  I have no way of figuring this out.  If it is a true 16,400 DPI mouse it must be using an inexpensive sensor.

Sadly the tracking issues are bad enough that I can't use this mouse for gaming let alone daily use."

They really dropped the ball on this one and it's fair to say that I will not be buying another product from these developers. To switch the genre of game when your previous games were so much fun is a massive mistake.

Vote with your dollars. If you have already bought the game and are dissatisfied, request a refund from amazon(or your vendor of choice) as this product is defective.

If you have not already bought the game, see below.

Do not buy if:

-You are otherwise without internet for any period of time when you might play

-You care about consumer rights"
328163,1,"I got this hooked up to my PC with minimal fuss. I plugged the USB cable and optical cable into the base and my PC. I configured the Windows audio to use the USB for communications and the Optical for sound. The instructions are pretty vague but it isn't too difficult to figure out.

I charged the headset fully. Then I put them on to try them out and to my horror there was a constant buzz in the right channel. Not a blow my ears out buzz but a nice low annoying buzz like electronic interference generated by computer equipment if you know what I mean. It didn't change frequency often but does alternate once in a while between two different pitches. It persisted in the background and was audible through music and sounds during quieter spots.

I tried disconnecting from my PC thinking it was the source but it still persisted. I tried putting a ferrite core on the USB cable and it didn't help. Even when I power the base off and plugged my cell phone directly into the headset with the included cable it persisted.

I normally use a set of Corsair Vengeance 2000 wireless headphones on my PC and a set of Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 earphones everywhere else.

In my testing I found the sound to be average at best. The bass was there but the mids and highs sounded off to me. Especially the highs sounding harsh to me. I even think the Turtle Beach PX4 wireless headphones sounded better than these and I wasn't too crazy about those either.

Nothing else I could say about this headset really matters with the constant buzzing problem. It is unacceptable to me. I did a search for afterglow buzzing and found lots of hits for PDP headphones, this and other models. Maybe I got a bad set but with the number of hits I got in my search I question the quality control or maybe even the overall design. I am not sure what is causing the buzz but I know that none of the other wired or wireless speakers and headsets that I have exhibited a buzz like this. It isn't too often that I dislike a product enough to give it one star but this one just rubs me the wrong way. Even if it didn't buzz I don't think that I'd like it that much due to the way it sounds to me.

Overall in my opinion a headset that I would not recommend. If you do decide to try them make sure you get them from somewhere with a good return policy so you can try them out and return them if you don't like them or have buzzing like I do."
274061,1,"I'd hold off a bit until they work some bugs out. I installed, then had to un-install to get it working. I actually havnt played it yet but I am a big fan of all the GR series. I am sure I won't be disappointed, but I'd wait for it to be cheaper and less buggy. The forums had some PO'd people on it. It appears it may have been a quick release or a bad ""port over"" from a console. I really don't care what it is/was as long as it plays well. Hold off though.

UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

The forums are a bloodbath and tech support is overwhelmed. There are many horror stories.
The game CTD's for many many people. I could not even get it to run for 3 weeks. It CTD'd before getting to the main screen. I finally had to fix it myself by uninstalling and re-installing many times and trying different methods. My key was to NOT let it patch the first time and setup the game first with the orgininal version 1.0 Once I got that to run, I saved all my settings and then let the game auto patch.

If you are a fan of the Ghost series, you might be disappointed. This is a port over from a console game. Very badly. some fo the in game screens are from an Xbox! lol.
There is not ""first person"" view. Extremely disappointing for me. I haven't played much but I don't believe there is any AI. It took like 10 minutes to find and join a MP session. I had no control over selection of servers. It just placed me in one.

Frankly, at the moment its a horror story. I'd hold off buying until it hits the bargain bin ,,, or the waste bin. Its not worth the current price."

Simple Summary Review - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
This keyboard is a very nice looking keyboard that functions decently as a keyboard. However, considering the premium price, I expect that the advertised features work and that this keyboard, at a minimum, functions as a keyboard should with no unexpected and unbelievably frustrating behavior. Unfortunately, not with this product or brand. After going through 2 keyboards over a period of 2 years, I'm throwing this device in the trash where it belongs. I'll never buy a Razer product again.

Pros - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard is truly a beautiful piece of plastic. I'm a particular fan of the matte buttons, which are hard to get dirty and easy to clean.
 - It is perfectly visible and usable in completely dark environments.
 - The buttons are very easy to press, leading to less wrist strain over long periods of time.

Cons - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard has a severe issue of getting stuck signals. It's like a key is stuck, but it's not. The only way to resolve is by unplugging the keyboard. This happens quite regularly, even without using the keyboard at all. I can't count the number of mornings I've woken up, turned on my monitor, only to find my keyboard just a typing an infinitely long Windows password on my locked computer. It's dreadfully annoying in gaming environments. Example: ""Sorry guys, I didn't mean to pull the boss. My keyboard is acting wierd!""
 - The media controller (touchpad) is absolutely useless. I have never gotten it to work, and it always goes crazy. It will regularly turn your volume down. It will constantly flash the keyboard lights. It will always start playing music when you aren't even near your computer. I contacted Razer support, and you know what they suggested? That I put a quarter on it! Yes, it a quarter will completely disable the touchpad. So for the past 2 years, I've been using a quarter to keep my wonky keyboard under my control, sacrificing one of the biggest reasons I wanted the keyboard to begin with.
 - The included USB port doesn't work. The power strength is a fraction of what normal USB ports are from my computer (so charging a phone, for example, takes multiples longer than using a USB port on the back of the computer). In addition, I've yet to get any device to actually function in it. Thumb drives are so convenient to plug in there, but the port simply doesn't work. Yes, I plugged both cables on the keyboard in. It just doesn't work.
 - The lights appear very dull through the buttons. This can be a pro or a con, as the lights shouldn't be distracting. However, I think it's just a little too dull, as it looks like the lights are failing. Pop a key off, though, and it's plain to see that the actual light source underneath is insanely bright.

In Hindsight
==========
I wish I had more nice things to say, but unfortunately, the truth is what it is. I wish I wasn't initially blinded by brand name, and I wish I would have done more research. Unfortunately, the past is the past, and the money spent on these 3 Razer products is lost forever. I hope Razer can fix their products in future generations, but I will never give them another shot. This is a premium product with a premium design. However, the functionality of their devices are equivalent of cheap knock-offs made in China."
402201,1,"The original XCOM is one of the best games ever made. I liked the more recent one okay enough, but it felt a little empty and so I was looking forward to XCOM 2 which promised more content.

Well the game looks great and seems to have the content, but ti's badly broken. Steam refunded me - I'll wait a year and see if it's all patched up then. I should have listened to reviews."
363144,1,too difficult and not enough hints to even be bothered playing this game. I hated it

396746,1,"I would like to give a higher rating, however I just can't bring myself to. I had the highest expectations for this game and it did not deliver. I pre-ordered back in August and when it arrived I played for a week straight. After that I would play maybe a couple times a week, now I haven't played it in over a month. This game has no replay value and once you get over the initial awe of Star Wars sounds and environments, it is just re-skinned Battlefront with less functionality and NO CAMPAIGN WHATSOEVER. If they would have delivered the exact same minimalist single player campaign that Battlefront 2 had ten years ago I would have given this a 4 star rating.

To top it off the content is extremely limited and they want you to pay another $50 for the season pass!!! When the game 10 years ago already had so much more. $110 for an incomplete game? No thanks.

What a joke, although I guess that is to be expected with EA."
271094,1,"As a long, long time fan of Sim City, this was a day 1 purchase for me. Along with the rest of the world, I was in for a gaming hell attempting to even play. With features of the game being shut off, and no way to play offline at launch, I was along many that for weeks had an unbearable experience even attempting to play the game. After getting one city finally in a ""cool"" state, my area ran out of resources and shuttling in new ones wasn't functioning. Everything I struggled to build, died shortly after. I tossed the game on my shelf and haven't looked back since.

Maxis has tried with several patches to fix things, but each time it sounds like they break just as much. Just recently they have announced an offline patch, so there is a chance the game has come along ways and would be enjoyable again. Personally, i'm not willing to back at this point. A sad story of an amazing franchise."
277509,1,"Update: I am now having the doubleclick issue, so I have to buy a new mouse. Also, the Logitech software is loaded with SPYWARE.

Intermittently drops out during play when used in hardware mode. Not portable in the sense that you can config it on hardware, put it on any computer, *and expect it to perform reliably during play.* It's not a gaming mouse, if it doesn't perform reliably. Also incredibly frustrating is the extra third click button's incredibly low tactile feedback compared to the other two. it's mushy and inaudible, and feels the way your mouse would click if you'd been gumming it up on your desk for 2 years already.

Update:
Now using only the offboard profiles.
The software has been very buggy and sometimes completely ignores my user-set lighting settings (static obviously) in favor of running its little crazy pulsing breathing color-cycling demo mode. Very annoying and distracting esp in the dark.

The tilt-switches (left-right/forward-back) on the scroll-wheel don't have consistent tactile feedback between left and right so one of them you have to push a little harder than the other. Kinda distracting.

The 12-key has every button labeled something like ""G9"" through ""G17"" to represent ""1"" through ""9"". Yes, 1 is G9 and 9 is G17. Logitech are total idiots and this is the sad result of overbranding.

The 12-key is a little soft, chunky, and *wobbly,* hard to tell if you're over the right button and reduces overall stability of your grip on the mouse while you're activating. Something a bit more rigid and *not totally loose in its housing* would be more ideal for fast-paced precision gaming, which again, this mouse does not fit the bill for. It is nowhere near the quality a pro or even weekend FPS player would be looking for.

Update 2: Wow, I still can't stop the lights on this thing from pulsing when they decide randomly they want to do that. I verify the config is set to all effects off. If I don't want distracting pulses I have to kill the lights entirely. Boy am I tired of throwing money away on garbage. This mouse just lost a core feature, because it's unusably f annoying. No more RGB lighting."
121688,1,"After all these years playing video games I'm still searching for one like Nato Commander (Commodore 64). I was hoping this would be it. This is more like Command and Conquer(PC). Though I like Command and Conquer better.  The voice control is the only thing cool about this game.

 I felt like I had very little control over my troops, tanks and helicopters....and then when you give them a command they attack as if its a free for all....totally un-organized and very unrealistic. To me the way they attack you'd think they had 0 training, no clue of war strategy, and a dead commander.

I was also disappointed with the view of the action going on....it would be nice if you could zoom in and out your view of the battle field....

....rent it first, then buy it if you like it....I wish I would have, then I could have saved $60+tax."
16575,1,"I am serious. This game is the worst wrestling game ever made next to WCW Nitro for Playstation but it ranks up there with it. This game has two modes, no endings, 20 Characters, no entrances lame move sets and looks like a really nice textured Smackdown. I suggest u rent it for a night and when ure ready to throw it out the window return it. THQ failed at making a game and im appauled at the way this games average review is 4 stars. THIS GAME IS BAD! And this is coming from a gamer of 20 years...."
63928,1,"Man, this $50 game from the Big Corporation called Electronic Arts totally stinks.  It's got some of the worst car racing physics I've ever seen, and the controls are totally user-unfriendly.  The cars handle like crazy, and the A.I. of the computer-controlled racers is totally uneven and takes away the last bit of fun from this game.  Don't waste your $50 on a crappy game like this.  I'm already very pissed I wasted $7 renting it from Blockbuster.  Even though I could have kept it for two weeks, I returned it after less than one.  This game truly sucks, big time.

If you want a good racer for the PSP, check out Ridge Racer, which, admittedly, is a different kind of racing experience but at least it's got good car physics models in it.  Or just wait for the release of Gran Turismo or Burnout."
274149,1,"It's like they made an Elder Scrolls game and removed all the good things about the Elder Scrolls, and they made an MMO  minus all the good interface and interaction of an MMO.  If anything this should be a free to play, waste of money for this product, but the story is dry, graphics are ok, not a lot of impact in combat or PvP.  They basically sacrificed having a good game trying to make it more immersive and failed.  Bethesda should of stuck to console ES."
228487,1,"I'm a huge fan of shooting gallery games and have been ever since playing Operation Wolf in the arcades and Capone on the Commodore Amiga back in the day.  I was raised on Taito shooters and weened on Time Crisis.  Lucky for me, the advent of the Playstation Move has afforded the PS3 some good light gun games, including Time Crisis, The Shoot, House of the Dead Overkill, and Dead Space: Extraction.  They're not the most advanced games on the planet, and that's undoubtedly reflected in their review scores, but if you're looking for shooting galleries on hi-def system, you could do worse.

Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is the aforementioned ""worse.""  Oh, boy, is it ever worse.

There are so many things disastrously bad about this game, I don't know where to begin.  Remember Area 51 and Maximum Force back in the arcades?  Remember how cheesy they looked, even at a time when full-motion video in arcade games was ""hip""?  Hell, do you remember Revolution X with Aerosmith?

HFA is a worse-made product than all three of them.  While the environments you pass through during missions are passably animated, the animation of all characters is amateurish and looks about early Playstation 2-level.  That would be excusable (heck, I like Crypt Killer and that game is ugly as sin) if it weren't for the actual FEEL of moving in the environments and interacting with these generic Taliban ragdolls.

For one, the controls are misbegotten.  You CANNOT use this game with any gun controller because the default controls are so needlessly complicated.  Instead of adopting Time Crisis' system of reloading and seeking cover with a single button press, HFA seeks to emulate the controls of a first-person shooter:  You need to press X, O, Move button, and trigger to do different things at different times, and simply taking cover requires moving the Move controller itself in some arbitrary direction while holding down a button.  It's NONSENSE.  Whoever thought up this control scheme is a masochist without any penchant for the light gun genre.

The firefighting itself is no better.  The Move controller requires a more finicky calibration than in other light gun games, and you'll notice that the smallish reticle will move in a jerky motion no matter how you've set it up.  Foes jump out from the requisite positions of ""behind generic crate"" and ""next to exploding, conveniently-placed barrel,"" but your only indication that their poorly animated firing is hitting you is a tiny bullet hole in glass and perhaps a chip off your health bar.  You could be excused for thinking you breezed through one of the game's levels only to find out you were actually hit three times--you just didn't notice.  Hit detection on the enemies is similarly and predictably poor.

Perhaps most hilariously, a giant SAVING GAME message appears WHILE enemies are shooting at you and obstructs your view!  What genius came up with that brilliant idea?!

Somewhere in all this mess, there's an actual story and lots of levels in which the player does generic Military Video Game things, like shoot from turrets and... shoot from turrets on helicopters.  The setting, ""story,"" and main character all feel so rote and tired that the game and its use of Afghanistan end up feeling more exploitative and insulting to our men and women fighting there than it does patriotic.

Perhaps if they had made a better video game....

Look, if you're like me, you're a shooting gallery fan who is interested in this game because you figure it will give you something of a cross between Time Crisis and Modern Warfare for a budget price.  Let me spare you the misery: Don't be tempted.  At $19.99, Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is approximately $19.98 too expensive."
395266,1,"Worst gaming experience EVER, bar none!!!! Avoid like the PLAGUE! Seriously, it is worse than the black death!

Pros:
Its not Battlefront
can quit while 'host'
video glitches in MP seem fixed (apprently they traded glitchy lens flares for a complete crash - way to trade up there guys!)
uninstaller does NOT crash

Cons:
Controller aim-assist!  How is that NOT an aimbot??
Empty servers (unless you like deathmatch modes)
The Lobbies
The limitless number of prestige'd ""pro-players"" who still live in mommy's basement/garage/attic.
No players in the FUN game modes. Nothing but DM players, cuz wtf?
Matchmaking is typically 6 lvl 40 vs 3 lvl 2-6. Seems fair I guess?
Black Ops III Stoped Working (just because??)
Hosting a game == hard reboot required
Playing a game == hard boot required
The crashes. OMFG the crashes.
Forced hard reboots count as ""Play Time"" apparently.
Balance?  WTF is THAT?
Zombie mode?  Really?  That's just hands-down asstarded!

Worst gaming experience EVER, bar none!!!!"
453645,1,"Sound is crackly and stutters. Other issues,too. Would not buy again. Should actually get zero stars. Deadly Dozen Pacific plays well. This one does not."

329930,1,"I got something completely different than is listed here, on the box and in the directions, the base that I have does not have any lighted controller symbols or lights to show it has power, I also left both controllers in the base all night and neither charged, very disappointed."
348693,1,"Within a month, two of the USB ports stopped working. By two months of owning this, neither one of the controller chargers worked and by three months the fan began to fail to cool the PS4 at all. A good purchase if you are a Rockefeller and don't mind wasting money."

436517,1,Horrible game loading problem bad graphics very boring not what I expected
74923,1,"On BioWare's official site, Kingmaker costs $8, Kingmaker Lite costs $6. Shadowguard costs $5 & comes with Witch's Wake for free, putting this pacakge at a value between $11 & $13. Apparently, the box they come in & disc they're burned on cost between $6 & $8, making this a bad value.

There is a reason BioWare is selling Shadowguard & Witch's Wake on their website at 2 for $5, & that reason is that Shadowguard & Witch's Wake are incomplete modules with unresolved cliffhanger endings. In Shadowguard, you're just about to persuit the party that razed your city & killed your father, & that's where it ends.

Kingmaker is a good mod. Do buy it, but don't buy this overpriced set to get it."
376238,1,"Great mouse, feels good in my hand all day long.

UPDATE: This piece of junk broke after exactly 8 months of use. I sat down at my computer this afternoon and the mouse was unresponsive, weird. A couple minutes later the lights turned off, okay. Plugged it in and out, 2.0 and 3.0, reinstalled the infamous synapse crapware, tried a different computer, prayed to the ancient cannibal gods, you know the usual stuff. Now I need to decide if I'm going to use this thing for batting practice or see if it I can chop wood on top of it, you know recycling is important to me, go green!"
317204,1,Returned you sick at making games.
5149,1,"It doesn't make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it ""best game of all-time"" or ""best Castlevania game you'll ever play"".
I don't think so.  If you want a ""real"" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That's how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.
Don't believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.
After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.
Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there!
But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.
Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face.
Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.
You're probably thinking by now ""Alright, talk about the actual GAME!""  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down.
I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.
Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy.
Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it."
121021,1,"Pros:
lots of customizable buttons
glides the best of any mouse I have used
I liked the razor software

Cons:

Stopped working after a week I had to return it, the mouse would no longer track
didn't fit my hand well- though I adjusted the way I held it, it was ok at best, crummy at worst
the build quality was cheap, it had some rough edges
The buttons weren't placed very well, it was hard to use the side buttons.

I have a death adder that I love, but it just doesn't have enough buttons for me, and having on the fly DPI adjustments is important to me...maybe not others. I have had MANY different mice over the years, the Lachesis looked good on paper, but not in the real world. The Lachesis seemed to work really well until it just stopped tracking. The buttons still worked and so did the scroll wheel, but it wouldn't track. I would have to say this mouse is pretty much a failure for Razor, especially when you read all of the people are having problems with this thing. Too bad.

I would have to recommend staying away from this mouse, there are too many good ones out there. I decided to replace this with the cyborg RAT7.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyborg-R-A-T-7-Gaming-Mouse-for-PC/dp/B003CP0BHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyborg R.A.T. 7 Gaming Mouse for PC</a>&nbsp;Maximum PC gave it a 10 kick a$$ award, I am going to give it a try.

211201,1,"I bought this on sale at $40 from Amazon which is $30 more than it's worth if single player only is your thing. From the get-go the game is nothing but repetitive sequences of sit-and-watch cinematics with some guy screaming at the main character strapped to a chair and hurling F-bombs every other word followed by short linear action events, all of which got so tiring I was repeatedly hitting the skip key. The graphics are the only positive thing I can say about this iteration of CoD. PC Gamer magazine was right with it's review that - paraphrasing - likened CoD:BO to the Titanic having struck an iceberg. Absolutely no single player replay value whatsoever."

470981,1,"Hoo boy. Look at the pictures before buying. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this game, but it was not another installment in the series the way I wanted it to be. It's on me for not looking into it before I picked it up."
18296,1,"This game isn't as good as most of the 1st person shooters on the PS1. For a release on the PS2 this is a pathetic excuse. You'd be better off buying Syphon Filter 1 or 2, or Medal of Honor for the PS1, or waiting for new versions of those games to come out on the PS2."

My monitor is 1920x1200. I'm guessing it's trying to launch in something like 2560x?. I'm stuck because I have to start the game to change the resolution and I can't start the game because of the resolution.

I'm using the latest patch.

Hopefully EA will come out with a patch for windows 7.

I played it in Vista on my old computer and it was pretty good."
148648,1,"I played the first Starcraft and I enjoyed it as RTS was so new back then. This one is better graphics but similar gameplay, so what is my issue? Simple, same as Diablo 3, a server connection is always needed but so many people are playing at the same time that you are disconnected. I do not even do multiplayer online, don't have time for a crowd to join but I must stay online, fine I do and it still drops me. Before it was just perfect if you had to keep your game disk in and Blizzard would play for you knowing you could not copy their media at all. And I do have disks for this game which I purchased from Newegg or Amazon, don't remember which but I must quit after so many times I get disconnected. NOOOO, my internet service is on, I can go Ebay too and I am writing this on Amazon as soon as I got dumped by Blizzard server. This is exactly why I stopped playing Diablo 3. Frankly, I have the Reaper of soul and Heart of the swarm still in shrink wrap but I cannot tell anyone go buy Blizzard, if this is the best they can do for you."
169286,1,"Rockstar Games Social Club and Windows Live requirements just KILL this game for said reasons in the reviews ... and patches do not work.  It is like the STEAM STORMTROOPER COMPANY;  RUINING EVERY GAME THEY TOUCH.  But this time around it is not for GREED (as with the STEAM CO.).  It is so strange that I have absolutely NO problems with any other games on PC EXCEPT when STEAM is involved.  And now RG Social Club/ Windows Live, appear to cause the same type problems.  LEAVE THE GAMES ALONE !!!

Update: with some calls - got it going. my son loved the game,  Hated the R.G.'s Social Club and Windows Live crap (doesn't use it) and I didn't appreciate the R.G.'s Social Club icon latching onto my toolbar.  Leave the game alone!!!"
4666,1,"Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west. The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan. Built on a dated engine with wonky physics, Dated graphics and a 2.5D design. Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI. Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies, Find key, Open door, Shoot more baddies, Find another Key ect ect. Outlaws is very dissapointing."
347746,1,No grip.
46414,1,"I bought this back in may 2017. I use it strictly for Star Wars Galaxy. This stick is fantastic for the JTL content.  The buttons are easily mapped and stick is stiff, but responsive. Perfect for PVP.  My gripe though seems to be a common one after doing a lot of homework on way my ship was constantly rolling to the left. The twist function within the joystick doesn't seem to be durable as I've had to set up a return order.  Now this is where I really am annoyed.

Logitech, one of the largest accessory companies has been absolutely horrible about the claim I filed.  I've been waiting days on end for a response and was forced to go go back to amazon.com to see what they'd suggest.  To my surprise, Amazon went and ok'd the return due to the manufacturer not being supportive.  Big Kudos to Amazon.

Overall: maybe I just got a bad joy..  I really like the stick during the first few months of ownership. It's comfortable and ofters a wide variety of buttons that's convenient for your casual flyer. I've seen other sticks with separate throttle and buttons on this, but to be honest, i'm a lazy pilot and I don't want to have to figure out 2 controls vs having everything on one package. If something could be done about the poor durability for the twist function,  I think you would have a product, but like I said, maybe it's just a defective joy.

UPDATE:  11/14 -- Upon ordering a replacement, that was fulfilled by Amazon.com for a new replacement. I received a clunky oversized box and the joystick in a bag. No packing materials like popcorn. Needless to say, being livid is an understatement.  It's busted too.  Amazon has issued a refund for #2.

Honestly...  Don't buy this.  No joystick is worth this much headache."
138013,1,"This game blew me away with the opening.  It looks like a movie, Hollywood all the way!  Then you get to the race, and it all falls down.  Sure, it still looks spectacular, with smooth scrolling scenery and beautifully rendered tracks and cars, but then you hit the gas.  Then you hit the wall.  Then you hit the other wall!  Then you switch from wheel to gamepad, and hit more walls.  Then you finally try the keyboard, and nothing but wall!  The controls are beyond horrible.  You have ALL right, ALL left, or shaky center.  As soon as you get over 30 MPH, you'll start drifting.  As soon as you try to correct that drift, you'll find the nearest wall.  Simple as that.  I've tried all the sensitivity settings in the game and the only difference between them is how far you have to turn the wheel (or move the analog stick) before the car does its FULL turn.  It seems like such a simple thing that could really fix this game, but there it is.  Steer clear of this game while you still can steer!"

96054,1,"I am a shamed to say i purchased this game, it was brilliant until after you kill 200 ""baddies"" using the glave it's all the same old splat and blood, only 2 or 3 close range kills that get old quick. Guns sound under powered and uninspired. I feel that i have heard better sounding guns on the Mega drive.

Some of the skills you unlock for the glave are fun like shocking people with a flying glave is fun the first few times, but after that it's same old same old. Puzzles are the same one or two are difficult then they get easy.

Boss fights yawn o rama just lately i am feeling that boss battles aren't challenging in most games.

I am sorry if liked this game, but for what it was made out to be... just a waste of good game funds that could of been better spent

Not even worth a purchase from the bargain bin

Thanks for reading"

131188,1,"So i bought this game yesterday 6-11.  Couldnt wait to get off work so i could go play.  put the game in and actually sit through the tutorials.  Lets say i was very impressed with gameplay and how fluent it worked.... remember i am only in the tutorial.  After i finished tutorial i went to the saga.  Now being someone that owned all budokai's i was expecting a decent length and substancial storyline.  To say the least i was wrong.  I finished the story that night.  I mean what a rip i only got up to the cell saga?  I came in thinking it was all the way through to buu at least and had all the characters i came to love in budokai tenkaichi 3, seeing as that only makes sense.  What really bothers me is after each saga they fabricate a movie based on gameplay to wrapup what happened.  I think this space and time could have been better put into including a buu saga.  I mean most people just skip these low budget in game movies anyway, so why not give us something we want.  When i buy a game i buy it for substance some good gameplay.  Not half of a game with better graphics.  Btw they include the first disk of season one ......  Season one came out over a year ago and most of us fans already bought it.  Why give out something we already own.  Even worse why give out part of a season where you will still have to go out and buy the whole thing if you don't own it.  I mean seriousl what are we going to do with one out of six disks in a set.  Just a way to get ppl to sink more money into this franchise.  I strongly urge everyone to rent this game before buying so you can see exactly what its worth.  This game to me is WAS worthless and i am ashamed that they would even sell this game in the market let alone sell it for such a steep price.  Trust me you are better off getting something else.

Cons
1.  Game is short only through the cell saga.
2.  Game has cutscenes every 5 seconds during actual fighting which throw you offguard and confuse you.
3.  Maps are incredibly small.  you can successfully hit someone about 2-3 times before you hit a wall.
4.  Gamplay has no learning curve its ez to play with no skill involved
5.  YOU HAVE UNLIMITED SPECIALS with little to no delay before refire. tisk tisk
6.  Limited characters maybe 13 or so.
7.  Transformations make you weaker......why why would they do that.
8.  Game is 100% completed in one night.
9.  Absolutely no replay value at all.  I sold the game first chance i got.
10. When you near the end you hope the game finishes soon because it is soo bady.

Pro
1. Graphics look pretty good.

I know you were expecting more pro's but honestly this game is terrible."
384214,1,I just bought this from game stop for $36 this is way over priced
429260,1,"Do not buy the American version of this game. It is censored for North American consumer -ship, even though it has a Mature rating. The Japanese version will have a remove clothes mode of this game. If they removed this option, it is safe to say that other parts of this game are missing as well. DLC comes first to Japan and Chinese versions of this game. Your lucky if the DLC is released to North America"
42377,1,Okay I just tried playing the demo of this game because someone advised this. I couldn't play it. It took like 5 minutes for him to close the door. Why do they move so slowly? I couldn't stand it. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. If the game is slow like this demo I will not buy this.
252689,1,NAAAAH
371306,1,I was really hoping it would be on the same levelas doom 3 and what doom 4 looked like. Sadly this game is stuck in the 90s with not much replay value and stunted mp.
443482,1,"Easily one of the most infuriating games I have ever played and I have played every RE game. - Not being able to defend, being stuck in some stupid house for hours only to get 1 hit killed - on easy mode mind you. Games are supposed to be fun and not infuriating. I had reservations about getting it because I prefer 3rd person over 1st person but stupid me got it anyway. Never again Capcom - I cancelled my preorder or MVC infinite beacause of this stupid game. - I'll just wait until Injustice 2 comes out and play that.

I'm still playing it but I'm only doing it because I paid for it not playing out of enjoyment, which is what a game should be."
186616,1,"I started out playing Console games Back when you had to place an overlay on the TV screen before there were PC games. When Pc games came along I switched to them. I have watched Pc games get better and better over the years untill thy reached there zenith about 5 years agoe. From that point on it has been a slow down hill slide. The games themselves seemed to get less Interesting to play. The graphics did not get any better. It just took a more expensive graphics card and more memory to play them at the optium resolution. The games started having a lot of problems even on the higher PC game rigs. The players had to start downloading more Patches just to keep the games playable even then they had to learn to live with multiple Crashes. The big Game producers started Introducing More road blocks to the PC games in the form of DRM,On line activation,Limited plays,Manditory joining Social Clubs,Having to regester the game. At the same time the lowly Consoles started getting better And better Graphics. Now the Console Graphics have finally cought up with the PC.I have switched back to playing Console games. Thy are the same games,Thy come out on the Consoles first then are ported to the PC,Thy play smoother on the consoles with less problems,No DRM or any of the other problems that plague PC games. The Games cost a little more for the Consoles but on the other hand a Console Rig costs less than just A top of the line PC Graphics card. Now that new PC's come loaded onley with VISTA or WINDOWS 7 Older games can no longer be played on them while thy can still be played on the Consoles. A few years agoe I predicted that Pc gamming would become Obsolete if we continued to buy PC games with all the restrictions. All I got was a lot on Flack from PC Gamers. Now it has got even worse than I thought it would. If you don't believe I predicted this check out my older reviews. As for the game review:Assassins Creed 2 is one of the best of a bad bunch!!!!!"
271265,1,This game would be wonderful if it worked and we were given maps that are larger. Sim City is more like Sim Town. This game should have been polished more before release. EA you suck why use always online DRM in a single player game wtf. Thats why Ea will ruin all their beloved franchises and have ruined other game companys as well(Bioware).Maybe I will give this game a chance if EA can fix the darn thing in future.
295789,1,"sorry, if this is steam only I'll pass. I've had nothing but bad bad bad experiences with steam,...if I had back all the hours I've wasted with Steam, I'd have a 3 week vacation staring me in the face."
87363,2,"This game has a lot of promise, but the controls are painfully bad. I cannot fathom how many 5-star reviews this has received, especially when many of them comment on how the controls are difficult to master, can get stuck, and can be very frustrating. Not to mention that when the controls get stuck in ""turn left"" or ""turn right"" mode, it can be nauseating to watch.

Personally, I'm simply not interested in spending hours mastering the basics of a game that should be intuitive. Using the Wii controller to imitate swinging a sword should be completely natural. In this game it is just the opposite. Part of the problem is that they put both the camera ""look direction"" control and the sword control on the controller, and they don't play nicely together. It ends up that you have to use what I think of as the ""flailing hamster"" mode to swordfight, and that takes all the fun out of it.

The gunplay is mediocre. I've played much better on the PS2, and am spoiled by the GTA series to the point that I expect the aiming mechanism to be just as fluid and simple.

The graphics are surprisingly dated. Again, they're weak compared to the typical PS2 FPS. I don't really care about ""pretty"" graphics, but these are poor enough to deserve mention.

It could be that this game really needs a standard PS or XBox type controller, with lots of buttons and two joysticks. Too bad. It would be a fun game. I'm really looking forward to the Wii game where I can put down the shotguns, Uzis, and BFGs and just hack at a few bad guys with a sword.

My advice: Save your money and wait for something better."
37144,2,"This game is pretty bad, I used to be an MK fan until they released this garbage. Technically it's decent but it has no personality and the combo/fighting system is awkward. I actually rather play MK4 instead of this because at least that game had the spirit of the earlier games.

3D fighters have left this series in the dust, I much rather play Dead or Alive... any of them."
101627,2,Boring game
51255,2,"I honestly do not like cheat devices, but since Wild Arms 4 came out, it actually now has a use. Let me explain...

Unfortunately, thanks to an programming on the part of Xseed Puplishing (the company that translated Wild Arms 4) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device, or a similar device like a Gameshark. Since this is the cheapest of all said devices, if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game, you'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this.

If it wasn't for this reason, I wouldn't even be interested in this product."
172084,2,"Some things are just better off being left in 2-D.  Anyone familiar with the Castlevania series at all knows this to be fact, as Konami's attempts to bring the long running series to the realm of 3-D have just fallen flat.  Now we get a Castlevania fighting game (don't ask why) with Castlevania Judgment for the Wii, which even though it says it's a Castlevania game, is really a generic fighting game with little personality to it to seperate it from the rest of the pack.  There's a decent roster of fighters that Castlevania fans will recognize, such as Simon Belmont, Alucard, and even Dracula; but there isn't much variation or real differences between most of the fighters.  The fighting system appears to offer some depth, but it really isn't anything you haven't seen countless times before.  The game doesn't look too bad though, and there is some great music as well, but there just isn't enough here that helps the game stand out on its own.  All in all, Wii owners who are Castlevania fans and/or fighting game fans may want to give Castlevania Judgment a look, but other than that, your time is better off served elsewhere."
263069,2,The game to me is to hard to use with the normal play station control. It also could be that I am left handed.
211430,2,"Very disappointing - this is basically the Sims 2 with better graphics.  Nothing like the Sims 3 PC version, which I bought this to replace since the PC version crashes constantly.  EA continues to disappoint.  Maybe they should quit making console versions and focus on getting rid of the bugs in the PC version and making it run smoother and leaner."
143671,2,"I can't even believe how loud this machine is.  Very good games out for this console, but beware of watching a movie or listening to music - the machine's drive and fans are so loud!  The controllers are quite heavy, there is no bluetooth in them and they require 'AA' batteries.  Yes... batteries.  On a $440 console.  No wireless either, and no High Definition drive either.  Once you add the missing components the PS3 is a much better deal, runs silently, and looks much nicer.  Plus, most games are released on both consoles at the same time now so PS3 is the winner for me.  I honestly can't believe how loud this thing was... UNBELIEVABLE."
4778,2,"This controller is an okay replacement for the original SNES controllers, but not as good. The reason why this controller is not as good as the original SNES controllers is because the buttons are not as sensitive to button presses unlike the original which have very sensitive buttons; the buttons after using them for several months or a little bit more start to sink down more inside the controller because the springs are not as strong as the ones in the original controllers are. In addition, they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable, so they will not last as long. My recommendation is to not buy these controllers and get refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers on (...) or the exact replica version because they use the same exact materials to make those controllers as Nintendo does for their controllers. The only difference is the exact replica's do not have the Nintendo logo on it. I got two refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers from that website and they work excellently and they will last for many years. And another thing about the New Port controllers, the first time you use them, the D-Pad buttons are rather stiff and eventually lossen up after using them for a while and become easier to use. A last warning about the controller, the down function on the D-Pad does not work very good, unlike on the original Super Nintendo cotrollers, the down function on the D-Pad works excellently."

41882,2,"Pathetic and unworthy of the name ""Legend of Zelda.""

When I saw screenshots for this game prior to its release I was up in arms, as were many people, and ready to avoid this game like the plague. Unfortunately, many people seem (for some unknown reason) to have been won over by the game after its release; I, however, found the disappointment of playing this game to be exactly commensurate with my expectations.

I decided to give the game an honest chance; I thought, ""Just look at it as Ocarina of Time with different graphics and different levels."" Sadly, the only thing carried over from OoT were the horrible controls (funny how technology advances and Nintendo still can't manage to achieve correspondence between controller inputs and character actions; oh well...), though one could stretch a point and say that OoT did introduce gratuitously bizarre new elements to the Zelda world (the Goron race comes to mind), but TWW takes this to such an extreme that I cannot forgive it for its eccentricities as I did OoT.

TWW is boring and embarrassing. Boring because the story has virtually no connection to the prior Zelda games, so the hardcore fan really has to make a mental leap to even consider this as continuous with the other games. Boring also because the game starts out with sheer tedium; it took what seemed like forever to get the sword, only to lose it in the first level. And the game actually starts out with a Gerudo Fortress-like level where one must evade detection. One would think that Shiggy would start the game out with the most fun and pleasant puzzles he possibly could, to encourage immersion in the game before challenging the gamer's patience, but the worst trials of my patience came right at the beginning of the game.

The game is embarrassing because it is extremely immature in a way reminiscient of Majora's Mask. I'm not sure if it's just the way the Japanese design games, but the bizarre childish characters and graphics were very off-putting. While I'm on the subject, the graphics are terrible. There is no sense that this is a Zelda game; it's a cartoon. There is certainly no sense of darkness in the game either, something every Zelda game before this has had. The game is very lighthearted and giddy and yet tedious. Excellent combination for boring me to death.

I kept playing, hoping for a break to the boredom, but it never came. I stopped playing this game and have no intention of coming back to it. Adventure of Link was good enough as a game that I finished it, but this game is just terrible. Stay away unless you want to be a Miyamoto-barning fanboy."
11638,2,"I bought this so I can play some retro SNES games...the controller stopped working completely after a month.  Not sure what to make of that...It was a used controller, so I imagine something was wrong with it to begin with so this is really on the seller"
215142,2,I personally did not care for this one.  Does not work well with my controller even though I have it will synchronized.
123019,2,"not what i was expecting... the first Condemned was a pretty solid/decent game but this one was a little slow, boring and really repetitive! don't waste ur time buying this one.... its a let down"
395435,2,"Sorry, I just cant stand the future aspect of these last two COD games. The bright colors and all the robotic stuff is just a turn off for me. My 11 year old son loves it, I guess that is the aim for the developers. He is a squeaker for sure. He is good at it though. I will stick with BF4."
226640,2,"This is not Tropico 4 ... it is the same game as Tropico 3 with the same mechanics and the same graphics.  Sure, it's marketed as Tropico 4, but it's realistically Tropico 3 with 20 new missions and some new buildings.  The music lacks the life it used to have and sounds like generic elevator music you would find in a low-quality hotel in the Carribean.  The music before made me feel like I was on a beach out in the sunshine.  The new voice acting is horrible ... Juanito in Tropico 3 at least had some character.  Here, the voices are almost deadpan.

I'm still a fan, but this should have been labelled an expansion pack instead of shamelessly trying to sell it as a new game which it surely is not."

208295,2,"this is the best SWT:FU2 storyline is the best, but the worsts is the chapter level is too short i just got it today played and finish under 5-6hrs,"
7311,2,"This game falls short with so many other console fighting games. It has cool characters and stages,moves but not enough of these aspects to make the game shine. Thats exactly why I highly recommend the Sega CD game Eternal Champions:Challenge From The Darkside it has all the characters,moves,overkills that this 16 bit cart does and a whole lot more. In the Sega CD sequel the player has 4 brillant ways to end a match not just the one you get with the genesis game. The Sega CD version has overkills which is in this game ,but in addition has cinekills(a cinema scene where you brutally dispose of the opponent)Vendettas(where each character has a unique way to let out his/her revenge),and Sudden Deaths(another background finisher like overkills except they are harder to pull off and ends the round quicker)and tons of characters I believe 38-40 with not palette swaps like the ... Mortal Kombat series. BOTTOM LINE I GIVE ETERNAL CHAMPIONS CREDIT FOR BEING MADE TO SPAWN THE WONDERFUL SEGA CD GAME,WHICH I WOULD RECOMEND OVER THIS ANY DAY!"
299790,2,"This is a good game for a 6 or 7 year old, but much older and you'll be bored.  I played it for a few hours with my daughter - but it got so repetitive that we haven't picked it up since.

If you can get it for $9.99 or less, I recommend it, but I wouldn't pay more for it."
206979,2,"Others have written fair assessments of the game, which is lacking in many categories.

The worst of which is the ability to get around in the game without snagging something like a tree, rock, sidewalk, stairs, water - You can be swimming along and bam, run into a wall of water...ridiculous and definitely not an open playing field... Additionally the online gameplay is very disappointing since most people opt to play team deathmatch and that's not so fun for the rookie who comes in to be the target for those who have picked up on the game already.  That is, there appears to be very little skill filtering, so newbies get used badly.  So again, not so fun campaign and not so fun online = not so fun, I'd say pass/wait on this one...it'll drop in price quickly."
78050,2,"Read the other reviews to get a good idea of what you will be dealing with. It is definitely buggy...even with updates. I firmly believe a game should be fully functional out of the box. This game requires and will continue to require updates and patches. I have a pre-release copy because

I was a beta tester. I have played the retail release version for over 3 weeks.

Forget this game and go buy Elder Scrolls: Oblivion!!!

To be honest, if you want the best of both FPS and RPG environments...skip this game. The graphics are outdated, the concept is outdated and the inventory management system is horrible. Just wait till you have 2 or 3 characters to manage!!!! UTTERLY FRUSTRATING and TIME CONSUMING!!

If you like clicking around with your mouse all day....you could just cruise websites...it won't cost you a dime...or you could play this game!

Pass it over, especially if you played the first NWN game. Not much new folks.

Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is still the GOLD STANDARD!"
493779,2,The Game Is just fine. Gets boring very soon. At least for me.
409576,2,I have been playing since Gears day one.  I'm a level 144 and as of a couple weeks ago it is taking 5-15 minutes to find a match.  I don't know if its because of my level and its difficult yo find a match or if its because there aren't as many online players.  I don't know to much about the story mode as I skipped it.  It was fun and would have given a 4 or 5 but I'm getting to the point that I'm going to shelf it.  This is the on be game I enjoyed playing. :(
181090,2,"Covenant of the Plume is another one of those tactical RPGs that I just could not get into. I tried. I forced myself to sit down and play it. Ultimately, I just couldn't do it.

It's not that the game isn't necessarily put together poorly. It's laid out well, the graphics are decent, there are good tactical gameplay components, and there is a story in place. I just didn't get into it.

The story follows Wylfred, who seeks to get revenge on the ""reaper"" who claimed his father's soul after he fell in battle. Wylfred makes a pact with Queen Hel (i.e., pact with the devil) that allows him to use a plume that boosts the power of his allies, with the cost that the powered-up ally dies at the end of the battle.

So Wylfred goes to avenge his father by killing his friends along the way? Maybe it's intended to be poetic or a cautionary tale, but ultimately it just seemed stupid to me.

The gameplay itself is challenging, and there is a steep learning curve. I found the sin system to be problematic. This is a mechanic that involves gathering bloodlust for Queen Hel, called ""Sin"", which is obtained by inflicting damage on enemies that have already been drained of their HP. This mechanic dominates, because if you don't fulfill the sin requirement, you're basically forced to replay the battle. This, as you may suspect, gets frustrating after a while.

Unless you're a very hardcore fan of tactical RPGs, there are better games to spend your time and money on. I sort of picked this one up on a whim and just couldn't get into it."
483173,2,"I was excited to try this game. I'm not a fan of cheerleading, but I loved wii cheer. Well, this was not what I expected. The cheer's were extremely short and def. shorter than the already short, wii cheer. I felt just as I was getting into it, the cheer was done and it wasn't easy to learn."
301049,2,"I'm surprised at how bad this game is. I have been playing TES since Morrowind and I own every game in the series, but I really expected more. Skyrim is just a reskinned Oblivion. The textures look god-awful, even in 1900x1200. I honestly think that Oblivion with mods looks better than Skyrim, even with the HD(2k) texture pack. I know that modding these games is a full time job but I did that with Oblivion and I shouldn't have to mod a modern game to make it decent. When I heard that Zenimax(Bethesda's parent) bought Id I thought that they would get more ideas to improve TES engines but I guess that's not how these things work.

Interesting note: (Well it was to me) Don't be fooled by the case and disc, there is no physical PC version of this game. Once you activate it on Steam you can't give or sell it to anyone else, because it only has one key and that will be permanently linked to your Steam account. The only reason to get the disc version of this game is if you have a very slow internet connection and you just want the files handy. I haven't tried it but I'm fairly sure you should be able to activate a Steam game over dial-up.
The more you know*"
123800,2,"I didn't particularly like this controller upon receiving it.  It felt uncomfortable and bulky in my hand, the controls were slightly unresponsive, and the buttons took extra effort to depress compared to the standard  or Logitech Ps2 controllers.  From a tactile perspective, it just felt poor and muddled.

That being said, it did have a durable feel, and I felt that it could have been a nice, robust wireless controller for Role-playing games and other games that put fewer demands on responsiveness.  Until today, I'd have given this controller 3 stars.

However, just today, it broke on me.  The d-pad started becoming either unresponsive, or kept driving my character in an unintended direction.  This is a complete deal-breaker for me as the controller only experienced light use.

I could go on, but ultimately, my recommendation is simply not to buy this controller.  It may seem like a more robust alternative to the logitech controller, but the logitech controller is simply better."
484140,2,I did not like the games at all
32112,2,"Excellent graphics, fast cars.  Problem, I spin out often.  I have been racing NASCAR for 2 years and I have won several championships.  I have been trying to play this game but it won't let me.  I have practiced and practiced to no avail.  I have read the book over and over.  Yet, at any time, any lap, I spin towards the left.  You spin out, go against the wall and that is where you stay.  I usually have post position 1 and I am usually ahead and for no reason, even though I glide into the curve and speed up slowly I still spin out.  You are against the wall and you can only wait for all cars to go by.  From 1st to 43 on one spin.  2003 does not do this.  Computer cars are too agressive.  Yes , they have great crashes, I don't want to crash, I want to win. I am selling my 2004 and 2002.  My fantasy.  Too real for me."
87111,2,"I played this game all the way through and honestly it was confusing disjointed and it did not seem like your actions on Earth (Midgard) had any affect on the fighters available in Asgard. Graphics were great, but really that is my only reason for not giving it 1 star."
56438,2,"Did you ever play Front Mission 3?
If you have, you probably know what a great game that was. It had everything you could hope for from an RPG. A riviting story, excellent music, likeable characters and a fun, well-paced battle system. On its own, Front Mission 4 isn't a bad game, but compared to the last one, it is a let down of epic proportions.

One thing you'll notice immediately while playing Front Mission 4 is that it doesn't have the internet mode in Front Mission 3, where you surf fictional websites in the complex, fictional world. Since I didn't like the internet system too much it wasn't that big a deal for me. However, I will say that it did flesh out the world it took place in and made it more believable. Some people may be dissapointed that this wasn't included in 4.

Another thing is that the music in this game is incredibly bland. FM 3 had terrific music but FM4 has only elevator music.

The story isn't as compelling either but I mostly blame this on the bland character development. They were not three-dimesional and sometimes they only came off as stereo-types. One thing I couldn't get over was one of the main villians, a genetically enhanced super-human (like the Imaginary Numbers from FM3)named Wagner who always reacts with wide-eyed astonishment whenever you beat him a fight. He always says something like ""what is it that makes you so strong?"" Uh...hello? Subtlety? Not in this game. Gone are the days when subtle, philosophical build up spanned the length of a game to reveal in a grand climax the true strength of the human spirit; they just decided to say, ""look! Human spirit trumps all! We don't even have to explain why!""
F-ing lame...

The only good thing about this game is the much improved battle-system. It puts much more emphasis on team work, allowing characters to attack simoltaneously when grouped together in a small squad. Also, each character has their own signature moves and abilities which can be aquired by spending earned skill points. To me, this works much better than the way you learned skills in FM3 from using different Wanzers, which always seemed weird to me. Missle launchers aren't just limited to six missles fired one at a time anymore. They can shoot more missiles, sometimes fired in groups. For example, a missle rack has 4x4 ammo. This means it can hit a target with four missles at once and can be done four times before you have to reload. 2x8, likewise, means you can fire 8 times and each time attack with 2 missles at once.

The battle system is great...but it is killed by massive terrain which must often be treked across making some battle last as long as an hour. This gets boring and tedious very fast. Also, skill points are incredibly hard to gain.

Front Mission 4 is an inferior remake and if I was you, I'd stick to 3."
318111,2,"It does look well but the sound is horrible. The guns sound like they have low resolution and muffled. I was excited for it, now I wonder what Mankind Divided will be like."
139071,2,"Sometimes when they make the next game in a series it doesn't resemble anything like the previous game in the series. Well with Diablo III you don't have to worry about it the game looks exactly like Diablo 2 in fact you could probably call this Diablo 2.1. Eleven years after Diablo 2 comes out and they haven't made hardly any changes that you can you tell, I'm not sure what they were thinking. Here are my observations of the game. First the biggest thing is to play single player you have to play online through Battle Net. This has to be the dumbest idea they could have come up with.  I had problems getting my account setup since I hadn't played Battle Net in about 10 years so I didn't remember my password and the other information to reset it. It took several hours to get the download and get my account straightened out. I was fortunate and didn't have any problems getting into Battle Net once I had my account setup.  I did have problems once I got on; I got kicked out of Battle Net 3 times during the game. Once after a major Boss Fight and I lost all of the treasure, which really made me mad. There is a lot of server lag where you are in a fight and one second you are toe to toe fighting it out and the next you're on the other side of the screen, so disappointing.
  The game took me about 25 hours to complete with a level 31 Barbarian. The graphics and music are pretty much the same as Diablo 2 and you still have this far away camera angle and you can't zoom in to your character. I guess it really doesn't matter since you can't really customize your character you're stuck with one of five premade character classes all with a male or female option. You would think after 11 years you would be able to customize what your character looks like hair color and style and facial hair or not, nope they made them for you and sometime they are just ugly. You would think if you play with friends you could get confused on which is your character.
  Like I said there is nothing new in the game I did notice that they removed the matched armor sets that if you got the entire set it would give you a bonus. The game just got tedious after a while and I had to force myself to complete the game. In fact the only thing I really liked was the cut scenes the animation is just mind blowing they look so good. The game isn't bad but it's not good either and with having to play a solo game online does move it to bad game. The whole DRM thing is just stupid; it's like putting a sophisticated alarm system on a Yugo."
97647,2,"TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) is the videogame tie-in for the TMNT movie released in March 2007. ""Ultimately, the movie seems driven more by the need to keep a toy line and franchise alive than any creative inspiration"" says Kirk Honeycutt from the Hollywood Reporter. Unfortunately the same is true for the videogame. TMNT can be summarized by: running, jumping and occasionally fighting several (identical) bad-guys. The game does not require any puzzle-solving or brain activity to speak of. We were able to complete the Xbox360 version of the game in about 6 hours, which was largely do to the easy difficulty and unlimited lives. TMNT only offers single player mode with no Multiplayer what-so-ever. The game may appeal to children because of its easy difficulty and famous characters, but unless you have unlimited or free game rentals, TMNT is not worth your time or money. On a positive note: TMNT will provide the easiest 900 points for our Xbox360 Gamerscore ever."
452001,2,"As a huge fan of parts # 1 & 2, I had high expectations.  Granted, game play is with much the same physics model & powerups.  There are plenty of new cars available, with a smattering of the good, old cars, too. Curiously absent is `Die Anna' and her car.  You MUST play as the character Max Damage.
  But the sticking point for me is the peds in part # 3, they're hostile.  No bikini girls & grandmas here.  More like crazed green mutants wielding lengths of pipe who'll attack en masse and pound you on the fender until you're toast...just try stopping your vehicle in the midst of a group of crazed lead-pipe hooligans, you'll see!
TDR was coded in Australia, and there's an ""ozzie"" level where you can run down 'roos in ""Mad"" Max Rakatanski's MVP interceptor or Humongous's custom ride from Road Warrior.  There's a Thunderdome of sorts, and a Bartertown, as well.  Z.Z.Top seem to be driving one monster truck. These little touches are nice, but the lack of innocent peds screaming & pleading in terror, as in parts # 1 & 2, is too great to overcome.  The peds in TDR hurl epithets about your mama's sexual history along with their molotovs.  Bring back the grannies with walkers !"

373876,2,"The original Blackwidow Chroma is a not so great keyboard. I got this as a Christmas present in 2016 and it lasted until around May 2017.

When the keyboard DID work, it worked pretty well. The lighting was good, the software was buggy as hell, and the switches felt good enough.

Okay, so going over the design it looks just like your average 2014 Blackwidow until you plug it in. One design change in the Chroma is the WHITE backplate instead of a green one, and that's so all the colors pop. You have 5 additional macro keys which are very nice to have, as well as a USB pass through and input jacks for a 3.5 MM mic and headphones. Nice job on thinking outside the box Razer. HOWEVER, this keyboard is made of a plastic that is a GREASE MAGNET. When I took it out of the box, it already had at least 5 finger prints on it from me picking it up. Overall, the design gets a B-.

The key switches. This keyboard uses the FIRST GENERATION Razer Green switches, made by a switch manufacturer named ""Kailh"" and these switches were not that great, and we can't be surprised by that because all other Kailh switches are crap. The Blackwidow Ultimate 2014 and the Blackwidow Chroma (And Chroma TE) had issues with some keys not being as clicky as others, as well as registering twice on one key stroke. Personally, I never had these issues BUT they felt VERY MUSHY.

HOWEVER, despite feeling mushy, they were very responsive and were actually a bit quieter, due to the mush. But still, a mechanical keyboard isn't suppose to be feel mushy. Luckily, Razer ditched Kailh and switched to Greetech in spring of 2016, Greetech switches have MUCH higher quality and feel a lot better. No mush to them at all. This keyboard here did get updated with the Greetech switch, but its pretty rare to find one. Overall, the switches get a D-.

What about the software? This keyboard runs on Synapse 2.0, I'm not sure if it will be updated to support Synapse 3.0 or not, but I highly doubt it. At the time when I had this keyboard (Late 2016 - Early 2017) Synapse was very buggy. Sometimes lighting effects wouldn't change or work right, it crashed a lot, it was a nightmare. Luckily a few updates in Summer of 2017 fixed all my issues, made my Deathadder perform a bit better too. Software gets a C.

Now for the icing on the cake, the lighting. The lighting is very nice. This keyboard features a white backplate while the Blackwidow Ultimate 2014 features a green backplate. The Chroma model has a white backplate to allow ALL the colors to look vibrant. If they would have used a green backplate, all the colors but green would look ""off."" The lighting is controlled through Razer Synapse, which allows for a few preset lighting effects, or you can create your own. Lighting gets an A+.

Would I recommend this keyboard? Honestly, no. If you want a Razer Chroma keyboard, get the Blackwidow X Chroma or the Blackwidow Chroma V2. You get upgraded LED's, as well as the new Greetech switches."

450194,2,"My biggest complaint about this game is the totally abysmal mouse movement. I found myself wanting to throw it at the screen, so lousy is the navigation. This game is the winner of the worst navigation plan ever conceived. I give it the Golden  Blind Mice Award, only given to games that cannot figure out how to illustrate to the player any visual clues to where they are supposed to go without a cane. Even with one, you will be ""tapping"" your mouse so frequently without any results that you might as well put on tap shoes and dance across the keyboard waiting for something to happen. The PDA console takes up too much of the screen, the inventory methods are sloppy. This is an awful game."
444226,2,"I've played for about 5 hours, most of that in the Character Creator and hating the experience.  I'm the type of person that loves the character editor and can spend a stupid amount of time in it, making new characters I might not even play as. And the character editor is horrible, now before release Bioware kept saying that it would be like Dragon Age Inquisition, One of the best editors on the market.  So i was super pumped just to play around with that... and what it turns out to be is 9 preset face of each gender that are all hideous, that you have only the slightest input in actually altering.  Mostly its just their eye position, and nose size, not type of eye shape, mouth shape or nose shape.

They are designed this way so you (a twin) can have your twin and father look like you are in the same family racially, but there is nothing stopping you from making one twin Asian and the other twin black.  which is what i did in my game, and the father (which is generated based on your main character profile I think) came out kind of middle eastern looking.  neat effect?  But why is it locked within the preset profiles to make such a boring effect. Without giving away a spoiler it literally doesn't matter after a hour into the game that your character looks like your father.  Cause lets just say, they tend to wear helmets a lot and bad things happen.

Furthermore, each preset has a definite age, skin texture, eye shape, nose shape, and coloring that comes along with that preset that can't be changed at all.  and I'm not taking about skin tone, one girl has a red pointy turned up nose, like shes perpetually a little drunk (or British).  One woman looks like she's 50, deep lines on her face.  One of the man looks like he's never evolved past being a neanderthal, and none of this can be changed at all.  Not at all, point red nose girl will always have a pointy red nose, old lady will always be old, young man with freckles will always be the only one of his kind with freckles, the placement, and sizer of eyes, nose, and chin are the only thing you can change.  It is literally the most disappointing part of the whole thing.

Hair for whatever reason is locked to each gender, also with about 9 presets each gender and seems to be a wig rather then actually come out of the character head. also the hair color is the same as the facial hair color though the eye brows never changed.  In past games all of these were individually controllable, cause blonde beards always look like someone put shaving cream on and forgot to shave in these games.

The only thing that seems to have any controllable is the make up color and and tattoo color, which is on a slider.  Considering I'm terrible at putting on make up in the first place, I gave up and made my dude look like a very fabulous drag queen and the girl like she's from an old 80's metal band.

Now when it comes to gameplay, again I've played up till the first main plot point, I can't say much other then... it took 600 years in cryosleep to get there how are the surprised aliens got there first. Seriously!  You don't have legion operating these ships to make sure their decision to go that far isn't wasted... apparently not.

Rumor has it they might update the creator with a patch, but until I'm not backlogged with better games like Horizon Zero Dawn and Nier, I'll probably wait to play it again when I have time or hopefully they Patch it.  Since the games release on Tuesday it's had 4 patches, what's a few more to make they game feel less like a beta game launch.  If i didn't get the game for 15$ i would have canceled my pre-order... still wishing i did and used the money on something better."
205552,2,This game did not meet my expectations. The soundtrack in this Midnight Club is worse compared to Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition Remix. I thought there would be more maps. This game gets boring really quick. I played all of the Midnight Club Racing games and I can easily say that this one is the worst.
13811,2,"Considering how bad the first one was I didn't expect its sequel to be any different.  It wasn't combines the worst of all worlds, chessy soudtrack, chessy graphics and a missions operations manual that defifes all logic and reason."
99082,2,"I have already bought the PC collection edition so maybe that will be better on the PC. I'll first tell you overall how I felt the game was before I got stuck. It's a bit cheesy. Not Japanese anime RPG cheesy, but ""Oh, I get a staff, yippee!"" cheesy. The melee system is pretty bad. Other reviewers bash Oblivion for having repetitive combat? Yes, that's repetitive but this is really bad. Block attack, bash and kick them. Wait for your stamina to go up while you block again, then bash and kick them again. Repeat 20-40 times per enemy. This is 1990's RPG-level melee. The lightining indoors is horrible, and yes, you have infravision, but that just makes everything distorted and uneven light texture. I think that in trying to make the game different than Oblivion, they ended up with quirks that do NOT contribute positively to the game. They just should have made a solid, easy to play game, no matter what the management and polls suggested. I don't like the combat, spell system, and inventory system in general; not horrible but certainly not easy to use when you need to use it. Anyway, I got stuck on Chapter 2, inside the one building that connects to the Necromancer's gate. Two different walkthroughs told me to go to the door at the top of the left-hand stair and open it. Guess what, it has a red jammed key in it and will not open. So I go back a few saves and look at the door. Still locked. Will not open. No Chapter 3 for me. No finishing the game. Maybe you will get a game that doesn't have this glitch, maybe not. Now that I'm thinking about it, let me put on X-Box live and see if there are any online patches. Still though, this is ridiculous that there is a terrible glitch in the first few hours of gameplay..."

254356,2,"Update 4-aug-2013.  Downgrading dramatically.

After having lived with this for a while I have to downgrade my original review dramatically.  What I said below is still true, but there are things that have plagued my gameplay from the beginning and are just too great a problem for me to do what I want.

1. Most and foremost is character development.  I have never got around the issue of how advancement works.  Because of the way abilities and skills are linked, how you create a character makes no sense.  The game's basic design is one which almost requires you to create a ""balanced"" character in order to achieve a ""fully developed"" character.  This just makes little sense to me, and I guess never will.  I can't say that it is a bad character development design, only that I can't figure out why it was necessary.  For example, if you want to be a magic wielder it would make sense that you max out your magic abilities.  But not so in this game.  To do this would be to create a character that will get trampled later in the game wholesale.  You would think that developing any skill would be a good thing.  But the way character upgrade works in this game it is actually bad because you cannot develop too much at one time or you miss opportunity to advance.  This is just way too frustrating for me.

2. Spell casting is still hard to control.  I would prefer right mouse click but I am stuck with a key choice (default is C).  So it is hard to get used to this given other games that let me do spells via mouse.  It has remained very difficult to cast.  Additionally spells are not seeking which means they almost never hit an enemy that moves which makes many spells useless most of the time.

3. Still don't like the fact that I cannot summon more than one creature at a time.

So from a perspective gain from long term, I am downgrading two points.

Hail Flavius!

This game has a lot to recommend it, but at the same time is troubling is several ways, most notably, figuring out how to play it.

Pros:

Long.  If you like long, then there is lots here for you.

Continues the saga.  If you are a fan of the series then this is more of what you know and want.

** Spell Creation.  Maybe the most exciting thing for me in this game is the ability to create spells.  Though not without its flaws (how do you delete a spell from your inventory if you don't want it anymore?), creation of spells is for me where this game really has the potential to shine.  If you are creative and understand the game's mechanics, you can do great stuff.  There is even a web page of ""Useful Spells"" where other players have given examples that show things like: how to get your horse to walk on water, and how to travel twice as fast, and jump twice as high, and how to create combos that destroy whole rooms of creatures.  But... to make this work you have to actually understand how the spells work behind the scenes and there is no guide for this I can find.

Cons:

** the first and biggest issue I have with the game is knowledge.  There is no real guide that describes how stuff works.  For example, how would you know that paralyze causes the target to fall over even if the spell is for only 1 second.  You don't see this as any kind of help info so you can't research it in the game to find out, yet many awesome spells take advantage of spell effects that occur even when the spell is created as a 1 second spell.  Thus the novice will never be able to create great spell combos and misses out on this most awesome and distinguishing feature of the game.

No area of effect spells?  Well, not really true.  Most spells can I guess be created with any area of effect you want.  But as a novice player I could not figure out how area of effect works.  It is not obvious that there is anything like area of effect spells in the game that I have so far found.  For example, where is your typical ""Meteor Storm"" spell or ""Noxious Gas"" spell?  Other games have such spells and the visual seen when you cast the spell in those games makes it clear there is an area of effect involved.  Not so in Oblivion 4.  Until last night I never knew there was anything like area of effect for a spell.

Leveling Up is Confusing.  Leveling up is reasonably straight forward is some ways.  But as you read about the game online to try and improve your gameplay, you are confronted with the realization that you have to choose between playing the game for fun, of spending lots of time trying to perfect your level ups to gain best advantage.  For an example, read up on ""EFFICIENT LEVELING"" in Oblivion 4.  And this leads to my final con.

Feel like I am missing out.  The ""Efficient Leveling"" concept highlights my biggest gripe, that I fell like no matter what I do, I have created a flawed character.  This in turn takes a lot of the fun out of it for me.  Now this may be my own issue in fairness, there are many things the game does to overcome this.  The magnitude of the game overall is one great example.  This game offers so many quests that you can't possibly do them all.  This is great, as long as you can get past the fact that you will not be able to do all quests and thus will miss many.  Same is true for character creation, lots of options but pick a bad combination and you have no hope of creating a high level character without flaws.  Of course, the other side of this issue is that it is often the most flawed character types that are the most fun to play in many games but I don't see that yet in this game.

Can't summon multiple creatures.  Gee, I spent all that time getting my magicka up so that I could summon and now get only one creature at a time???

Final thoughts:

Overall it is a great game.  And I suppose every negative I have has two sides.  You can play the game as a novice and have fun, or you can play as an expert and really tweak the crap out of it with your character if you know how.  In this respect I guess the game is great because it is one of the few games where both old players and new players can enjoy it in different ways thus it accomplishes something that few games do which is give new players a fun game and give old players of the series more material to work with.

But I have to say, the lack of an online or downloadable guide that has the detail needed to truly exploit the game's features is a real minus for me.  This game is so deep in certain ways that you almost need to be schooled in it before you play it.  I heard that some Colleges and Universities were offering classes in how to play certain computer games.  Wonder if there is one for Oblivion 4?

Hail Flavius!"
150133,2,"Honestly I went back to playing to playing Red Dead Redemption which i first thought had silly characters.  But after playing Mafia 2, I realized I much preferred Red Dead Redemption because there was a lot more to do in the Western cities, side missions, or just go around and creating some chaos.  Mafia 2 has beautiful graphics, a great looking city, pretty nice looking cars that drive pretty good, and a promising storyline.  But the whole environment is pretty baron.  The thing I loved about the first Mafia on PC was the open environment, the crazy cop chases, shoot outs with the bad guys in the streets, and in their black cars.  That to me was a great game in itself.  I even like the cop interaction better than in GTA.  But in Mafia 2, there isn't anything to do.  The cop chases are not interesting, there is no free mode or shootouts or side missions to do.  And that only leaves the missions which to me became boring because I don't like the control mechanisms and the straight forward linear shooting.  They seemed to take a big step backward in that regard.  On the other hand I love the Dead Aim shooting on RDR, push down the right stick, slow motion, and dead aim 5-6 shots to the head, torso, even when riding a horse and the other guy is riding fast to catch you.  Sorry I keep comparing, these two games are the two big open environment games of the year and one secedes and the other fails.  Mafia 2 still has potential, if they took the great graphics, the AI, all the technology, the city, and reworked  it into a funner open end game with more things to do, better shooting mechanics, better free mode, and put the elements BACK into the sequel that made the original so great!"

159393,2,"I'm very disappointed. I like the idea of the traits system, but this game just doesn't look good and isn't fun. The more I play it, the less I like it, and that certainly wasn't true of Sims 2.

The graphics in Sims 2 were such a delight. The Sims 3 is just terrible. The sun seems so harsh that everyone seems to have dark smudges on their faces. I actually removed all blush so they wouldn't look quite so ghastly. A lot of the animations are swiped from Sims 2, but I didn't see one single new animation that amused me.

Lots of things just don't make sense. Why are the Sims running everywhere? It's supposed to be a life simulation. Most people don't run everywhere they go. In Sims 2, you couldn't leave kids alone at home. Now you can, and they also ride their bikes in traffic anywhere they want to go. Um... this is a life simulation?

A lot of things have been simplified and/or made more complex for no apparent reason. You get to see why babies are crying now, but it's actually easier to care for them -- no more going to the fridge for a bottle. So what was the point of the change? It didn't add to gameplay.

I could go on, but basically: This game is dumbed down. Personally I like the reorganization of Buy mode, and create-a-sim in Sims 3 is fun (although so many options are hidden that you forget that you can select their voices or favorite colors till it's too late). The idea of letting you play only one household is a total disaster. Sims 2 is an extreme high point in complex gaming. Sims 3 is a ""casual"" game for impatient people who didn't like Sims 2. Beware."
188168,2,Mass Effect 2 lacks what I loved in the first Mass effect. Driving around on a planet with my vehicle. So far I've played the 2nd game about 8 hours and theres no love. It's  one of the reasons I bought the second and am very let down. That fact really bugged me and then the second thing that bugged me was the load times. Going from one floor to another in Normandy is annoying and would have been better if they stuck with the elevators. At least you can listen to the elevator music or the news. The Graphics are excellent and probably the big factor in load times. So if you have patients and can take the extra time to get the controls down and wait on loading then this games for you. But then again I might have better judgement after I finish it...

51229,2,"ok so i knew it was like baldur's gate, but unfortunately it's worse!  it gives you too many options to deal with items, customizations and whatnot, and not enough fun action.  i was really hoping a big problem with baldur's gate (aiming arrows) would be fixed, but nope!  it wasn't.  in fact, the problem was worse.  screw this game."
70717,2,"The first day I played ""Animal Crossing: Wild World"", I thought it was the most boring game I had ever played. The game was being given such great reviews that I wanted to know what I was missing out on and it turned out that it wasn't much. Since the game runs on real time, it can be quite boring. Finding all the bugs and fish is a huge hassle that takes about a year because some (or most) only appear during certain months.

After continuing to play for about a week, I found it was entertaining to collect the fish and bugs and to run errands for bells to upgrade the house. But it gets old fast.

There's a lot of emphasis placed on fashion and design, what with designing your own clothes for the animals to wear and buying furniture to make the house look nice and receiving points for the way one arranges the furniture.

Also, I agree that the mole named ""Resetti"" is an extremely rude character. I had not seen the mole until I decided to reset on purpose a few times because people were commenting on how overboard he goes- and I must say I agree. Why that character was included in this supposedly ""children's game"" is beyond my comprehension. ""Resetti"" could most definitely hurt a child's feelings with what he says and what he makes them type."
161015,2,"What can I say that others haven't said? Nothing much, but F.E.A.R. 2 is a let down, and it's supposed to be a sequel. I was insulted on how dumbed-down the graphics, the gameplay and enemy AIs were. The graphics are what really ticked me off, although the original F.E.A.R. was not visually the best, but it was great for a 2005 game -- I managed to get 180fps on average with maxed settings, while F.E.A.R. 2 with it's watered downed graphics(also maxed out), I was locked at 60fps (without vsync). My specs are nowhere near high end, but I was surprised at this 60fps cap. If you played the first game, you can visually tell that F.E.A.R 2 is graphically inferior to that of the first game. Two other things that threw me off was the lack of mouse button support -- talk about a console port. A PC game made in 2009 does not support more than 3 mouse buttons!? Yes, F.E.A.R. 2 does NOT recognize your mouse's side buttons; If you want to program those buttons, you have to use 3rd party software to do so. Also there are no more quick saves, yup -- another step backwards. Your progress is saved via checkpoints.

Gameplay was disappointing as well. Leaning was completely removed; and of course they added the console ""cover system"", which doesn't help at all and I never once used. Story was surprisingly short. I was able to beat the game in under 8 hours without rushing the game. The scares weren't also that great, I was expecting some good ones, but was disappointed. As for multi-player, I wasn't able to play since I didn't want to make a GameSpy account.

Overall, F.E.A.R. 2 was not the game I was hoping for. It seems today, every FPS is a console port. I was hoping this wasn't a port, but it turned out to be with everything to the visuals to the gameplay, even the littlest thing was completely revamped for console systems. I don't recommend the game if you love F.E.A.R. and its expansion packs, this game is nothing like them. I give this game 2/5 stars; I saved it from the 1 start of death mainly because it's not one of the worst games I've played, but definitely one of my least favorite games."
7450,2,"If you think that this is a good game then you seriously need your head examined

I can honestly say I've yet to play a good Spider-Man game. For all the hype, good reviews and people willing to pay the big bucks over this one, I thought it was sure to be the best. How disappointed I was to discover it's one of the blandest and boring beat-em-ups ever.

You begin playing as Spidey (but can later change to Venom if you wish) and you go about tiresome duties beating up generic thugs on the streets of Manhattan. Every thug looks the same and you'll end up punching to death the same guy a billion times (more so for those infuriating end of level bosses). The crap music is the same on every level. Apparently the game has 'additional music' by some band called Green Jelly, who I have never heard of. I assume they must be some none-hit wonder grunge band from Seattle back when all that was new. And quite what exactly they contributed to the game is a mystery as there are only 2 tracks in total (level music and boss music).

There is some plot going on but I couldn't follow it. The comic-book cut -scenes look terrible and the writing is too small to read. Plus the are very slow and add too much time between the boring levels.

The controls and gameplay are dire. There's no fluent movement or grace in the fighting. It's all just an annoying mess and terribly programmed. If you can bear to stay with the game until level 2 you'll know what I mean. It was so rage-inducing I almost gritted my teeth into dust and chucked the controls into the TV.

Stay well away from this horrible game. As a beat-em-up it stinks. As a Spidey game it stinks. It just plain reeks overall.

364833,2,This is an update to my Xbox One review so of you want to see an in depth review go to that one. Now the PC version is a console port done very poorly since nether realm outsourced it to another studio. The frame rate is inconsistent and the online is laggy. There rolling out patches but there are still problems. While the PC version looks the best it's only a very small slight edge over consoles which are superior due to being actually well made. Not bagging on PC cause PC is awesome but for some reason nether realm refuses to port the game themselves. Why? Idk. Recommendation wait til it gets fixed then get the game on G2A or on a steam sale
37753,2,"I have never played #2 or #3, but from what I've read and heard, they have all the parts of this game that I didn't like amplified. I originally rented this years ago in a quest for a new platform in between Spyros. It was kind of cute, but everything just seemed dull and repetitive. No puzzles, missions, or anything. Just firing at enemies. Eventually I got to an area where I couldn't find the way through, passed the controller on."
285045,2,"Has a very cheap toy feel to it.  Keep in mind this is more of a charger and it doesn't even charge the wii u game pad up to full. This isn't a defect. Which is very disappointing. It also makes holding the game pad uncomfortable with the added weight and bulk. The kick stand is flimsy and weak but at least it makes it more useful. Despite my complaints Nyko still has good customer service, I just wish they would add a money back guarantee if your not happy with the product for X amount of days."
217171,2,"Just arrived, but seems pretty buggy in the interface.  All the other games have no problems showing the ""hand cursor"" so you know where your are in relationship to the buttons to press.  This game seems to have them about half the time.  The other half, there's a button, and moving your arm around with no guidance on the screen, it's a hit and miss trying to orient exactly where the system thinks your hand is so you can guess which way to move it to hit the button.

Happens every time we play.

Game controls are more of a pain than anything else as well, and this is by far the least responsive Kinect game of all the ones I've got so far.

Doing the skiing is pretty impossible, as it just can't seem to correctly see my movements nor my sons.  So frustration ensues and the game gets put away in favor of the ones that play well.

The kendo game seemed like it would be pretty cool, but that's another with not great body movements for control, and another instance where you can do things and the character just sits there on screen, no input being taken in by the system.

It could be a decent game, but they're going to have to put out some patches first to make it actually playable before it becomes enjoyable."
120782,2,"(UPDATED FEBRUARY 19. 2012) This Thrustmaster Ferrari 5-in-1 wheel was my second try at getting going on computer racing. The Genius wheel had not worked (except for vibrating), but using the Thrustmaster, I was able to get rolling. However, the ""up"" shifter has broken after two months (my earlier review had expressed uncertainty on the durability). The wheel has accurate steering on the GTR Evolution game I purchased from Amazon (recommended). After logging in around 30 hours of racing, the up shifter broke. I have now switched the up gear shifting to a button, which is a little awkward to reach while trying to shift quickly. The wheel was not compatible with Need for Speed: Shift that I also ordered.  Even after adjusting the steering sensitivity to 100%, the best the Shift game would do was to have the car zig/zag slowly on the track--get GTR Evolution. I tried to treat the wheel gently, within reason, and the shifter still broke. Thrustmaster says it has a two year warranty. I haven't sent it back yet to check out the coverage. Since I prefer appliances that don't break, I have now purchased a used Logitech wheel advertised as ""like new."" I'll see how that goes."
396576,2,"I have not even played the game yet, but feel compelled to write a review solely based on the delivery method of this game for PC users.  Although I understand that most applications are shifting to download method versus CD/DVD/BluRay, the fact is that it should be discounted when compared to the console versions that do come with a disc.  Why should I have to pay the same price just to receive an empty box with a download code, and then use my internet connection/time to download it?  Not to mention that if something should happen to my computer, I have no disc to reinstall.  Yes, if it happens anytime soon I can probably reinstall it by downloading it again (more time), but what happens in the distant future when I want to reinstall this game and it's no longer available to download?  And why is only the PC version a download code?  The consoles can all download full games as well -- why pick on/cheat just the PC gamers?

I'm hoping this game lives up to the previous version which I enjoyed so well.  If it does, I may come back and adjust my rating appropriately, but I don't think I can ever give this game (no matter how good it may be) a full 5-star rating with this whole download-only thing just for PC gamers."
81660,2,"First off, let me state that I did not purchase the standard retail version of this game.  I had heard all about the retarded DRM scheme guaranteed to piss off paying customers while not affecting pirates in the slightest.  I was determined to avoid this at all costs and I did.

When EA announced it would allow Spore to be bought on Steam using only Steam as the DRM I found that acceptable, and they discounted the price so I got a much cheaper and better deal than if I had gone to a retail store.

I've installed it and played the game a bit and it IS fun... but only for a while, and then it's just old.  The game as promised back in late 2005/early 2006 was an exciting game concept that would allow you to create a creature, have it evolve and your abilities would depend on how you evolved it.  The end result is a simplistic mini-game collection that's loosely related to each other.

The Cell stage is fun, but it's over in 10 minutes or less...That's good though because there really isn't much to do in the cell stage but eat or be eaten, and to collect parts.  Speaking of Parts, there's only 3 kinds of mouths, 3 kinds of weapons, 3 kinds of eyes and 3 kinds of movement appendages.  12 pieces to get in total.

You start out as a herbivore or a carnivore.  If you want the ability to eat both, you either have to kill a cell with the omnivore mouth part, or you have to put two mouths on your creature (one carnivore and one herbivore).

After you have grown a certain number of times, it tells you that you've grown a brain and it's time to move to land.  You get 3 choices of feet to add, and you only have enough points to add one pair of legs at this point, so everyone pretty much looks so much like the same damn creature, I say to them ""You want Ice cream cone?"" and they all say yes.

During each phase you're presented with a short tutorial on the movement keys and other simple tasks, but annoyingly enough, these have never gone away for me... YES I KNOW, press the middle mouse button or the left and right buttons together to move the camera.  You don't have to tell me every damn time I play the game, but you do anyway. :(

EDIT: I have discovered that you CAN shut the tutorials off...I expected it would play once or twice and then stop, but instead it's an option in a menu I didn't see.

So anyway, after the cell phase it tells you what you are by your actions, herbivore if you ate mostly plants, carnivore if you ate mostly meat, and omnivore if you mixed it up...BUT if you just change your mouth part before you go to land, it doesn't matter WHAT the game said you were as a cell.  Also based on your food type you earn a special ability for the next phase. This isn't changeable so it might be worth figuring out what the bonuses are before you play so you can aim for the right diet.

The game only lets you have the mouth parts that you are supposed to have for each type, and you only get 3 basic types of mouths to start with in each type.  If you try to eat meat as a herbivore or plants as a carnivore, it'll make your creature vomit and tell you you can't do that.  However, if you have the omnivore part from the cell stage still on your creature, you can eat both no matter what.

After a while of scrounging for skeletons (which glow so you can't miss it) so you can earn new parts, or killing alpha creatures in other types, you can edit your creature.  Unfortunately there's no penalty for selling off everything on your creature, so you can totally rebuild your creature from scratch every time you mate.  Evolutions? I don't think so.

There are a few bonuses like ""epic creatures"" that you can kill (or more likely be killed by), and some rogue creatures that give you a big bonus in points if you befriend or kill it, but for the most part, you start off in the neighborhood of puny 10hp monsters, work your way up to the 30hp monsters, and then the 50hp monsters.

Like others have said, the creature creation is 80% cosmetic and only 20% of it is about function.  If you give your character 8 legs, the only difference is that you spent more points and he walks funny.  You could put one leg on him and he'd be just as fast and you'd have more points for weapons and stuff that allowed your creature to be social.

After you've befriended or extincted enough other creatures you'd have a grand total of maybe 1500 points to spend in the creature creator one last time before you went to the tribal stage.  At this point, most of the stats that were important in creature stage are irrelevant in tribal, so you might as well remake your creature to look the way you want.

Tribal stage bills itself as a sort of ""RTS"" mode, but it does so very poorly.  The crappiest RTS game is better than this.  Based on your performance in the cell stage and in the creature stage, you're awarded extra abilities in tribal.  Now you have two abilities, like for example as a herbivore you can call a ""refreshing rain"" to help make the plants grow more fruit, and as a social character in creature stage, you earn the ability to shoot fireworks to temporarily impress other tribes.

So you hurry up and beat the other 5 or 6 tribes into a pulp (I don't remember) or befriend them and you gain their tools as you do, which in turn helps you beat the next tribe.  After that you go to the civilization stage.  This is where it gets really boring for me.

Now based on the way you reacted, the game classifies you as either a fighter, a trader or a religious type, and you get abilities from that as well.  Fighters get to attack other cities, traders set up trade routes, and religious types have to convert cities.

This is NOTHING like civilization though.  It's like another RTS only this one is more boring.  It's even worse because as fun as it is to design a creature, it's boring as hell to design a house or a vehicle or whatever.  Unlike the other creator tools, I felt like this was a chore and I didn't want to spend too much time working to make the building look really cool because ultimately it was 100% cosmetic.  Nothing you did had any real effect.

Vehicles were slightly different, because each piece would either add to your attack power, health, or speed... but now the ratio of each part to the others is what determines how good your vehicle is.  Again, you're restricted in the type of parts you can use based on what kind of nation you are running, but the basics are all the same.

so you simply take over all the cities on your planet and then you can move to the last stage.  I won't comment on that since I haven't been bothered to play one civilization long enough to get there, but I'm not motivated by the game to work on it.  At this stage they should have changed the name from Spore to Chore because it's not fun or interesting.

While many others have elected to give this game poor marks because of the DRM, I gave it poor marks because it had so much promise in the early stages of its development, and then they sucked the life out of it to turn it into a collection of minigame/stages that are loosely connected.

I wanted the game Will Wright was showing off in 2005.

UPDATE:  I finally finished the Civ stage.  I don't know why it was so annoying before but this time I blasted right through it, even earning the ""Military Strongman"" achievement even though I was a religious nation.

After that I was treated to the Space stage, and this is why everyone wants the game really.  The first 4 stages are nothing compared to the last stage.  You can't just jump to the last stage though until you get there normally.

When you finally get there, you have a lot of exploring to do, hidden stuff to find, special galactic formations, wormholes, etc.  This too is fun for a while, but I'm eventually going to get bored of fighting/bribing and buying my way to the center of the galaxy.

Creepy & Cute expansion pack?  No, I think those are lame ideas.  It's like you bought a Barbie Doll and now they want to sell you new clothing.  It won't add enough to the game.

Sorry for this being so long.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far."

45269,2,"I got this game as I love the tycoon games like zoo tycoon, roller coaster tycoon, etc. also diner dash and that type. It loaded quickly but even after watching the tutorial I couldn't figure out how to play it.
I got to the first place you added stuff to the restaurant wall, and was stuck. I seen no way to figure it out, so I ended up unloading it. The graphics were okay. They weren't cartoonlike they were more realistic and you could watch the restaurant from different angles and inside and outside. Supposedly you can build other restaurants but since I couldn't get past the first one, I guess I never will. Definitely would not recommend it for kids."

191286,2,"Okay, there are more in depth reviews here, so after playing it for a couple of weeks I'll just tell you what I think. I was excited about it after seeing the trailer for it, but it does not live up to the hype at all. It does play chess, which is good, but I really don't think it teaches you very much. I don't know why there's a five star review that says it's great for teaching yourself.
I'm not saying it's bad... it's just not that good. I think I'd give it a D+... not actually failing, but close to it."
116464,2,"To start off, I know countless people absolutely love this game. I however am not one of those people. I played through the story and I just didn't like how it flowed. Some parts made no sense to me and there were WAY too many cutscenes. At parts in the story I had no idea where to go and what to do, when I finally found out it wasn't a sense of satisfaction, it was more a feeling of, oh that was a stupid way to go, a feeling of disappointment. The graphics however were good, not incredible but good and the locations you go to are fun and interesting for the most part. However, I wasn't a fan too strongly of the controls and Drake just left too much to cinematics and strange story to me. Not my favorite."

225216,2,"I have played fight night on both the original Xbox and 360. It took considerable time to master the punching system, especially during the switch from Xbox to 360. This game would be better served as the first fight night rather than the fifth installment. The punching system is so basic that any movement of the stick causes a random punch. Blocking is reduced to pushing a button when expecting a puch rather than upper block and lower block. In fact, trying to use the blocking system from round 3 or 4 results in punches.

Trying to implement the systematic punches of earlier version of the game results in added frustration for those of us who adapted to the punching scheme. I enjoyed the addition of the championship mode, but the enjoyment was short lived once I realized how much the controls changed."
467135,2,"In time for the holidays (and the debut of Nintendo's Wii), Activision released Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the new system to take advantage of it's innovative control capabilities.  While the end results were mixed to say the least, Activision ports Downhill Jam to the PS2, and the results here aren't much better.  Contrary to previous games in the long running series, Downhill Jam does just what it's title implies.  The trick heavy skate park based gameplay is transformed into that of a downhill racing game.  Naturally you can play as legendary skater Tony Hawk, who is the only real life skater in the game for some odd reason.  You can still perform a nice amount of tricks and combos while you race, but really, what's the point when the gameplay itself is so stale?  The tricks are super easy to pull off, but are very repetitive to say the least.  Not to mention that the race tracks themselves are blandly designed to boot and offer up some confusion in terms of ""where the heck am I going?"".  The worst factor of Downhill Jam is undoubtedly the muddy graphics and textures and the unstable frame rate that make the Wii graphics look mouth watering.  There are some pluses here though, albeit there are few.  Like the previous Tony Hawk games, Downhill Jam offers up a nice soundtrack, and the game is easy to pick up and play for newcomers to the series, but like the last few games to come from the franchise, there isn't anything we haven't seen before, and seen done much better at that.  All in all, Downhill Jam may be worth a look for fans of the series that don't own a Wii, but don't expect much at all from it."
47266,2,"This game is not that good. The EA sports series for hockey are getting to complex and boring,like this one. You don't have nearly as much control as the other Hockey games, and the slapshots stink! Get ESPN NHL HOCKEY or NHL HITS PRO."

349545,2,"The recent release of Borderlands the Pre Sequel shows a change in know-how-locale,i.e Australia,hasn't made for a better game. In fact we have been presented with Glitch-city. I have never run in to a Borderlands game,or any game for that matter, that has had so many glitches. One is bad enough,but I am only about half way through and there are four major faults with this game already.
The first biggie is the fact that they have for the first time made playing with friends the default mode. In games past it has always been the user which has determined whether to connect and play with friends,play solo,or what have you. I prefer solo first,as I always wish to learn a game on my own ,so if I do decide to play with friends,I have somewhat of an idea of how to play without embarrassing myself.
The second one is if you change it to offline(solo) it does NOT remember your selection for the next time you play. That is every game you return to play you have to pick your choice of how to play all over again. C'mon.
Thirdly, as you approach a door to the first boss battle(against Deadlift),it does no open!?? That's right,there is no access or continuance of play beyond that area. The only way to get around it is to play solo(offline) and then it will open. I only found that out by trial and error.
Fourth and finally there is a Vault key symbol in the Titan Robot Production Plant...the only one. You approach it to press""e"" to discover it, but it won't let you. You cannot discover the symbol. So there goes your perfect game,if you,like me,are trying to obtain one.
As I say I am not all the way through yet,so who knows what else I will find.
On the good side the game's controls and handling are pretty much the same from previous versions. And they give you an in game ""reward"" if this game detects any other installed version of Borderlands.
All in all a Borderlands all players of the previous versions will appreciate. However the glitches are something that should NOT be in a game like this and in that many numbers. Somebody screwed up royally in the testing department. It is not what we previous Borderlands players and/or newbies to the game should find when shelling out our hard earned bucks. 2 1/2-3 stars. And don't get me started on the guide(see my review on that)!
Nov. 11/14 Update:
Well I have finished the game and of course have found more glitches. There is what they call a ""grinder"" machine. It works by inputting three items from your back pack into it,and even moonstones that you collect,to make an entirely new weapon. Well,it doesn't work...never has,never will. I have noticed that if you travel back through a boss area you have been through and defeated,they respawn again! I can see its minions respawning but the boss? Also from the ""Hyperion Hub of Heroism""level forward,when you come near a Vault symbol to press ""e"" to discover them,you will find when you do they have already been discovered....but you haven't been there before! Lastly there is a side mission called""To Arms"".In it you have to find a box and donate about 52 weapons to it. Well every time you come back to the box,you press""e"" to open your back pack(and donate).However despite your back pack being FULL of weapons,it will tell you there are none!???? So of course there goes your donations down the drain AND any hopes of ever completing this side mission.
On this date there was a patch installed through Steam for the PC games. From what little I can see,there is no difference. All the items mentioned above are still extant.
So is this game worth your hard earned bucks on,or your parents dollars? Unless you just HAVE to have this,I would recommend backing off for a year or two. Then you not only save money but will hopefully get a game finally fixed by then."
412380,2,"I was really looking forward to this game. I spent more than three times the cost of the game, on amiibo cards. I *do* like the amiibo cards and the cute drawings of villagers on the cards, but the game itself is not great. I find myself playing for 20 minutes, designing a house, and then not continuing. I realized before buying it that it was just a spin-off, was OK with that, and didn't expect more, but still this game leaves me feeling a little empty and disappointed.

So, one star for the fact that it uses the Animal Crossing villagers, who I adore, and one point for the amiibo cards. The game itself just isn't that much fun for me. I have played HHD less than 12 hours total and feel let down by it. In contrast, I have played ACNL more than 2300 hours total without getting bored with it at all. That says it all, for me, although of course YMMV."

81238,2,"Final Fantasy VII for the ps1 was (and still is) considered one of the best RPG's ever created. The same cannot be said for the spin-off of a side-quest character that tries too hard to be hardcore and ends up being mistaken for a Devil May Cry clone.
The good news:
-You can customize your weapons to cause maximum damage.
-It's neat to see final fantasy VII characters in 3-D with voices.
The bad news:
-This game is horribly paced. You can't get into the gameplay because there's a cut scene every two minutes or so. Most of them have nothing to do with where you are fighting, so they seem terribly misplaced, and you just don't care enough about the characters to WANT to watch them. This game is way too concerned about being an animated movie rather than an actual game.
-The aiming system is shot, and you cannot lock onto enemies the way you should be able to. If this had been fixed, this could have at least been an average game.
-The same goes for the camera, you never face the direction you want to face, and that immediately gives this game the score that I've chosen for it.

I love Final Fantasy VII for the ps1. I even liked Advent Children a little bit. But this is criminal for anyone who loves the franchise."
306670,2,"Let me first start with the pros.

The Graphics are Amazing. No frame rate problems

Music & Sound is Amazing. Mightiest well be the best soundtrack of the next Gen. Weapons and abilities feel and sound real.

The Multiplayer has no Lag at all. Yes, I repeat no lag. This is rarely seen in any Multiplayer game. It does have a few Disconnects but nothing big.

Now for the Cons:

I could tell you about the story, but I would be wasting my time.... Believe it or not, thats the story...

You don't feel connected to any characters at all.

Get use to playing the same mission over and over again, just for better loot; that looks pretty much the same.

Bungie promised us a vast open worlds or universe in which destiny is playable....

I guess vast means one area of Earth in Russia and the tower to meet your friends and buy things. A portion of the moon, mars, Venus, mercury......

Wheres Jupiter, Saturn, Mars' Moons as promised?

You will find areas you cannot enter which seem opened, instead you will be blocked by an invisible wall or just die..

Bungie promised the game would be better after you hit level 20. Nope it just gets worse. The loot you need to find in order to level up is harder to find.

Your fire team can only hold what the mission allows. So you may have to drop a player from time to time.

This game is a multiplayer server based game. So if the servers are down, you have no choice but to play another game. This also could be a good thing as the game has the ability to add many things, Including missions and planets. With Destiny's and Bungies sake I hope its free...

As for me, there are many other fishes in the sea."
407137,2,"This was an awesome controller for the first three months I owned it.  The weight the feel everything is wonderful.  After three months the left stick started drifting and for first person shooters this really sucked because it would drift my aim up on it's own.  I simply can not play with this controller anymore.  Funny because my day one controller is still working fine.  This expensive controller only has a 90 day warranty to boot.  Just be warned that you may end up being able to use the controller for a very short time.  If you do a search on Xbox One Elite left stick drift, you will see that this is a big issue with this controller.

8/17/2017 UPDATE***
Well, I contacted Microsoft support as suggested by the person from Microsoft that commented on my review.  It was nice to talk to Americans that spoke perfect English, but it also sucked to perfectly understand that I was screwed.  I would have to pay to ship and repair and it was going to cost me as much, if not more than a new controller.  Bottom line - after 3 months you are screwed and left with $150.00 paper weight."
450141,2,"...only a little more advanced. You do have a lifebar,but it depleets very quickly. Lots of high jumping enimies that throw stars and slash at you. The only thing I really liked about this game was the music during the levels. Only pay $3-$5 maximum for this.

You will only get voice sound through these and you will have to turn your TV up pretty loud to compensate for this.

Otherwise, get Turtle Beaches."
316494,2,"buggy dash, laggy multi player that's not free anymore, bigger more comfortable controller but dies quicker, better graphics on third party games than Xbox if u play on a screen bigger than 60"" and sit less than 10 feet away, the last of us is currently the only good exclusive on ps4, uncharted 4 looks good but its a different team,drive club keeps.getting delayed.

In a nutshell I bought this in November and only play call of duty ghost, battlefield 4 and wolfenstein.  I game on PC for most single player, Xbox for most multi player, Sony for exclusives but since they didn't have any at launch I play ghost &bf4 so I don't have a $400 paperweight. (I don't play that $5. Indie crap) I should've waited especially since Sony closed a lot of their game studios.

Its good I just wish I stuck with x1 and PC for at least a year and a half.  For now 2stars, when the games start rolling in 3-4 stars depending on how good they are.  I'll never give 5 stars because of the flaws."

167788,2,"I just spent 2 hours with my son playing through half of the campaign in coop mode, and we decided to quit to get something to eat. I noted which mission we were on for when we come back. Returned to the coop menu later, and NONE of the missions we completed can be selected. The only option is to start over at SEMPER FI!

I suppose I'll have to play through the damn game on solo mode to unlock all the missions and then go back and play again in co-op? Give me a break. That just pisses me off and I'm not playing any more. Seriously. I quit. Putting it on the shelf.

Yes, I'm upset! We were having fun. Because this game claims to support the campaign in co-op mode, and that's how we played it--but what's the use if you can't save and continue later? What the hell, Activision? Do you expect players to go through the entire campaign in a single sitting? Unbelievable! I simply cannot believe this was an oversight. What kind of QA person would say, ""Great, that's exactly what players will want--to start over at Semper Fi if they don't finish in one sitting.""

Is that how books work, Activision? No bookmark? I start over at Chapter 1 when I can't finish the book in one sitting? I'm spitting mad right now.

While it lasted, it was extremely fun, especially with the flamethrower. But what's the point if there's no save and continue? Who the hell DOES that?

-1 star for crappy outdated graphics (even for 2008). Seriously, the models are practically boxes with textures.

-1 star for pissing me off over the idiotic co-op flaw

Another -1 star for making me lose my temper"

If you aren't convinced, I still say rent it, just so you are sure.
It is not as horrible as Simpsons Wrestling.  This game is at least playable.  Still, it never feels like you are driving a car, however, or any of the other vehicles you supposedly drive.  It's more like you are just pivoting an arrow on its axis and pushing a button to move forward and backward.  No I'm not expecting a sim experience like Project Gotham, but at least a driving experience, like Crazy Taxi.
After you unlock a few levels, you'll get bored.  It becomes even more repetitive than Crazy Taxi ever did.  The most ardent Simpsons fanatic might insist on unlocking the relatively large cast of characters, and who doesn't want to drive Homer as Mr. Plow?
But the fun wears off.  In a short time, you'll have heard all the banter of every character and gotten over the fun of driving around a very sparsely detailed Springfield.  Not that all the Springfield landmakrs aren't there, they just look terrible.  Once you've played Halo, you expect a little more than buildings that are nearly flat shaded boxes.  I hear this looks better on Xbox than PS2, but that's not saying much.
I think the development team also made a major mistake trying to make the Simpsons a 3D world.  It looks funny.  Your Simpsons heroes don't look right.  If you have the First Season DVD you've heard (in the commentary) that the show producers realized early that the 2D side perspective of faces were so much more expressive than the other views they tried in that first season.  A similar view holds for this game.  The Simpsons Road Rage would have looked beautiful if done in the style of Cel Damage.  Cel Damage's engine does 3D but it looks flat, like you are watching a cartoon.  It is absolutely stunning in that perspective (gameplay problems in that title aside).  The Simpsons Road Rage would have benefitted greatly just by using a similar engine and graphical feel.
When you finish a level you'll be irritated that they couldn't have the real Krusty voice give you your rating.  Instead, you get a horrible imitation.  You'll also wonder why you have to view a loading screen (on the Xbox no less!) to go from the game to your summary screen.  Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast didn't even do this!
You'll also realize that the key to unlocking items has nothing to do with your ability to play the game.  You just play long enough and you'll eventually unlock it all.  But it won't matter if you get better at the game.
This is a game unworthy of the Xbox.  However, the Simpsons tie-in is not too bad.  I would suggest renting it for a week and getting your fill of Simpsons laughs.  Hence the two stars."
104037,2,A former friend of mine owns all the Assassin's Creed games and I became interested in trying them out for myself. I see now that it would have been better to rent it first because I wasn't very impressed with the gameplay. It was just a lot of the same thing and overall I found it pretty boring.
467169,2,"Didn't quite play it, I'm sure it could turn out to be a very good game but I was led to believe it was very similar to the Harvest Moon / Story Of Seasons series & I don't believe that's quite true. I can't quite reccomend the game since I didn't go very far through it, but I will say that if your looking for something that's similar to the previously mentioned series, then this might not be it for you."
100125,2,"The only real positive about this game is the graphics. The transformers look very nice in all their detail. The transformation is great to look at too. Going from vehicle to robot and back again is a repeatable enjoyment as long as you're not involved in a mission.

The worst part of this game is the camera work/targeting scheme.

This is revealed best when you're recovering the All Spark as Bumblebee. There are endless cockroach-like robots surrounding you and they don't want you to get it. (Note: if you turn into the car, you're instantly dead) They hit you with enough force to throw you back into walls and out of the ""action area"". You will be turning the camera constantly as you'll find yourself looking inside a wall or anywhere other than at the enemy.

This seems to be a Bumblebee issue because when you play as Ironhide, you just smash through those pesky things.

The targeting scheme needed an automatic lock-on feature. When you need to throw a tree or pole at Starscream you'll find yourself tossing it just to the side of him. Too frustrating.

I didn't mind the missions as some have said they were too short or repetitive. The driving details are difficult but it just takes a few missions to get used to how the steering works. It's not like every racing game where you can turn with ease at 150 MPH. You just have to get used to it.

The biggest drag to this game is the camera work. And it's enough to pull this review all the way down to two stars."
495723,2,"Very nice mouse for the price.  I like the ergonomic shape - it fits my medium sized male hand rather nicely.  It is a palm grip mouse, giving support to all five fingers.  The detachable palm rest is a nice touch for those looking to move the mouse with the bigger muscles of the forearm.

Unfortunately, the left and right click buttons require too much force to actuate, taking the 'ergonomic' out of the mouse.  The further away from the edge of the button that you click, the more force is required. That will impact those with small hands the most.

If you do have RSI type issues, this is not the mouse for you...

FWIW, the build quality seems nice.  The mouse is reasonably lightweight at 113g without the weights and palm support.  The wheel is nicely notched."

142817,2,"WHY ON EARTH did I call this game the ""Game Of Hope""??????

Keep reading..........

Viking could have been one of the coolest games....Big, bloody battles, swingin' axes, big terrain, legions of armies, saving your buddies, did I mention BLOOD? (In which there's a-plenty!) And that's about the only good thing in this game......(NO, not the big terrain, or armies....I meant, the BLOOD!)

I'd like to give this game a great review!
I'd love to say this game has a great fighting platform.
I'd love to say that the user's manual is helpful
I'd like a lot of things.....

But, you ain't gettin' NONE'a THAT from this game!

Positive note:
GORE factor in the game...AWESOME!!

As for all the running.......and running.......and running, and more running, and trying to fight 4000 guys at a time.........well, that gets a bit....ugh! DON'T GET ME STARTED!!

My God, they should have named this game something else like ""Viking: The sometimes fighting, quickly dying, how the hell do I summon my army, and much running journey to Asgard"" because that's what this game is.

OK, you start off in your town, talking & mingling, then you have to venture out into other lands....BY RUNNING THE ENTIRE TIME....OVER VAST DISTANCES.....and TRY and free your Viking buddies, while fighting some bad guys along the way. OK, I can tolerate that.... BUT, once you get to a village that holds your buddies hostage, you get jumped by like 90 bad guys! Try fighting 90 guys at once.....yeah.....It doesn't work! (anyone remember Assassin's Creed?)

Yeah, there's other things in the game, but nothing worth mentioning.

Like, after you free all these guys, that are tied up to posts, YOU WOULD THINK they would join you, and fight by your side.....NOPE! They RUN HOME! .........UH, I NEED YOUR HELP HERE!

OK, I must be honest, there are CERTAIN times when your Viking pals actually DO help you.....Like, when you rescue your buddies that are in the ""cages"", THEY will help you fight, but, when you find guys tied to posts....uh, don't expect these guys to do ANYTHING except run home to momma! That's ALL THEY DO.....RUN HOME.....as quickly as possible. Now, I suppose if I were held captive, I'd run home to momma, too, but, this is a game, and they should be kicking some bad-guy butt right alongside you!

There's something about a Dragon that's supposed to help you, too....Not worth mentioning either....

ALSO, you're supposed to be able to use your Viking Pals for help & aid in a large battle....YEAH, RIGHT!...OK, Somebody show me how it's done! There's NO MENTION of this in the user manual, I guess you're supposed to just know how to do it....OH, I KNOW, I'm supposed to use ESP....My BRAINWAVES will SUMMON my army when I need help!......The User's Manual doesn't say HOW to summon your army, doesn't say what button to push, doesn't say WHEN you can do it.....NOTHING!

So, lemme get this straight:  Tons of running, more running, getting tag-teamed by 300 bad guys at once (just like Assassin's Creed), horrible controls, horrible Assassin's Creed fighting platform, lousy story.....SOUNDS GREAT! I GOTTA HAVE THIS GAME!

You gotta keep going to villages, trying to free your buddies, while getting jumped by 90 guys at a time, and trying to stay alive for more than 13 seconds.....and you have to do all this with the WORST FIGHTING SYSTEM in the world. And talk about SLOW! HOLY CRAP, my Grandma can swing a sword faster than this idiot! She can run faster, too!!!!!

So, I call this game, ""The Game of HOPE"".....WHY?

> HOPE I can figure out the controls
> HOPE I can find all the runes
> HOPE the owners manual was better
> HOPE my guy can swing a blade faster
> HOPE something cool will happen soon
> HOPE I can free these guys without getting gang-jumped
> HOPE I can figure out how to get my army to help me
> HOPE I can beat 90 guys at a time
> HOPE I can find a horse soon, so I don't run all the time
> HOPE I don't have to fight any more guys right now
> HOPE I can get my money back for the game!

And that's it......nothing more to report here.....

OH YEAH! I almost forgot....the graphics are awesome!"
31602,2,"Okay, first off, I didn't glance at this game; I immersed myself in this game.  Please ignore those reviewers who played a game or two and said this game was great.  I played approximately 10 exhibition games, a twenty game season with playoffs, created players, and explored all the various game modes, and played quite a few 2 player games.  This game really seems to capture the essence of baseball.  Notice I used the word ""seems"".  When looking at this game in depth, this game has no long-term playability.
First off, the graphics are terrible.  I mean really, really terrible.  It's almost like they transported the player graphics from Super Nintendo land.  The feel of baseball is almost deadened after looking at the super cheap animations.  Of course in most sports games, graphics shouldn't matter.  This is baseball though - the ambience, the look of the grass, the feel of the crowd, the skyline, all contribute to good game.  This hampers it.
I would gladly sacrifice graphics for a good game.  At first, I thought it did.  After a few exhibition games, I felt like they finally reached the holy pantheon of sporting games, to be seated next to Madden 97 and the original NHL for the PC, NBA 2K and NFL2K for the Dreamcast, Lakers vs. Celtics for the Genesis, and Baseball Simulation 2000 (yes, 2000, even though it was released in the 80s) for the original NES.  My hopes quickly faded.
The games' pitching-batter interface is very polished, and definitely is the game.  Unfortunately, it's full of glitches.  In one camera angle, the high and low pitches are distinct, but outside and inside pitches are awful.  In another angle, the exact opposite occurs. Why not have an angle that can show both?  In two others angles, it's just plain impossible to judge anything.  Curveballs are a plain joke, and couldn't even fool Jeremy Burnitz, while sliders and change-ups are just plain evil to hitters.
Don't get me started on the Home run contest.  I hit ten home runs on ten pitches with Shinjo.  With Barry Bonds, the only way not to hit a home run is to not make contact.
In terms of long-term play, I started off in pro level, and after steady improvement, I easily mastered it and progressed into all-star level.  All of sudden, my team was chalked full of Jose Cansecos and Dave Kingmans.  Even though I averaged three to four runs a game, almost all my runs were off home runs, the vast majority being solo shots.  Troy Glaus drove in more than half my runs.  For the very few times I got a single, the next at-bat resulted in a double play.  This type of game would bore any true baseball fan to death.
So my offense stagnated, but I won approximately half my games on all-star level.  Then I noticed something.  Mostly all the games I played were one run games.  Out of these, the games were decided in the last two innings.  All of them.  No matter how much I altered the simulation level, the game would massage the abilities to make it a close score.  Any true baseball fan, like me, would be revolted.  Part of baseball consists of 12-1 games along with the 3-2 games.  Closers proved worthless.  To test my hypothesis, I chose to play the Angels versus the Yankees in the playoffs.  In every game that I was leading going into the eighth, my pitchers couldn't throw any strike except right down the middle, and all the Yankees became the re-incarnation of Barry Bonds.  Even though I could easily strike out Bernie Williams in the second inning, I would give up walk upon walk to Alfonso Soriano.  Of course, constantly walking Alfonso is not just a minor glitch; it's release-stopping bug!  While losing, Troy Percival would be pitch like Byun Hung Kim in the World Series.  After he gives up the lead, he'd pitch just like Pedro.  This type of things flies in the face of actual simulation and just plain ruins the game.  I found myself not trying to score in the fifth and sixth inning so I can have a chance of winning.
So, the earlier innings are a waste, and the offense is boring as heck, the computer's AI sacrifice's the very notion of simulation, the graphics are terrible, and it's full of annoying glitches.  Why would anyone want to play this game?  A baseball game is made to be played for a long time, and this doesn't come close.  The only thing that redeems is it is that it's still pretty good in two player.  Of course, try to get a friend to come over and play a whole season - good luck.
Baseball is the hardest game to simulate, and this game just could measure up.  I wasted some serious cash on this, so I hope you don't."
367075,2,"I've loved dinosaurs since as long as I can remember, and I also love RPGs.  Back when the original Fossil Fighters came out, I fell in love with it despite the subpar graphics and goofy storyline.  It really combined my love of RPGs with the fun of dinosaurs, and that is a good combination!  I figured I'd better enjoy it, because I'd never see another game like it.  Then, much to my surprise, a sequel came out in the form of Fossil Fighters: Champions.  The sequel improved greatly on the original, with better graphics, better characters/storyline, and better music.  Pretty much, everything was better.  Now I'm really surprised to see yet another sequel.  Will it improve on the second game?  Well, if you saw the title of this review, then you can probably guess what it's going to be...

Graphics (score 8/10): Well, the graphics are better.  I quite like the anime-style character designs, and the little character portraits that appear whenever characters speak.  If you've ever played something like Phoenix Wright, then those character portraits are going to look very familiar.  I personally like them, as they add visual interest to the characters.  The dinosaurs have also been redesigned to look cooler, and that's nice.  Unfortunately, the improved graphics haven't been put to wholly good use.  Many of the location designs (such as the towns) have way too much going on, and look visually cluttered.  The digging sites are just average-looking.

Music (score 7/10):  There's no voice acting here, which is fine by me.  The general music is pretty average, and not particularly memorable at all.  What kills it here is the inclusion of that AWFUL song from the game trailer (it's got hokey lyrics and bad singing).  Now I know it only appears near the beginning of the game (for the most part), but it's a truly cringe-worthy.  Other than that, nothing worth noting here.

Characters (score 7/10): Sigh.  I wasn't able to get very far into this game (mainly because I couldn't stand to play it for too long), but I remember the great characters from the second (and even the first) game, and I'm less impressed with this game.  The previous characters were quirky, funny, and yet surprisingly likable.  That's...less true here.  The main character is fine, and the new side characters are mostly fine.  Sadly, though, many of them seem to be based on stereotypes.  Now, I know that Joe Wildwest from the second game was a bit of a Western stereotype, but he at least felt like a real character, and had some depth to him.  Everyone else pretty much wasn't stereotypical.  In this game, though, we've got a girl who only likes cute vivosaurs, an Asian kid who's only good with technology, a fat kid who literally describes himself as a ""beachball with legs"" and an Australian character who's actually called ""Sidney"" and within the first couple sentences of speaking, uses the phrase ""shrimp on the barbie.""  Ugh.  I'm sure they thought they were being funny when they made this decision, but honestly, it was a bit too over-the-top to be funny.  It just came off as painfully irritating.

Story (score 7/10): I can't really discuss the story too much because I could not make it through this game for more than a few hours, but the tone has definitely changed from the last two games.  That sense of quirky fun and comedy seems to be gone.  The game is now quite serious (as much as a game about battling dinosaurs can be).  I kinda miss that sense of fun...

Battle System (score 1/10): Ugh, this is where things really start to suck.  They've completely revamped the great battle system from the second game and ruined everything.  First off, the new battle screen is laid-out in a terrible fashion.  It's just a visually cluttered mess (and it's very hard to tell what's going on sometimes).  Normally, the move selection screen would be on the bottom, but now it's moved onto the top, obscuring the visual action of the vivosaurs, and the bottom screen is totally devoted to an ugly grid layout for your dinosaur sprites.  Also, now you only control one vivosaur in battle, and have an A.I. partner who (sometimes) joins you (whom you don't control).  They also expect you to fire off special effects while the vivosaurs are doing their attacks, which while generally annoying, also prevents you from enjoying the nice animations that are going on because you're focused on your support effects.  Without going on further, I'll just say that the new battle system feels deeply un-fun compared to the second game (and even the first game, which was worse than the second).

Gameplay (score 1/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Double-sigh.  It's like the devs took every bad idea they had and incorporated it into this sequel.  It's sad, too, because if they had just copied the second game's gameplay (and battle system) and added a new story, they would've had a great game with relatively little effort.  Unfortunately, they decided to introduce a completely unnecessary vehicle focus, and it makes everything worse.  Those buggies feel slow and awkward, and control clunkily compared to just running on foot in the previous games.  It's hard to line them up where you want to face, and you've now got rogue vivosaurs running around and interrupting the flow of your digging with unavoidable battles (and yes, they will chase you  it's not like fighting fossil battlers at all).  Speaking of digging...now you're forced to clean fossils in the field the second you find them, which is deeply annoying because you can't save beforehand (you know, so you can try again if you fail  in fact, you now can't save in the field at all).  On top of that, instead of the cute cartoony fossils from the old games, the fossil cleaning screen now is very realistic-looking.  This sounds nice, but it isn't.  The rock is tan-colored, the bones are also now just a different shade of tan.  It makes it hard to tell what you're doing, and on top of that, you now have to move the screen to reach the whole thing (and we all remember just how ""fun"" those giant fossils from the previous game were  the difference there was that they were rare).  The overall effect of all these changes (from the vehicles to the new fossil digging system, as well as other unmentioned things) is just a mess of unpleasant and un-fun gameplay, making this game feel like a chore to slog through.

Overall (score 2/10): NOTE:  This score is not an average; its my subjective overall score.  Ultimately, this game feels like a slap in the face to fans of the first two games.  I was so excited when I heard this was coming out, and I ran out and bought it on day one release.  What a disappointment  at least I now know better than to buy games on the first day anymore.  The graphics are technically better, but that can't save this game from the horrible gameplay changes that were made.  I know this series is often compared to pokemon, but this entry will definitely end that now.  You see, pokemon is actually FUN (and continues to be fun)  this game isn't.  Sorry, but I can't recommend this entry at all.  If they manage to put out a fourth game in this series, then I sorely hope they go back to their roots."
300627,2,"As others have said, there is way too much dialogue that requires pressing A to advance past. And the battles become very repetitive... Every time the checkered wall appears I think ""oh geez not again."" I am used to the usual Mario gameplay where you search for coins and progress along either a linear path or at least have some clear objective.  This one seems to be about smashing blobs and freeing little floating heads. I'm also not sure why people call this an RPG (role playing game).  I'm putting it away for awhile and will give it another try later but it is definitely not the type of game I am interested in playing very often."
232542,2,"This was ok, I was hoping it would be more than just hidden object but it was basically all hidden object. Also, unless you have a large screen, the hidden object part is hard to see because the scenes are so busy."
147617,2,did not like
324244,2,"This game is nothing like the first one... Well, except that it looks (ie: characters), sounds, etc, like it.

I bought this gaming thinking it'd be at least somewhat close. I mean, story? What story? You just go on a mission, shoot stuff, kill stuff, rinse, wash, repeat... There's NO progression at all.

I enjoyed the first game. Even the second one (It's all about time) for the iDevice group, but this one, it just makes absolutely, positively no sense. Forced online mode, lack of split screen for 360, this is a HORRIBLE remake, not even worthy of the PvZ name!"
235549,2,This is a cheesy game. Save your money unless your in to zombie/alien garbage
215277,2,"The Turntable is fine, but the game DJ Hero 2 itself is a joke. The first DJ Hero was brilliant and allowed you to actually feel like you are controlling parts of the music. What I mean is, the 1st installment of this game would stop the other track when you moved the cross fader and the scratching was more fun. The 2nd installment of this game is like any current Guitar Hero. It's more then obvious that DJ Hero 2 was produced and shipped quickly for speed and does not contain a 1/4 of the ingenuity that went into the first version and most of the music is garbage. But hey, it came with the Turntable, I gave it to my little cousin because the game sucked that bad and I will never buy any of the extra music."
5857,2,"This game was quite... what's a nice word for it... bad. I don't completely remember, but I think this game was given to me for a birthday present or something, so I do feel bad for whoever it was who gave it to me... what a waste of good money. Sure, at times it could be addicting, but it's way too repetitive and too long.
I think I'll sell it the first chance I get. I don't care what kind of games you like, don't get this one at all."
162461,2,"Much like everyone else, I was excited when UPS delivered my release-date copy of Diablo 3. After the install, I had to exit to create a battle.net account. Then had to exit to update my video driver, but finally I was set to play. I strong-armed my college-aged son for a little all-night monster bash, and we jumped right in. I wasn't overjoyed by the simplified character development, but overall it's a new version of my all-time favorite game. Simple and easy interface, gorgeous environment, etc.
That crashes. And keeps crashing.
Then the servers stop. And stop again.
So - this might be the best game of the decade, but if noone can play it since the servers are down - what difference does it make? Would have saved me a few hours if at install time it popped up saying ""Don't bother, you can't play. Just wait a month or two for Torchlight 2""
Oh, and I agree with all the other comments about no offline single-player mode. Absolutely stupid. Even when the servers are back up. It means that if I lose my internet connection, no game.
And, since their support forums are now down as well, no-one can hear the players scream!"
199442,2,"This game honestly I got it for it's price and like the saying says 'you get for what you pay for'. Then again this is the first nba 2k for the psp, so I'll wait to give an honest review. For now, go with NBA Live 10. The graphics and gameplay are obvously better with EA since they been doing the game for a longtime. I only gave it two stars for having Kobe on the cover."
175250,2,"I own a God of War Red PSP.  I am a video buff and any screen upgrade on any product, I usually pick up.

The PSP 3000 does have great contrast, brightness, and color.

The problem is that with any fast moving object shown on screen, scan lines show up.  To describe, they are like tiny little horizontal black bars across an object.  You can only notice them when you are looking for them, but still.

Sony announced that this is not a defect, but a feature and it won't be fixed.

If you already own a PSP 2000 series, there is no need to upgrade.  If you don't own a PSP yet, pick up a 2000 series model while they are still available."
339590,2,"No PS/2 support? - 1 star
USB hub? - 1 star (I have one, thanks. Don't build in crap I don't need.)
Audio jacks? -1 star (I can't even process that one. Go play with some legos or something. I want a *keyboard*.)

I only bought this because real keyboards are at least 100$ more. You get what you pay for. At least it works. Lol. A keyboard that requires windows 10. What a frigin joke. I nominate the designers to head NASA's mision to explore the surface of the sun."
58011,2,"Long loading times at the start of every battle.  A battle system that forces you to fight a certain way; a certain way that makes even the trivial random encounters take >5 minutes per battle.  A short main story arc with dozens of annoying side quests that will have you spend more time walking from point A to point B (namely between 2nd miltia and the Kukai Foundation) than you will doing everything else in the entire game.

The story even seems to lag a bit in the beggining, but luckily the second half of the game or so seems to pick up the pace.  As The cutscenes and story are good, but seem lacking compared to the first one as well.  Albedo can only laugh maniacally for 5 minutes straight a couple of times before it gets old.

Did I enjoy playing the game?  no.  Do I recomend it?  no.  But,...since I plan on playing the 3rd episode as well (which is supposed to be much better) I trudged my way through it."
477435,2,"The case arrived so beat up and snapped that it doesn't stay closed. I bought it for my son, so I had him put the game in to make sure it wasn't damaged also. So far so good. 2 stars because of the condition it arrived in. No scratches on actual disc though, thankfully."
154700,2,"It works great, but you don't need it to play the game. I guess it's good for people who just can't imagine the remote as a wheel. I bought it for my kids. They like it because it looks cool, not because it helps them steer at all."
106561,2,I tried playing this game twice and will probably never go back to it. The controls and the camera are very sloppy and amateurish. Pointing out 'cliche' gameplay doesn't make it any better; it's still fairly boring. Maybe later levels would be better but I just cannot be bothered playing to them. I thought Hit 'n' Run a much better game.
428375,2,"This is from the point of view for those of us with large heads.

My personal experience was unfortunately not very good with this headset. I read other reviews that said individuals comfortably wore these headphones with glasses...well that might fly for a ten year old sized head, but for a full grown, 6 ft+ adult such as myself, there was no way I was going to comfortably wear this headset, much less so with my glasses on. I started to get a headache from the pressure after wearing the headset for 5 minutes.

Second, the sound quality wasn't very good. This might have been exasperated by the fact that on my headset, only one side produced any sound when I had the earphones plugged all the way into the mini-amp that came with the headset. When I pulled the plug out a bit, then I got sound in both headphones, but it was fairly lackluster and even with the volume on max on both my computer and the mini-amp, it still wasn't very loud.

Last problem was that the microphone didn't work."

121721,2,don't use it
343982,2,Not that good unless your a big fan of 2d jrpg. Personal I am not with the whole first person view and feels like an old pc game with good art work but that's all its going for it. As close can get to persona like game without being a persona game. Characters same old in all these type games but feel less fleshed out. It feels like half product with low budget that was rushed. Had some potential but maybe never had budget to make it what could have been. Very over priced and maybe at 10 dollars be worth it. funny enough I bought original persona 1-2 on vita and games that with older quality from many years ago felt like they were a still a few levels above this. Imo just better games of this genre out there worth price and time. But like mention above if fan of jrpg 2d art with same like story as persona then ya could enjoy it.
304954,2,"Many have already talked about network issues. So, I am not repeating here. The gameplay itself gets bored pretty fast. It's because the map is way too small. You will find yourself trying to squeeze in every single inch of the land to build roads and buildings. I can't even level the land. Many roads can not be connected even they should. I have to take down Industrial areas and trying to fill in with more space for my residents. It is a challenge to dedicate space for Residents due to the small land. You will find yourself very hard updating your Town Hall and University. My university student enrollment can never reach 1000....at most, I only got 700 in a day.

While it is fun to see my friend's towns and helping out each others, the online gameplay is not what I expected. I expect I can build a huge town with a road connecting to my friends'. EA is limiting my gameplay by allocating only certain areas for players. Well, I hope they will have a patch to modify the land size and other things in the near future."
405341,2,"The Logitech G29 Driving Force Race Wheel is a solid product.  I say this as an owner of the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G27-Racing-Wheel/dp/B001NT9TK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G27 Racing Wheel</a>&nbsp;for over five years.  From all indications the G29 is built to the same standards as the G27 and I would expect the lifespan and reliability to be similar.

Now that said, the two wheels are not *exactly* the same - the differences I am aware of are:
- The G29 costs about $80 more than the G27 when it first came out.  Value wise the G27 is better.
- The G29 does not come with a shifter like the G27 does, instead it is a separate purchase.  Another plus for the G27, though I will say this isn't a big issue for me as I use the paddle shifters on the wheel almost exclusively.
- The G29 is built to be compatible with the Sony PS4, while at this time the G27 cannot be used with the PS4.
- Though this can be used on both the PS4 and a PC, the button layout obviously lend itself to PS4 use.  (I am using it on a PC, mainly for iRacing.)
- The brake pedal has been modified to more closely resemble how an actual car brake feels - the pedal moves much less and encounters increasing resistance as the pedal is pushed down.  I like how the G29 succeeds in making the pedal feel a bit closer to a car's brake, but my son who races more than I do is not as impressed and prefers the G27 brake.  In all, this is a case of ""different"" but not necessarily ""better"".

So I would call this a 4-star product for PS4 users and a 3-star product for PC / PS3 users - except I have to dock the G29 for Logitech's poor after-warranty support.  Many parts on the G27 and G29 are made of plastic and can break, and other parts (the potentiometers or ""pots"" in the pedal system in particular) will wear out over time.  Logitech only had one spare part available for the G27 (the power adapter) has currently has no spare parts for the G29.  So if a part breaks or wears out and you are out of the warranty issue you will get no help whatsoever from Logitech.  In my case I asked about a lost screw that attaches the G27 shifter to a table and about worn out pedal pots - in each case Logitech said there was nothing they could do.  That might be tolerable for a cheap controller or mouse, but I do not consider a $400 racing wheel a throwaway product and I find this level of support unacceptable.

The fact that previous G27 owners are forced to upgrade to the G29 to race on the PS4 is also unfortunate (though I understand that this is at least partly Sony's fault).

So overall a solid if overpriced product.  I will enjoy this wheel as long as it remains trouble-free, but I know that after the warranty expires any support from Logitech is likely to be non-existent.  Also noted that the new generation of wheels (G29 and G920) has reduced the warranty from three years to two."
293343,2,"I am a big fan of open world games... I play them almost exclusively, with some FPS thrown in here and there for some diversity.  I enjoy the freedom of open worlds, with the weight of decisions falling on your shoulders.  Games like Dragon Age, Skyrim, Fallout, Diablo... those are my bread and butter.  However, I cannot get behind Watch_Dogs.  Like most others, I was so psyched when I heard about it at E3 a while back, and thought that it would be the coolest thing.  In my mind, however, they totally ruined what could have been a great concept.  My biggest issues are the controls.  The graphics are very nice, I have no issues there. I personally find the control scheme cumbersome... like a knock off of GTA or most other open world games.  Missions seem weird to me... like I'm told to knock out the leader of a gang ring, NOT kill him, but it doesn't tell me which one he is.  Either I just don't have a grasp on how the game is supposed to work, or it is just flawed this much.  Either way, I am glad that I only paid $20 for it a while ago, because otherwise I would be very annoyed with the quality of this game.  It just doesn't float my boat."
87361,2,Red Steel has sluggish controls when it comes to aiming. There is not a lot to be said about this game that other reviews have not already said. Graphics are of Gamecube quality. Sound is decent. When you use the sword it is not the most responsive. This game is a waste of money.
452641,2,"Auto modelista is a huge let down as far as racing sims go with only one saving grace. The thing that matters the most in a videogame is the core gameplay, length, and replay value, and auto modelista falls flat on its face in all three categories.
First of all the core gameplay. The game has very short, unmemorable tracks, which is really a shame because the graphics are excellent. The cars drive terribly, powerslide around every turn. As for the car selection, the game consists mostly of uninspired import cars, and the occasional viper or corvette.
As for the length of this game, it took me roughly 3 hours to beat, which is laughable compared to the 35 hours i have on final fantasy 10, and im still nto even close to done! The longest race is 4 or 5 laps long across a tin race course, really the load times took more than the race time most of the time.
As for the replay value, once you beat the game, your done, might as well use this game for kindling in your fire place. Yes, it does feature online game play, but  it is terribly uninspired, and just as boring and brief as the offline expierience.
So what is the one saving grace of this game? The pretty graphics of course! Through all of the flaws the light of graphics does gleam through on this not so shiny gem. Customizing your car is extremely entertaining, and finding all the perfect tones of paint for your car. There is also a wide array of stickers, and a custom sticker maker. The down side of the sticker maker is that it is no where near user friendly, and a tutorial would have been VERY helpful.
In conclusion your money is much better spent elsewhere. This is the kind of title that comes out terrible, then the sequel unexpectedly blows you away, so lets just keep our fingers crossed that if there is an aut modelista 2, they completely overhaul the terrible controls and make the races MUCH longer!"
188610,2,"Never having played the original Two Worlds, and seeing the rather virulent hatred or defense of this, I figured I had to give this a stab. I expected a Oblivion-esque free world RPG setup, which is essentially what it is. However, development and display is where this totally trips over its own two feet, and its a real shame.

Graphics are rather nice. I keep hearing comparison to Ps2 graphics,and while its true that the polish is not up to current spec, it makes up in depth what it lacks in detail. Creatures are almost WYSIWYG, very difficult to do if you're planning on making eq drops nearly random. However, there are so many clipping and coloring errors that its hard to go more than a few minutes without encountering some.

Audio is almost rather decent. Your character needs to lighten up a little, as he sounds nearly robotic with some of his delivery, as if he's expecting to strangle you and your little dog too during every conversation

Control and HUD display is where this starts to be completely crippled. Setting up your controls is painful and while quite a few controls are actually rather well put together (same button controls crawl and sprint, for instance) others are extremely ham handed. Targeting is a struggle, and certain item classes are bizzarely handled for how they appear in the inventory. It almost looked like they were trying to go for a Demon's Souls control scheme, which would've worked beautifully had they used it.

Story and characters are where this starts to die. In the opening sequence, Enemy General fights Friendly General, and beats him. And rather than kill him, cripple him, or even wound him, he spouts off an Evil Overlord quip and turns away, allowing Friendly General to kill him. I actually had to turn off the game and restart it, as my brain refused to believe something so trite and dated could happen in a game that otherwise appeared to take itself seriously. And while the advancement scheme is at least somewhat original, its so poorly executed that its a struggle to find your way through the maze of skill advancements.

Characters at least seem interesting, but the conversation scheme is bizzare it its setup, as you only have two dialogue choices, which 4 or more relevant options. Some characters have outfits so hackneyed and overdone that they're completely ridiculous, and its a struggle to interact with.

Further hurting chances are the absolute deluge of glitches. Graphical, audio, handling, and freezes abound.

Overall, this had some serious promise, completely obliterated by aspects of the delivery that totally ruin suspension of disbelief, as well as the feel that you're playing in an epic. A major overhaul of certain scenes and interface could change this from 2 stars to 4.5, but without a serious polishing, this is clearly still a beta game. Truly, a shame."
146240,2,Not good for me!
429913,2,"I want to like this mouse so badly. After 15 years they finally got the button locations right, moving ""forward"" back far enough that you can easily reach it (unlike the MX518/G400). And it's a beautiful, comfortable mouse, too.

However, the sensor is a real problem. It's overly sensitive, to the point where if there are *any* irregularities on your mousing surface it will skip, or will read fast/slower depending on the texture. So you could move the mouse across the pad at an even pace, but it might speed up or slow down depending on slight variations on the pad. It was unusable on my older, worn mousepad and it's already unreliable on my new Razer mousepad that I got a few months ago. That shows no real signs of wear, but get a little dust or dirt on it and the mouse starts acting weird.

My old Logitech mice would work reliably on almost ANY surface, even carpet if I was hooked up to a TV. So this is hardly something there is an excuse for.

It also has a lot of little crevices on the bottom and I find myself having to clean lint and crap out of them frequently - again, something I never had to do with my old Logitech mice.

I think for my next mouse I'll be leaving Logitech behind."
227400,2,Just not my taste.
13711,2,"Is one of my favorite games. When I first started playing it, it was doing good. Then it kept freezing and I had to return it."
431784,2,"There's really nothing special about this mouse.
The adjustable thumb rest is pretty neat, but otherwise this is pretty uninteresting as a gaming mouse.
There is a mouse sensitivity button placed directly next to the scroll wheel which must have a hair trigger because I bump this thing all the time.
You can adjust the LGB colors on the mouse using some Corsair software, but it resets to default almost daily for me, I just gave up on it.
If you are like me and prefer quiet mice over loud ones, this thing clicks like you are compensating for something (loud!)."
465923,2,"not sure if works since not easy to figure how to delete whats on it, it was used and keeps saying too full to be usable at present time it is a hassle till figure out how to delete whats on it..with other cards had no problem deleting whats on them..if only can do that again on this one?"
336998,2,"Sigh. The thing feels solid enough, and the ergonomics are good. It all seems fairly promising. But I've had two major snags that make the device kind of useless to me:

1) The battery doesn't seem to charge properly
2) I bought it to use with RetroPie on the Raspberry Pi. While official PS3 controllers are recognized immediately by RetroPie, the SlickBlue is not.

Together, these make the device a bust, certainly for my needs. I also don't understand why the USB socket is mounted in the reverse direction to those of the official controllers, meaning you can't use your charging station with this stick."
336771,2,These are comfortable but when you get involved in a game they tend to roll right off the joystick. I would rather play without them so that I don't waste time trying to put them back on all the time.
32262,2,"Tetris is awesome. I could play that time waster all day - but something is amiss with this game and it manages to make me not want to play.

It could be the loud thumping synth and techno music that plays in the background on infinte loop, or it could be the fact that they attempted to add a story to Tetris by adding strange ""creatures"" that speak a more annoying version of Animal Crossing's babelese, it could be that the colors look like they have been washed out and are difficult to tell apart, or it could be that there are barely any modes to play except marathon tetris games.

I think the real reason is that they just botched it. Its Tetris in some ways but there's just something off about it."
6679,2,"When this thing was new it was certainly all the rage, but its main rival, the Sony Playstation was still a step ahead no matter Nintendo did.  Nintendo releases games like Goldeneye and Starfox, two GREAT games, but then Square and Sony release Final Fantasy VII to america, which certainly changed things.  On specifics, the N64 is 5 times more powerful than the playstation.  But the N64 cartridges hold no where near as much space as the playstations black CDs.  Why Nintendo didn't bother to use CDs as they originally planned confuses many to this date.  CDs last longer, and in truth, are harder to damage.  A bad drop on a tile floor may send fragments of plastic and silicon from your ""F-Zero X"" could be all over the kitchen floor.  Nintendo did have one thing going for it over Playstation, remakes of classic games.  With the 8bit Nintendo, they started some great games out.  Then with the 16bit Super Nintendo, they made 16bit counterparts to the 8bit games.  Now with this 64bit system, they made counterparts to the 16 bit games.  This was their edge, and it made the system sell very well.  In the long run was this systems downfall.  Games are much harder to produce for N64 than they are playstation.  Even though it it more powerful than the playstation, it is still second to it.  What will happen soon, is anyone guess.  Nintendo next year will release their new Gamecube.  Gamecube doesn't play DVDs like Sony's Playstation 2, and it doesn't appear so far to be anymore powerful.  Playstation 2 will be hard to beat for one, as you can see by it's current demand.  It seems that Nintendo has become the underdog, with giants such as Microsoft entering the race.  Perhaps they'll pull through, its unknown.  Sega's Dreamcast is certainly on it's way down, it will not be possible to compete with the much more powerful Playstation 2 and Microsoft's X-Box, and possibly the morepowerful gamecube.  Word to the wise, if you're planning to buy a top of the line system, I do not currently suggest this system.  Dreamcast is a good bet for the buck, but waiting a while seems to be a wiser choice."
494942,2,"So, here is my problem with this game. I started my game, first time, hardest setting, all of the hard modes enabled because why not. I get to playing, a few hours in, and I hit a roadblock. I unlocked a few places, explored everything I could, every mission in my log was done except for the main game one. So I look up what I have to do, and nothing works. None of the characters I was supposed to see would talk to me. Multiple guides, I follow them all. Nothing works. Nothing I would do would move the main mission forward. So I start killing NPCs. Starting with the one at the top of the list of the NPCs I need to talk to. And I work my way down. Fast forward an hour or two and every NPC in the only 8 places I can go are dead. The main mission still wasn't updating.

I am not going to recommend this game to anyone and I will not be playing it any further."
138795,2,"It started off a great game.  However you are forced into the auction house because the drops just aren't there.  By the final difficulty level, the mobs were chain-stacking pools of lava and poison deep enough that you spend more time running away than fighting.  All in all, if I had quit playing 1/2 way through I would have rated it higher.  By the end it's just rediculously hard since you never get any drops."
292064,2,"Well, Angry Joe's review of this game is on youtube now. Even Gamespot's review was pretty damn accurate. I can't wait to buy this game for $5 on steam with hopefully all DLC included so I can get a more complete leveling experience than all of you guys who dished out more than $60 on collectors editions. Hope you guys like 8-15 hour story campaigns for a ""huge"" game world where it obviously was a set up for BUY THE SEASON/EXPANSION PASS TO GET MORE OUT OF IT. Hope you like grinding in the same locations you previously encountered as before with Dinkglage Bot. Since Bungie screwed up on this end, can we just do PVP to level up? It'll be vastly unbalanced, but you'll get more of a rush that way. Boy do I hate myself for saying that too.  The linear progression of this story makes post-launch  Act II of Diablo III on inferno difficulty amazing.

I keep reading these arguments for this where somebody states ""you wouldn't judge World of Warcraft like this as soon as it was released, would you? It was't as compl--"" (insert a sound of my hand slap to that person's face)

OF COURSE I WOULD! BUT AT THE TIME, THERE WAS MORE CONTENT INSIDE OF WOW TO KEEP PEOPLE BUSY BEFORE THE FIRST MAJOR PVP UPDATE BACK IN 2004! When you installed WOW on your machine you had a huge MMO world that wasn't boxed in as this. Excited about exploring the game world? Well, then I hope you like Battlefield 3 style ""do-not-go-further-than-this"" zones.
Ready for countless hours of level grinding in the strangest endgame section ever created? Ready to raise a Light rating to finish your level cap.. instead of..you know, leveling up more the traditional way?
Ready to beat the base story quickly to replay the same content your drudged through with Dinklebot? I mentioned that already but like this game, repetition is never a good thing and this game has PLENTY to go around! Weee!
Ready to still not freaking understand what the heck is going on, even after the level cap concludes? And then wonder why didn't they put said feature or event inside of the actual game!
Ready for non existent social features with other players like not being able to trade or mail items you can't use and...kicking a ball in the tower....wooo.
THEN! Get ready for the most ridiculous RNG loot system to grace a game where grinding and repition is dominant over varying content. This makes crafting in post launch Diablo III look like....Diablo II! Repetition? Of course! This is Bungie's new IP!
Alrighty, then Destiny is your IKEA of a ""next-gen"" MMO. It'll get better after you pay more for it I assure you. And the only reason you are still playing it is because this is what you have for $60-$100. You are stuck with it because you want to try to get your money's worth (insert sobbing denial noise). It'll get better, it must get better, yes, it must.

So what did Bungie get right after the very lackluster character creation that makes EQ1 have amazing options? It plays like Halo...if you love that. I mean it seriously feels like you are playing Halo so when you pick up the controller you will immediately feel at home. It's very smooth and feels great. Of course that can also mean very sluggish compared to players how are used to Counter-Strike or Call of Duty 4. Vehicles are essentially fun to travel around on but are already limiting. The music is amazing, almost personifying the ""excitement"" level more than the actual gameplay or enemy encounters. It has beautiful skyboxes and character models and yaddy yadda yadda.
Sigh...Zod Damnit, people. And Zod damn you Bungie! Why even bother releasing something so stripped and labeling it Next-gen? What a let down.
Stick with Borderlands 2. Maybe come back 5 years later to see how this shaped up with more content."

81844,2,"It is not the worst game I have played this year, but, far from the best. As we age, we see new movies or books or games that have been done before. Sometimes the new movie or game is acutally better than the original. Usually though, it is an average redo with new technology to ""make it the best ever"". If you never played some of the older games like Diablo, than this is well worth buying. Otherwise, you may be bored. Sort of like watching another slasher flick; you know when she is going to die."

Thankfully I have another mech keyboard that doesn't ghost, but if you are planning to play games that require a lot of keys to be pressed, I would avoid this keyboard.

I'm glad I didn't waste 60 bucks on this game.
444132,2,"I really wanted to like this game, I did.  I loved the original Mass Effect Trilogy, but this one just completely misses the mark.  Every side quest feels more like a chore, and the overall game is just tedious.  There's nothing here that makes me care about the lore or the characters the way the originals did.  There's just nothing to to get excited about.  The premise is good, but wasted in a lackluster execution, and the bad guys (the kett) along with a dead alien race (the remnant) are just poor rehashes of the collectors and protheans."

About the only thing I can say for it, the radio stations are really amusing.  Just go buy any other GTA title."

Pretty disappointing.  We already have a Hoth map and Endor map and a Sullust map.  Please, no more Sullust.  So, I guess we'll see a Jabba map and eventually some new place with the 4th dlc.

So, 16 maps total with season pass.  That's 4 maps per dlc.  No clone wars maps or vehicles.  They say, that might be a seperate game.  Keep in mind, battlefront 2, released years ago, featured maps from the original trilogy plus the prequels.  Everything in the Star Wars universe up to that point.  Plus LAN abilities.
I love Star Wars.  I bought this game when it came out because of that.  I love multiplayer Star Wars games.  The engine for this thing is fantastic.  But, and it saddens me to say this, this isn't the game you are looking for.  I understand games are more expensive now to make.  But things have gotten out of hand.  We now pay twice for what used to be 1 normal game."

150886,2,"This game is not very different from its predecessor, Vegas I, in terms of the graphics, design, and special effects. However, in this game, the player is required to create a character-type of his/her own. The player can choose from different male and female models for the main character. The player is also allowed to use his/her own face for the respective body type (male/female). What the player cannot choose is the name of the character, or the story of the game. The game also has a ranking system that promotes the player based on how many points he/she has achieved as a marksman, or in close-quarter combat or assault. The highest rank that can be achieved is elite.

The terrorist hunt mode helps the player gain points. So, the player is not required to play the story mode to accumulate points. The story of the game, in my opinion, is very unrealistic. There is also a goof-up with the story. Mind the spoiler alert when I say this: Gabriel misleads Bishop all the way in the Nevada desert to try to get him killed. This happens on the night July 3rd, the very same night that Logan and his team rescue Gabriel from Dante's Casino. The time span involved is very small. This could not have been a deliberate action on the part of the creators. Furthermore, Bishop is shown to have been unconscious for an extremely long period of time. So, he never gets to inform Logan and his team of Gabriel's betrayal.

The above error is inexcusable on the part of the game's producers. So, one star should go away for that. I also believe an out-of-the-blue character named Bishop was unwarranted. Furthermore, his voice sounds almost robotic. That goes for the female voice as well. I truly believe that an emergency situation such as the one shown in the game required the return of Ding Chavez to the field. Or if not Chavez, some other experienced Rainbow Six operative such as Eddie Price, Loiselle Louis or Murad Jamal. I also believe that a story involving a larger role for Logan was warranted after the events of the previous game.

This story was just too predictable. And Gabriel, who is portrayed to be arrogant and rather quick to take drastic actions was a poor choice for the main bad guy of the story. Someone else more powerful, smart, resourceful, and mysterious must have been shown as the main head of the attacks. Gabriel could have been portrayed as a tool who gets eliminated. I think that would have added a lot of suspense to the story. All these reasons have made it necessary for me to take three stars away from the overall rating. But the game is still a lot of fun to play. So, that part of it gets five stars. I must add that something about the ending of this game and the whole story in general leads one to conclude that Ubisoft is doing away with the Rainbow Six franchise. If I am correct, this has marked the end of Rainbow Six in the gaming world. I will not be surprised if there are no further releases in this franchise."
143629,2,"I think I was hoping for a degree of realism in the gameplay/geography/geo-political area.  It's simply not there.  You only play against three or four of the other ""civilizations"" at any given time, which limits the diversity of the experience when replaying the game.

This was my first and last experience with the Civilization franchise."
169023,2,"Torchlight is a very light action RPG in the same vein as Diablo.

Computer Specs
Intel Core i7 860 @ 2.80 GHz, 8 gig RAM, Radeon HD 5850

Documentation
The game is pretty easy to jump in and play, but the manual does a good job at explaining how to do things within the game where necessary. It could be a little more in depth as far as explaining some of the mechanics of how things work, but since the game is simple it isn't too much of an issue.

Character Creation
The character creation is very light compared to more in depth RPGs. There are only 3 classes, along with 4 character stats. There are also 3 skill trees where you can customize you characters skills. I played a Destroyer, which is your basic fighter class. I played my game on Hard. The difficulty level is selected when you create your character and can't be changed.

Getting Started
Play is based out of the town of Torchlight. This is where you get quests and sell items. There are basically 3 types of quests; story quests, kill monster X, find item x. The story is very weak and is there just to move you from dungeon level to dungeon level. It was so think that I didn't really care about it at all.

Graphics
The dungeons looked nice, but the characters were too cartoony for my tastes. That isn't to say they weren't well done, just not my style. I was able to play with the details turned up.

Gameplay
Like most shiny new games, my initial impresions were good. It was fun to explore the dungeons, find new items, and encounter new monsters to fight. You do find a lot of items, in my opinion too many items. After my character go established (about midway through the game) I rarely found an item I wanted to use. There are just so many items it becomes a chore to look at each one to see if you want it. Luckily you have a pet that you can send back to town to sell your items so you don't have to slog back to town. There are also town portal scrolls so you can go to town and return pretty quickly.  So if you want to you can pick up everything and sell what you don't need for some money. One nice feature is that you can spend your money to enchant your items. This almost always bestows a bonus to your item, but it also has a chance to do nothing (and waste your money), or strip all the bonus off your item. My items were disenchanted once all game, so it didn't happen often, but it did happen on my best item so it was a little disappointing.

It didn't take too long for the game to get boring to me for several reasons. The first it was too easy. During my fights I was able to just rush in and click without needing to think. There wasn't any challenge after my first 5 hours or so until the very end. That is another 25 + hours of mindless clicking. There are so many health and mana potions I never had to ration what I used.  Maybe it is better on Very Hard, but I am not interested in doing another play through.
The second reason for bordom was the lack of meaningful choices. You can accept or deny quests, but since you are here to play I don't why you would, other than you just want to get through the game. There aren't any repercussions . Since the game was so easy, I didn't have to think very much about what items I equipped. The most meaningful choice you have to make is whether you try and enchant your items since there is a risk of removing all bonuses.

The End Game
I finally got my wish for some difficulties during the end game. The final fight was very tough. The problem was it just wasn't fun for me. It was just some mindless avoidence while trying to do some damage. Maybe it was because I had already endured so much bordem.

Overall score (1 to 10): 5
If you are after a very light game that doesn't require much thinking, there is some enjoyment to be had. Since I got the game on sale I don't regret the purchase too much, but I wish my compulsion to finish games didn't drive me to keep playing until completion. I don't remember Diablo being so mindless, but maybe it was. Looking at the scores from other players and reviewers you can see that my mediocre score is in the minority, so there are a lot of people enjoying the game."
142568,2,great system....until i had to get it replaced cuz of an error on the system. Microsoft customer service is also awful.
116770,2,"I bought this game for my 6 year old nephew, who's really gotten into fishing over the past couple years, but usually only gets to fish when they visit grandma and grandpa over the summer.  The fishing part itself is designed pretty well.  My nephew was catching 29"" large-mouth bass within an hour.  So it must be fairly simple to pick up.  Considering the lakes in this game are apparently only filled with large sized fish, he might be disappointed when it comes to doing the real thing again next summer.  So far, we've only been able to fish two of the featured lakes.  The others are locked for some reason, I've yet to discover.  I guess that's how you progress to new levels.  Some of the controlls could be more intuitive, and the way the game loads is a bit confusing even for adults, asking about saved games, the very first time the disc loads??  The graphics are rather poor - definately, not up to HD quality.  But, I'll skip further criticism, as while I think the only reason this game rates as high as it does is because it has virtually no competition, my nephew absolutely loved it.  Like actual fishing itself, you could hardly pull him away from it."

16966,2,"Is this game fun? Yes.  It is fun. But it is not 2001 fun. It is 1995 fun.
Does this game belong on this platform? No.
This is an embarassment for Sony to touting these incredible hardware specs and then have a game like this released on this platform. But that's what happens when third party developers start trying too hard to push games out the door.
I'm waiting for metal gear solid 2. You should too."
28926,2,"This controller fits like a glove...a really tight one.  I am 16, and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time!  The Z trigger is in a worthless spot, and it's not easy to use at all (Which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay)!  The analog is in the right place this time (Thank god), but what's with the C analog?  Why can't I just use the the L and R triggers to move the camra!?!  Plus why can't I push the A button?  I swear.  Regardless how big that button is I can't use it right to save my life (And when playing a video game, that could be a bad thing)!
Don't even ask me what we'll ever need the D-Pad for, I don't know!  However this is a cool color though, so I gusse that count's for something!  Otherwise I don't recomend!  Nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers (N64 anyone?), and this one is no different!"

193133,2,"Professional reviews around the internet warned me about this game, but at a cheap price--and asked about it by the budding Star Wars fan that is my nephew--I picked it up anyway.  We did get some enjoyment out of it until at certain points even my veteran gamer self was losing patience with the sloppy 3D environments, horribly chosen fixed camera angles, and inconsistent platforming response.  We eventually finished the game due to the Star Wars license...and it also actually became somewhat entertaining as it provided a treatise on bad game design for my nephew.  Sadly, even the extras you can buy with in-game credits are ill-considered, being mostly straightforward powered-up capabilities or underwhelming masks to put on characters.

Keeping all this in mind, the whole point to trying it out remains the license and how it does look and sound faithful to the Clone Wars series.  There are also two distinct play styles involved.  I tended to like (or, rather, hate less) the twin-stick shooter style of the Clone scenarios while my nephew is apparently willing to put up with a lot to watch a lightsaber in action in the more conventional Jedi sequences.

That may make it worth a cheap buy and a one-time playthrough before returning to the excellent Lego Star Wars games."
107461,2,"I just rented and beat this game. Its worth a rental but not worth buying until it is very cheap. The graphics look like a game that came out 2 or 3 years ago. And you can beat it in about 4 hours or less. This game is fun to play and can be played more than once with getting sick of it. It has some easy 360 achievments but don't expect to get all 1000 easy. I would give this game a 5/10. Just remember not every game can be a 10. I don't think it has co-op which it should have to make it funner. But it really wouldnt be rogue warrior with two people playing. It does feel like something is missing. There are no items laying around to pick up which would have lengthened the game. No, money, cards, gun parts, dog tags, pieces of paper etc."
53386,2,"Out of the 4 128-bit consoles (PS2, XBOX, GC, Dreamcast), the XBOX is by far the worst. I've disliked the console ever since it launched in November 2001, and since then, very little has happened to make me change my mind about it.

The console reeks of soulless corporate greed. Some people may accuse Sony and their games of being soulless and corporate, but a soulless company could never make a game as beautiful and innovative as Ico, or something as charming & addictive as the first 3 Spyro the Dragon games. Microsoft seems to care about profit & appeal more than creativity and fun, and everything about the XBOX proves it.

It also reeks of arrogance. When the XBOX was in development, it was codenamed ""Project Midway"", in reference to the World War II battle where the Americans outsmarted the Japanese. That's extremely ironic, because the idiots who almost ruined the game industry (Atari, 3D0) were American, and the ones who are credited with restoring it (Nintendo, Sega) were Japanese. And let's not forget those obnoxious ""ONLY ON XBOX"" stamps that all the exclusive games have on their boxes, as if they're mocking the other consoles because they don't have those games.

Seamus Blackley, the man who designed the XBOX, thought he had the formula for a great gaming system because the console itself was powerful. When he was working on it, he didn't seem that concerned with making great games for it. The graphics over gameplay mentality that the console lives on is stupid and nonsensical. Most XBOX fanboys will brag about how powerful their console is. While it's true that the technical specs are better than the other 3 consoles, the only thing the XBOX has really used it's superior technical power for is for making better graphics, and as we all know, it's the gameplay, not the graphics, that make the game good. And what about the XBOXs games?

The XBOX was sold almost entirely on the success of the launch title Halo, which is one of the most generic and overrated games ever made. Even Microsoft themselves admits that if it wasn't for Halo, the XBOX would've went the way of the Dreamcast. The PS2 had a somewhat weak launch, but by early 2002, it was absolutely spring-loaded with A+ game after  A+ game. So why can't XBOX do the same? Calling the console a one-trick pony is  pretty much accurate because almost all of the other early (first year) XBOX games like Azurik and Nighcaster were total garbage. Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but it almost makes you wonder if Microsoft payed the gaming magazines to hype up one of their games so the whole console would sell well.

The XBOX has largely rejected Japanese support, so it makes sense that the console has largely flopped in the land of the Rising Sun. Some say that the Japanese are a bunch of selfish, overly-patriotic bastards. I say they know what's good for them. Before you call me a Japan ass-kisser, who revived the game industry from America's mistakes? Who created Pac-Man, Mario, Sonic, and many other of the best games (and game characters) ever? Who's not afraid to try new things or appear ""crazy"" because of it? Where are Yuji Naka and Hideo Kojima from? Trying to make a good console without Japan's help is like Britain trying to win World War II without America's help. It just isn't going to happen. Out of the few good exclusives that the XBOX has, ALL of them are from Japan. Gee, I wonder if it's some sort of coincedince?

It's also an RPG-deprived wasteland. Most XBOX owners will tell you that the console has RPGs in the form of Fable, Star Wars: KOTOR, and Jade Empire, but these are actually just action games in disguise, with RPG elements in them. They're just not the same as Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior, nor are they anywhere NEAR as memorable.

And where are the oddball and niche games? Niche games don't really sell well, but they usually turn out to be better than most highly anticipated titles. The PS2 has Mister Mosquito, Stretch Panic, and Katamari Damacy, the Gamecube has Cubivore and Pikmin, but what does the XBOX have for those of us who are looking for something ""different""? Nothing.

XBOX has seemingly eclipsed the PS2 in terms of popularity, which seems fitting. 2 years ago, I would've grimaced at the thought of  the XBOX overthrowing the PS2 in that category, but now that I think about it, it reflects the quality of the consoles better. Most things that are popular just flat out suck. They get watered down for conformity and commercial success reasons. Garbage bands like Poison, Motley Crue, KoRn, Blink 182, 50 Cent, Ashlee Simpson and Fall Out Boy become popular and sell like crazy, while real artists like The Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart, and My Bloody Valentine are doomed to toil in obscurity. In high school, the superficial preps take center stage at the proms and footballs games, while the nerds, goths and theatre kids are deemed ""weird"" by everyone else. Wal-Mart acts as a gigantic black hole toward smaller, more honest businesses, sucking them up, and not giving them a fighting chance. It works the exact same way with video games, so that should tell you which consoles have the real games.

To it's credit, XBOX does have Shenmue II (the release of the US version on the Dreamcast was cancelled), Panzer Dragoon Orta, Ninja Gaiden, and Metal Slug 3 as exclusives, which are all great. Also, the ability to save your game without a memory card is an excellent idea. Because of these 2 factors, I've bumped the rating up a half a star.

Gaming fans, save your money and get a PS2 or a Dreamcast instead. Or you could just wait for the next generation to arrive. It's not that far off by this point."
374612,2,"Have '09' '11' and '13'.  This is a piece of trash compared to the first three and a terrible step backwards.  There is little information of what equipment does, or on what equipment it will work.  Some Tipper Trailers won't fit under pipes on equipment.  Some equipment requires larger tractors which is trial or error. You can connect multiple trailers in a train so you either haul small tippers to market, or haul to the silos then use a bigger tipper to get the product to market.  The logging feature is good, but can still be rather slow and cumbersome to operate.
One huge terrible design is trees and buildings are located so close to the fields the equipment gets hung up at the ends of the rows.  Hired help constantly get caught up in every field I've tried and it slows things down unless you're constantly on alert.  You can help by buying a chain saw and sawing the trees down, then buy a large tractor with a bucket loader and push the trees away from the fields.
One favorable feature is the fertilizer sprayer let you use hired help in 15, which is nice, but the really small tippers for harvesting really keep you running.
Overall '13' gets 5 stars, 15 gets '2'.  I'm really sorry I bought this version, but I won't buy another Giant game if they don't fix this one."
34977,2,"The most tedious, time consuming mess I've ever played.  EverCrack fans will love it.  I hate it.

The bad:

Huge zone load times, same poor net code as EQ1, terrible graphics, boring quests, spelling errors, bad NPC acting. The game frustrates and is tedious.  Your forced to use online resources to locate things.

The good:

Really great animations.  Nice interface.  Great sound.  Neat spell effects.

Recommendation:

Game is not for everyone, definitely not for me.  If you have huge holes in your social life, might as well fill it with EQ2 - that's what they made this game for."
111595,2,I guess if you have a young child that wants to learn a language this is an alright resource. It is mostly disjointed memorization that rarely builds on itself. I didn't expect this to be magical or better than Rosetta Stone or Pimsleur but it really isn't worth it beyond the initial use. Maybe a small child would get more out of it just to introduce them to the concept of language studies.
397066,2,"It looks so pretty, the sound design is perfect, but there isn't much here in terms of value.

I'm 32 and was raised on star wars. I love the lore and the movies. By and large, the games have been pretty bad with the exception of few. This game isn't among the worst but it could've been a lot more. It has the look, it has the feel, it has the sound - on those aspects this game shines. That being said, WTF happened to the game play? Where is the legit progression system? Why are the offerings here so thin? DICE made battlefield which has a lot more depth than this and I would expect more from them.

The kicker here is the season pass. Spend $60, a total of $120, to get the full game... I'm tired of this kind of garbage from EA. We get incomplete games at full retail that look pretty but that's about it. I sunk about 10 hours into this and traded it in.

It's a pretty, shiny turd wearing a stormtrooper helmet. It isn't worth the $60 to me. Rent it before you buy it. You'll experience all there is to offer in a weekend. Then you can make an informed decision. It may be your thing.

Surprisingly enough, black ops 3 is a blast and I'm no ""fanboy"" of that franchise.

74213,2,"The wireless adapter does what it is supposed to, but man are we getting ripped off by Microsoft or what?

I'm barely in the beginning of part 1 and I just don't like it.  I've played other games in the ""Tales of"" series, but this has to be my least favorite."
22752,2,"I can't believe this game was rated so high by others.  I think it's an awful game, totally boring, and I regret purchasing it.  It failed to hold my interest. I quit playing after the first boss.  A horror/mystery fan, I bought it hoping it would be similar to Resident Evil 4, but it's not even close.  A young girl goes around and gets attacked by ghosts. She has no weapon other than holy water and quickly gets panicked into death.  Her movements are awkward. The battles are awkward.  The graphics aren't very good and the game is not challenging.  I feel that the game wasn't developed as well as it could have been, and overall, I'd say it was disappointing.  I suggest that you rent it before you buy it."
41435,2,"First off the good things. The game is very involved. Graphics are fantastic. Depth of game is second to none. OK, now the bad stuff. Lose the incessant chatter of the announcers. Its the same stuff every game. (Do you want to be reminded every game that Marquis Grissom's dad named him after a car he was working on?)Half of their babble about the play of the game is actually wrong. Secondly, AI needs major work. Runners will go with the pitch much too often, especially on short pop flies that you know will caught. Baserunning is near to impossible to control. I've had a situation occur several times where I end up with two runners on one base. Guess what? You can't make just one runner move. So they both go and there's a double(triple)play. I've played 14 games, using ""easy"" batting control on rookie mode. I've been no-hit 4 times and have homered once. The instruction manual is less than incomplete. It gives NO instructions on how to hit properly, field correctly, or run the bases. I've played HH2004. Its exactly the same as 2003, and I mean exactly, with the sole exception of updated rosters. But at least I can hit. I'll be playing High Heat from now on. I'll use the All-Star 2004 disk as a coaster for my beer. Acclaim should be ashamed of producing such a failure."

346330,2,"My perspective for this review: I have played every Trials game...and I have loved them all.  Because of my loyalty I bought Trials Fusion for the Xbox One without thinking twice...and without doing any research...and as things turn out this was a mistake and I now feel cheated and ripped off (actually going to see if I can get my money back even though it was a digital download).  My issues so far with the game: 1) It doesn't feel quirky, cool and funny like the previous Trials games...now it feels kinda stiff and goofy.  2) Trials Fusion is an unfinished game...several features don't work...they show up in the menus, but say ""coming soon""...this is LAME. 3) There is NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER...and the developers have the nerve to say that people didn't use multiplayer...well my friends and I loaded up online multiplayer races all the time and had a blast...no online multiplayer is VERY VERY LAME. 4) The career is ok...but just ok...the events go from too easy to very hard without much middle ground.  5) There is a +$5 Xbox One surcharge...this should still be a $15 game, but they are now charging $20...and for an incomplete game.  Overall I am just really disappointed with this game...sad to see it go downhill like this and lose its heritage and fun factor...also sad to see it was rushed to market without being finished.  Save your money for now..."
105999,2,"I usually don't bother to write reviews, but this game was too disappointing to let go.

I'll keep this short: graphics are very good. I loved Far Cry, and the first half of Crysis was indeed Far Cry with more eye candy.

Pros: Great Graphics - texture features, explosions, etc.  Also: no Steam-esqe account joining or on-line activation! Just load and play. Keep it that way: game developers!

Cons: Many -- bugs here and there, including the big one that stopped the game for good -- shooting the 'big boss' on the carrier -- gun would not 'target'.  'Had to quit...I'm assuming that was the end :-(

WORSE: story line was DULL!  Shooting thingies that looked like those in Matrix over and over again got downright boring.  Far Cry was immersive and compelling -- with so many interesting and even 'scary' chapters... and gameplay that lasted seemingly days.  Crysis does not deliver in those ways.  AI was bland and fairly unintelligent.

Again, this is a short review.  Perhaps I'm getting too old for PC games -- but compared with Half Life, Unreal 2, and even the earlier Dooms 1 & 2 all of which I found 'compelling' and creative, Crysis falls short... almost flat.  -s"
386261,2,"I've been a massive fan of Street Fighter since SFII in the arcade. I played online and in local tournaments. I loved the progression, the variance, and the evolution of the series.

SFV is a massive step backwards for the franchise. The focus on post-purchase player monetization is simply too aggressive given how incomplete the title is. Capcom is still, essentially, beta testing new players on the backs of the die-hard fans playing online. As of August, 2016, the game still lacks an arcade mode, the single player ""story mode"" is an atrocity, and online matches tend to hover in the range of 8-15 frames of delay for most matches.

Whereas SFIV introduced a lot of fun new mechanics, SFV reduces and removes, limiting player options, and making play fundamentally less interesting. All this combined with online match wait times that often exceed the length of a match make this game a real disappointment.

As a matter of personal preference, I think the graphics in SFV are also really disappointing. When you can compare SF to the Aksys games like BlazBlue and Guilty Gear, the SFV graphics are just laughable. The texture maps are low res, some of the character modeling is nothing short of goofy (not even just the SF style - I mean truly badly designed characters with misshapen faces, etc.), weird edge case animation issues, etc., plague the game. The PS4 and PC versions of SFV look like something you'd expect to see on an Xbox 360 or PS3."
227869,2,Had this for about a week and the toslink has finally given out. I got this specifically for not having to plug and unplug that cable so now I have to do it again. Hdmi works and it was great while it lasted.
178296,2,"I'm actually enjoying this game for the most part.  It's a pretty classy act and I don't have much to add to what others have said in that department.  I was really disappointed with the combat system, general controls and lack of moral choices though.

Your character cannot jump move side to side or back up.  Even if a small obstacle is in your way, you have to go around it.  You can't even step over it.  How realistic is that?  A young warrior in his prime has to walk around things like an old man because he can't jump or step over it.

As a mage using ranged attacks, if an enemy is coming at you, you can't even back up or move side to side in order to stay away.  The ""s"" key just makes you turn around and run the other direction.  The ""a"" and ""d"" keys make you run left or right.  Any movement one does other than straight forward causes one to face away from the enemy and one can't cast while doing that.  So if you get rushed, you either have to stand your ground and melee, or run away.  So I have a character that I cannot play as I thought I could.  This causes lots of frustration for me.  I will have to go back and create a melee class character instead, and even then I will not be able to play him in a realistic manner.

I also didn't like running into spots where ones only choices in action were morally ambiguous  This does not leave one any option to play your character as completely honorable, without compromise, like a paladin for instance.  One can only play as morally corrupt or middle of the road.  For an RPG this is not a lot of options

Real disappointing.

Amendment:  Well I finally gave up on this game.  I just couldn't get past the poor controls.  I enjoyed the cut scenes and the interactions with the NPCs, but having to wade through mobs with the awkward combat system was just too frustrating for me.  My son really likes the game though, so at least I don't feel it was a total waste of my money.

I really did want to love this title.  I heard so many people talking about how immersive it was, but I was reminded constantly that I was playing a game because of its linear nature and poor controls.  Oblivion was immersive.  Fallout 3 was immersive.  Dragon Age Origins reminded me constantly that I was just playing a game.."
145469,2,"I agree with the reviewers that were disappointed after reading some of the other reviews on here.  While some of the graphics / controls are pretty good, there's really not that much to keep your attention for very long.  The downhill skiing is lots of fun, but even that will wear on you after a while.  I can't really figure out when to ""lean"" vs. ""turn"" in the 4-man bobsled/2-woman bobsled/skeleton/luge (essentially the same thing, but I seem to be better at some than others, for some reason, presumably because you need to lean in some, where others you can just turn, as I've been doing).  Similarly the ski-jumping (both regular and big-hill) are pretty cool, but I find little guidance in how to land properly, other than not having crashed after the fact.  What you've basically got in the skiing & luge game are rudimentary driving games, but with fewer graphics.

Definitely worth a rental, because it does afford some fun for a while, but unfortunately it quickly loses its appeal.  Before you spend the money, it's worth checking out a ""professional"" review on this one -- I found them to be more extensive and spot on.  Unfortunately, I didn't read them until after I read reviews here and bought it."
22918,2,"Many have already written on this game, so I'll try to avoid repeating what they've said, but ultimately, this game starts out strong and entertaining enough, but settles into a middle-ground groove that's neither bad, nor great, but not all too awe-inspiring as the game goes on.
The voice actor for Indiana Jones is passable, but not too convincing -- you can tell it's not Harrison Ford.
And unsurprisingly, it dusts off the long-lived stereotype of the dragon lady and at the end, Indiana gets the Asian (i.e. Chinese) girl, even though there's no plausible reason for her to have any sort of feelings for him -- she's little more than a toy doll for him to have his way with.
The ending is dull -- both the final boss battle and the ending cinematic are little reward for having ran, swung, punched and kicked your way through level after level, trap after trap.
Good if you're an Indiana Jones fan, but others should either rent or stay away altogether."

32479,2,"Being a ""Tycoon""/Sim Fan, I figured to ignore the warnings of other bad reviews and got this game. I like malls and shopping, I  love sims, so how bad could it be?...ya, its pretty bad.
The graphics, although apparantly take a lot of system resources to run, remind me of the old Nintendo/Arcade game ""paperboy"". The movement and detail of the characters are about the same and look very underdeveloped.
The game does have a lot of potential. There is a large variety of stores, products, and decorations you can select from to build several floors worth of mall. However, the purpose and goals of the game are vague. The in-game help and descriptions are limited and the play is not as user-friendly as other games in this genre. There is plenty of ""scenerios"" to play, but I have yet to win or lose one and not sure how to. You do have control of the store names and some details, but there is no control or details about the customers that roam your mall.
After playing this for a bit, I decided to go back to playing ""Sims:Hot Date"", where I could build shops and enjoy a game with some purpose.
Overall, with Mall Tycoon, I feel like I'm playing a beta version of a game and want the final product that I was hoping for."
398242,2,"One word: over-hyped. After reading all of the positive reviews, I took a chance on this game and was sorely disappointed. You're dropped into the middle of a story and never quite sure what exactly is going on. If you're familiar with these games, I suppose it won't be a problem but for a new player, it's a bit overwhelming.

Then, for all the way the manual makes the player character out to be some sort of bad-ass fighter, you are SO under-powered in this game. Entry level enemies can and will kill you with ease.

I got tired of it, and traded it in."
422214,2,"it's much too narrow to fit your hand comfortably. You have to sort of squeeze it with your palm, which gets very uncomfortable. I wanted to like it, but had to return it because my it made my hand sore after a while. Why couldn't they just make it regular sized?"
71598,2,"when I first turned on Regeneration and saw the graphics I was very impressed and thought this was going to be a step forward from Fistful of Boomstick. Some of the scenery was done very well.  But unfortunately, they seemed to have spent so much time making the game look good, they forgot to make actual play equally as exciting.
Regeneration starts off in the cabin in the woods. It was good to be back there and I was excited to see they brought the story line back to the creepy cabin. But just as you're getting into it, that level is quickly over. It was more like an intro. So you then find yourself in a mental institution that became possessed and over run with deadites. Perfect! what more could you ask for that a creepy hospital building? well, again, before you know it the level is over and you're out of there. Having not done much at all. The line of travel is mostly limited to one hallway. you never get to search out and find hidden areas and objects. No challenging puzzles or objects to find and later use someplace else like in ""Boomstick"". It's very simplistic and quickly over. what a let down. This seems to happen throughout the game. Although I will admit as the game went further on, it did improve slightly. But it just wasn't challenging. The game constantly tells you what to do and never lets you figure things out on your own. You walk near an elevator, the triangle icon appears on screen and tells you to push the button. Never letting you figure anything out on your own. There are so many cinematic cut scenes that you're constantly watching the game like a movie and waiting to actually play. There aren't as many interesting weapons to pick up as you go along either. Some of the execution cut scenes are cool when killing deadites, but over all, I was let down by the lack of challenge of this game. The Sam character ( voiced terribly by Ted Raimi ) is just horrible and makes game play annoying at times. Picture Scrappy Doo doing a Joe Pesci imitation. But so completely typical and over the top. Just not funny at all.  When you're controlling Sam in certain scenes, the music that comes on is just silly cartoonish music that doesn't fit with the scary theme of the game at all. Almost points out how stupid and unfitting the character is in this game.  I love the Evil Dead movies and enjoy Bruce Campbells character and voice over a lot. But believe it or not, the earlier, more simplistic looking ""Fistful Of Boomstick"" was much more enjoyable. Hopefully they'll make some major improvements to actual game play the next time they take a shot at the Evil Dead series. And take a lesson from terrible characters like Scrappy Doo and Jar Jar Binks. Don't bother. Skip them entirely."

I have created 6 profiles now and finished all 6 of them, including not counting a win unless I won fast money.  I wish they could have made it more difficult, or make rounds you can unlock as you go on.  The incentive for the free hair and clothing doesn't make the game any more exciting to play."
317796,2,"I tried to love this game, I really did. The thing is, Elder Scrolls just doesn't transfer well to a MMO. ES should be a central hub and only group with party's of 2+ based on missions. Let the main story be solo.

Instead, you are in same dunguens.and.dragons as dozens more so you have to fight for mobs, or in many cases, just walk through without a fight to finish a quest. Speaking of quests, 90% of the quests involve you finding something, doing something with it, and returning it. That or killing something. Not as entertaining as other MMO quests or even traditional ES games. The story is pretty much non existant. Graphics are outdated and laggy. Feels like mid quality XBOX 360 game.

Controls are clumsy. Voice over are mostly non existant. Character growth is below standard and to park with traditional ES games.

Finally, unless you have friends already who have the game, good luck trying to form a party. In game chat is something you have to actually select. It is worthless because no one uses it. There is also no text chat. This makes things more frustrating.

Other than those gripes.....yeah Just don't get it. Best thing about it is that it's free to play. But the game is not even worth the 35$ I paid."
32686,2,"The Dragon Ball Z cartoon series features awsome looking anime characters rapidly punching each other at 100ft in the air while flying at super human speeds and shooting out devestating exploding beams of god knows what. This game dosnt. This game has clunky piles of pixels that barely ever show any raid movement for characters, Two different attacks that all take time to charge up and can only be shot one at a time, 1 basic punch move, A main character that walks as if he broke his legs during a horrible standing accident, and background tunes that sound like what shrank your ears back in the days of NES. There are some neat anime senes in there sometimes, but still have the horrible background music blaring along with it. There are some moments with corny one-liners audio clips from the show but force you to look at the mudpuddle of a screen while listing to them. The graphics do feature some items and places that look alot like their anime counterparts in the show, but have a horrible looking ground of dots of sand/dirt color under them. The sound is also so bad, ... Come on? You can put more effort into games than that! This could have easily been done on a Game Boy Color. There are no pro's I can say here. I don't understand how anybody can like this game. You trudge slowly through the terrain in the four cardinal directions, no diagnols, and shoot anything thats behind, in front of, or on your left or right sides. Dont buy this. Dont even bother to illegally download it for free or go to the trouble of even thinking of it. I should have said only that this whole time. Other than my complaing, thanks for reading through my complaing!"
48157,2,"When you play, it takes 1 sec after you press the button for the action to respond. There are no special moves, no special effects, you'd find yourself doing the same stunts over and over again. There's really no variety of enemies, overall this game is only worth a dollar."

251248,2,"Take a look at Zap. He looks cool, doesn't he? A little blue dragon with big horns, wearing some kinda scuba suit- that's certainly a cool design. But when you start to use the guy in Skylanders, it's clear that Zap's going to need a heck of a lot of stat upgrades to be of much use. What really bites is that Gill Grunt, one of the Skylanders that comes with the game, outclasses Zap in every possible way. Who would've guessed that about what most would assume is a lower level character? I think Zap and Gill Grunt should've switched roles, with Gill Grunt being the one available in character packs or on his own.

It's hard to say much good about Zap apart from the design. The one thing he has going for him is speed. Zap is very fast, with one of his moves being a 'sea slime' move that propels him forward, leaving a trail of slime behind that stuns and damages enemies. This will be your main way of getting around because it's so quick, and navigating through levels is a breeze.

And that about does it for the pros! What's so bad about Zap, you might be asking? While I did say in my review of the Skylanders game that there's no such thing as a bad Skylander...that every one is good in their own way, I still stand by that. But compared to all the others, Zap is at the bottom of the barrel. His two main powers are a lightning bolt shock that he can shoot, and the sea slime rush. The lightning bolts are incredibly weak and only worth using if you choose to upgrade this attack as fast as possible. If you're in an area with a lot of enemies, there's a good chance that by the time you've killed one of them, the others will have ganged up on you. Your best bet is to slide around with the sea slime move while shooting or play tag with the enemies. Zap's unique move that makes use of the circle button on the ps3, is basically the same thing as the sea slime move, but with a water shield in front of Zap that lets him attempt to plow through enemies. Of all the things they could've given him...this was the best they could do. Great. On top of this, Zap has very lower HP, making him prone to dying quickly by those enemies or obstacles that hit repeatedly. Finally, his Soul Gem ability lets him recover HP while in water. Yeah, I'm sure that'll come in handy for all those levels that don't have a whole lot of water.

But if you go through all of the Challenges to boost Zap's stats as far as they can go, he can be a pretty decent character. That's if you're willing to invest the time though. If you're looking for another water type, I'd suggest any of the others instead."

316328,2,Boring.
366705,2,Didn't care for the game...not anything like other FF titles.
80494,2,"Where do I even begin for this one? Final Fantasy XII is the only Final Fantasy I haven't finished. I managed to get in about 50 hours of gameplay, and even with that investment I think I'm still only halfway through the story.

Which reminds me, where is the story in this game? This is the first time I played a FF game where I honestly can't even remember what it's about. I tried picking up where I left of some time ago, only to give up in frustration again. The characters are about as boring as they come. Vaan, the protagonist, is a whiny teenage boy (what a surprise..) who is rebelling about something, and he wants to be a pirate, and he's pissed about some stuff, and the other people in the party are angry about something too, though you wouldn't really know it since they appear to have no emotions whatsoever. The dialogue, which is hidden somewhere between the endless monster grinding and side-questing, is about as bland as natural flavored oatmeal. There are no witty one-liners, there are no heated debates, they just tend to walk along stating facts, making dreary comments about the socio-political problems of their world. If I wanted that, I would watch C-SPAN, not play a video game.

What this game really lacks, and desperately needed, was a bad guy. Oh there's some Prince or whatever who's manipulative and sneaky, but it's so dull. Bad guys need to be bad, they need to have an evil laugh, you need to see them torch a village to the ground so you can hate them and want them to die. FFXII has villains, but they're not interesting, there's no drama, there's no excitement or anything.

The gameplay is really contradictory, the battle system has you auto attacking for basically 80% of all battles. Then there's about 200 different macros, or gambits, that you can make to help make the game even more dull! But wait, it's not gonna be that simple, you have to find all of the gambit parts first, oh and if you want to cast spells, you have to first buy the spell, and then learn the talent for it. That wouldn't be so bad if the spell buying system wasn't so completely frustrating. Oh you want this spell? Sorry this store doesn't carry it, but you could go past a dozen loading screens and check the other store, which probably doesn't have it either. Which brings me to another point: loading screens. My god this game is absolutely plagued by them. The maps for all the towns and places are divided into dozens of sub-sections. Getting to the sewers in the main city will probably mean you need to get through 5 or 6 loading screens. And I hope to god you have all the maps memorized, you don't want to have to look them up, since getting to the map where you're at will require you to load about 5 screens because when you bring up the map, you start completely zoomed out instead of zoomed in.

This game just goes out of its way to frustrate people. And no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get past how badly it was made. The soundtrack is so dull, it's lacks any sort of emotion or creativity. I usually buy soundtracks ahead of time, because FF music is always worth it. Well it wasn't for this one, it sounded like a regurgitation of the FFT:A soundtrack.

All in all there's about a hundred RPGs I'd recommend for play before this one. If you missed this title and are afraid you're missing out on something then don't worry, this game is something you can miss without regret."
175544,2,"I totally get what they're going for, trying to imitate the old grindhouse horror movie feel, with over the top violence and language, etc. The problem is they take it way too far to the point where it stops being a charming throwback and starts being extremely annoying. Cut scenes go on forever and the joke of the characters sticking swears into every sentence really gets old quick. It wouldn't matter as much if they'd let you SKIP the cut scenes, but for some reason you can't do that until you've watched them at least once.

Long story short, this is a really fun game that trips over its own feet when attempting to be amusing. It's cute, but not nearly as funny as it thinks it is and you find yourself just waiting for the unbearable cut scenes to END so you can get back to shooting stuff. Maybe it's better once you've played through once and can skip the cut scenes, but on the first play through, waiting to get back to shooting is agonizing."
455008,2,"there's a love and hate relationship that i have with this game the first thing that i feel like a problem is its stamina meter thats never been in any tomb raider game before and never been in it ever again. it becomes a pain when u climb from one side to another there isn't any button to speed up movements on ledges and stamina meter goes out to fast but there is a mechanic when u pull or push something it increases stamina meter timer but i think that feature is a bad idea to add also stealth becomes useless after they introduce that feature in the beginning of the game i think its well thought ideas thats added into to the game like candy bars that can full your health bar but the targeting is so bad that in pc version fans made a mod to not only fixed that issue but also awful glitches and bugs that others had experience while playing this game. the story and character interact is the only things that feels well done  with a unique theme but again gameplay just ruined it which led a potential trilogy scrapped and development of the franchise was transferred to Crystal Dynamics for the next entry in the series, Tomb Raider: Legend.
also the debut to a new character name kurtis is bad only bcuz the new weapon that u see only in cutscenes he cant use during gameplay and  there's certain levels where enemies was supposed to attack but never does ,sprint button is pretty much useless, limited inventory, way too many variety of health items but not enough of everything else

warning #Spoiler: Angel of Darkness follows on from events in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider Chronicles, where Lara Croft was presumed dead. An unspecified time later, Lara arrives in Paris at the request of her former mentor, Werner Von Croy, who mentions that he has been tasked by a man named Eckardt to track medieval icons known as the Obscura Paintings. The city, and Von Croy, are gripped with fear over a serial killer the press have dubbed the ""Monstrum"". The Monstrum steals body parts and leaves distinctive signs made with the victims blood in its wake. During a confrontation with Von Croy at his apartment, a flurry of activity occurs and Lara is knocked unconscious. When she wakes, she discovers Von Croy dead, apparently having been murdered by the Monstrum, and Lara becomes the prime suspect. Fleeing his demise & running away from the cops, Lara tracks down Von Croy's friend Margot Carvier in her apartment building who agrees to give Lara Von Croy's old notebook, which he had left with her for safekeeping. Carvier reveals to Lara how Von Croy had been contracted by Eckhardt to track the Obscura Paintings while adding details on how he had been fearful doing the job. The next day, a local Parisian prostitute reveals to Lara that Carvier has also been murdered by the Monstrum. Shortly before his death, Von Croy had been in contact with a well-known French businessman and secret underworld figure Louis Bouchard. Lara must track down Bouchard through the almost-deserted backstreets of Paris, discovering from locals that Bouchard went into hiding after the death of several of his associates by the Monstrum. When she does locate him, Bouchard reveals Von Croy had contacted him for assistance in breaking into an archaeological dig beneath the Muse du Louvre. Lara gains access to the Louvre through its storm drains, and is able to uncover more information connecting the archaeological dig to the Obscura Paintings. The paintings, which originally depicted demonic imagery, concern the Nephilim, a hybrid creature descended from angels and humans, which once lived in Anatolia. A single dormant Nephilim now remains, the Cubiculum Nephili or ""Sleeper"". The five Obscura Paintings, when connected, form a talisman called the Sanglyph that can be used to revive the Sleeper. To prevent this, an ancient society of warrior Christian monks called the Lux Veritatis was formed and they successfully stopped Eckhardt and his order known as the Cabal by trapping him using three daggers known as Periapt Shards, which can destroy any immortal being. The Lux Veritatis leader known as Brother Obscura seized the paintings, and painted religious imagery over the evil ones and hid them, one of which is in a guarded vault beneath the Louvre. The society also created copies of the paintings known as Obscura Engravings, all of which has an encoded map that leads to the locations of the original paintings.
Lara must descend into the Lux Veritatis stronghold beneath the Louvre to retrieve it. While attempting to escape from the Louvre with the painting, Lara is disarmed by Kurtis Trent, the last living member of the Lux Veritatis, who wields a magical Chirugai blade. Kurtis steals the painting, but both he and Lara are knocked unconscious before they can flee. Upon regaining consciousness, Lara is met by Bouchard, who informs her of a Monstrum killing in Prague, the victim being Mathias Vasiley, an art dealer and historian whom Von Croy exchanged information of the Obscura Engravings. Bouchard then betrays Lara, attempting to have her killed, but Lara survives and makes her way to the Czech Republic. In an upper-class town square in Prague, Lara meets a Czech journalist named Thomas Luddick, who fills her in on Eckhardt, revealed to be an immortal black alchemist who leads a mysterious local organization called the Cabal, and whom Luddick believes is the Monstrum. Lara also encounters a captive Bouchard near the crime scene, who reveals Eckhardt's full plan for reviving the Nephilim. Soon after, Lara rediscovers Bouchard dead. With Luddick's assistance, Lara infiltrates the Cabal's headquarters, the Strahov, and in the process accidentally frees the Proto-Nephilim, the Cabal's unsuccessful attempt to breed a new Nephilim species. Meanwhile, Lara witnesses Eckhardt murder Luddick. She again encounters Kurtis, who locks her in a compartment while he kills the Proto-Nephilim using two Periapt Shards. After an exchange of information, Lara and Kurtis team up to stop Eckhardt assembling the Sanglyph, with Lara retrieving the final Obscura Painting buried deep beneath the Strahov. However, Lara must surrender this painting to save Kurtis, after he is captured by Eckhardt. Kurtis gives Lara his Periapt shards, but she will need a third lost shard to defeat Eckhardt, which Eckhardt has hidden in his laboratory. While Lara flees to track this shard down, Kurtis attempts to hold off an attack from Boaz, the horribly mutated remains of a fallen Cabal member. Kurtis succeeds in killing her, but is severely wounded in the process. After retrieving the final Periapt shard, Lara discovers Eckardt in the midst of attempting to revive the Sleeper, using the Sanglyph and body parts stolen from the Monstrum's victims. She is able to stab him with two shards, but before she can deliver the final blow, she is interrupted by Eckhardt's right-hand man, Karel. Karel kills Eckhardt with the final shard, revealing that he is a Nephilim himself, and had used Eckhardt to ensure the survival of his species. He had also manipulated Lara, in the guise of Bouchard, Luddick and Kurtis, to retrieve the Obscura Paintings. He offers Lara immortality if she will help him complete the task, but Lara experiences a flashback to Von Croys murder, and sees that Karel, in Eckhardt's form, was the Monstrum. She refuses, retrieves the Sanglyph from Eckhardt's body, and plants it on the Sleeper, overloading it with energy and causing it to explode

OverAll

Negatives :climbing meter goes out to fast stopping player to progress, killing off a debut character, sloppy gameplay and controls, bad additional features, awful targeting system, terrible A.I.'s , good ideas thats poorly executed

Positives : interacting with all characters with a telltale open world feel, changing story based of your decisions, presentation- unique sounds and excellent storyline plot, polished textures of environments and characters"
438705,2,an abomination of football. i found this game in a trash bin next to the ole schoolsy woolsy. its known as trash bin #6. on the east side of Parkway George. So i looks it home and it played well. i was the Austin dallas team and i was playing against the blue team. i forget the name. the Tall boys. so like 5 minutes later the game froze. it make me mad. i took some old epoxy and filled in the cracks and it worked better. but the genesis bugs are a lot. they ruin gameplay. so many titular examples of overbearing policies in regards to the pay to play micro transactions. i have to pay more to play what i paid no money to play because i found it in the bins. but most people have to pay for trading cards. i usually just go to walmart and buy the tops pack. it comes with the gum. better deal than this. game was ok for the bargain bin but every other spy has claimed poor codes. so i say no more poor codes. i demand a combo platter.
177892,2,I have a couple hundred games in my collection and this is not one of the best but since I never pay more than $20 for a game I had to give this one a chance when the price hit 18. I enjoyed the game in PS2 and thought this would be as good but--not. The story line was good which gets it a 2 star but after about an hour I had to move on on to something more interesting so now having a ball with Mercenaries2 World In Flames.
67505,2,"This game does not feels or plays like a shinning force game.  Yes the original ones might been tactics based but it was the animated attack screens, the battle music, the side quest that made the series so popular.  I don't like neo or new it is boring you have to read a lot and listen to the voice overs at the same time, too bad.  This should have been called side quest or virtua quest (another big flop).  I would not even rent it."
259387,2,"I was so excited to hear that SH3 was being released.  I fired up Steam and downloaded it then jumped in to play some scenarios but wow, this is pathetic.

Pros
--Graphics - What can I say other than they look really good.  I love the 3D models and the voice acting brings back so many memories.  ""Morning Your Lordship"" never gets old.

--Castles - The placement of buildings is much more intuitive as you can rotate a building 360 degrees and place it however you want.  However those annoying peasants still get in the way sometimes.  If they're standing/walking where you want to place a building, you can't do it.  I hoped this annoying ""feature"" would have been resolved.

That's about all the positives I can see right now other than it's an updated version of the old game I used to love.

Cons
Man there are plenty to go around here.  That's why I'm only giving this 2 stars and I thought about 1 star but I enjoy this series so much and in fairness I haven't spent a tremendous amount of time playing the game yet.

--Pathing - Some of my army got stuck on nothing.  I issued an order to move to a certain area and they couldn't get there.  I tried issuing orders for them to move away from a building, they would acknowledge the move order, turn in the direction of the move then just sit there.  ARRGGGHHH

--Combat - Numerous times an enemy would be fighting my guys and they wouldn't do anything.  When I selected a squad, then right clicked on an enemy to have them attack, they would acknowledge the order but would sit there as their fellow soldiers got killed and wouldn't attack.  The only way to get them to attack was to issue a move order and then they would start moving, then realize there was an enemy and attack.  It was like they were sleeping or something.  Stupid peasants!

--Cut Scenes - Really?  Sketch drawings for cut scenes?  REALLY?  Oh man, they aren't even colored just pen an paper drawings with some blood splattered across them to give them more life.  Now I could easily forgive this as an artistic choice if the game play was more solid because let's be honest, if the gameplay rocks, who cares about the cut scenes right?

--Scoring Screen - After the first mission, the score screen popped up and there were only empty square boxes where it was counting up my score.  The score in the box actually read 0.  This was totally unfinished, unpolished and perhaps even untested.

Now I love the Stronghold series and I really hope Firefly Studios fixes things.  They've got a good start to a game.  I would even go so far as to say they have an excellent start to a game but you can't have something this unpolished released as a final game and gone are the days where consumers will accept this garbage as a finished product.  This isn't 2001, it's 2011.  It's time to update your business model Firefly as there are plenty of examples of companies that put quality first....not revenues.

To those of you on the fence about this, I would suggest waiting unless you don't mind being a paying beta tester.  In a month, this game will be on the used game shelves for $10 - it's really that bad.  It's so terribly disappointing that a once great series has a release like this."
123532,2,i didn't like it... so i went for deathstalker
41530,2,"This game was on my top 10 wish list for games I wanted. I could not wait for it to come out. Now that I have it, how dissappointing it was.
When I first got Lords of the Realms 2, I played it the first day for 15 staight hours. It was my first taste of real time strategy and started my conversion from puzzle games to RTS and FPS games. With Realms 3, it took all of the good things from Realms 2 and got rid of them. You can no longer control the resources you collect like rock, trees, and your food. You now place a vassal on a vacant plot and you get either gold or food. Thats it. You also can't raise an army. The only way you can get an army is to place a Knight on a vacant plot or buy mercanaries. But if you don't own enough land, you can only have so many Knights or you will not have enough money or farms. If you are short on farms, your army will abandon you. The longer your Knight is on the board, the more men he will collect, but it takes a very long time to collect a very small amount of men. You used to be able to control your lands easier and make your city grow, then raise an army. But not now.
The most irritating thing is fighting. If you go to an enemies lands and take out his farm, if you don't leave an army back, they will instantly place another vassal for a farm. Even if you take out their castle, you still can't take over their land until you do more damage to their land.
The next irritating thing is the armies. You can kill all of the enemies armies which leaves his plot open. He will then place another Knight to replace his beaten Knight and then attack you and somehow he has an army twice your size. I beat one enemies Knights completely 3 straight times and he still came back with 2 large armies and force me from his land. Not sure how that happened as I went through every Knight of the Realm and never found a large army once. When an army takes damage, their color changes. When they get to red, they are discouraged and they disband during the fight. So how he can keep coming back is beyond me becasue your army needs time to heal.
And the last irritating thing is the battles. It seems like every time I go to the battle screen, another army attacks my lands. That is because there is no pause in the game when try to fight the battles yourself. If you let the computer do it for you, you lose alot more than you should plus you don't get to play the game. There needs to be a pause during battles so you can enjoy the game more. You also can't build siege weapons. You have buy siege mercanaries. Not cooll at all.
The games doesn't totally suck. It is challenging (although very repititious) and the graphics are pretty good (although I haven't been able to see the intro movie or any other cutscenes even thought I downloaded the patch. not sure whats up with that), but that is about it.
If they plan on making another, they better go back to what worked for Realms 2 & 3 and incorporate it in Realms 4, otherwise this franchise is dead if it isn't already."
223935,2,"WHAT did EA do to this version of Shift 2 for PC?  This could have been the best game ever, however; they completely left out the AA feature.  Looks like #&^$ and I have an Evga Nvidia 570 with a Core I7 2400k processor.  Jagged edges EVERYWHERE overlaid with this morphing effect like blurriness over the entire screen.  Someone said you have to download Nvidia Inspector or something like that and force triple buffering and vsync, bla bla bla. That's crap.  I shouldn't have to do all that for a PC game running on an up to date system.  EA DROPPED THE BALL, plain and simple.  I'll just go back to Shift 1.  And the XBOX version is EXACTLY the same!!!"
334765,2,"Say no to Diablocraft!  It disappointed me that Blizzard took content from WoW and weaved it into a ""new"" game.  It has been a ""been there, done that,"" kind of experience for me.

I'm not even sure what I expected from Blizzard. I was hoping to have been wowed by a new game, but instead I was WoWed in a bad way.  Blizzard still puts out stunning cinematics, but they have lost all integrity when it comes to creating original games, and are now cashing in on old content and concepts.

If you have played WoW and are looking to steer clear of that kind of game, then I can't recommend it to you.  If you have never played WoW or Diablo 2, then you may find this game rewarding instead of disappointing."
397114,2,"The graphics are top notch and sound is amazing. The Gameplay is limited fun and I think showing friends will be cool. After having this now for two days and about a day of gameplay, it's already gotten old. The fun of the game has dulled away and has left an vacant space In the room of replayability that will probably be filled with another game currently owned or one soon to be purchased. I'll probably keep it, but this won't be the game I will recommend to friends to pick up and play together with, not untiL it drops to the $20 or $30 range.

Note: if you have kids like I do who are old enough to play this, I'll tell you now, they really don't like the online play with pvp. Can't speak for all kids, but I can say that online play is significantly more difficult.

I'm not the best player but I have also played video games for over 10 years. The trouble with online multiplayer games, which this game is, is that I often feel like I'm getting owned most of the time. There are times where I come out on top or the top in score but most of the time it's in the middle. While that's fine and its just part of the game. Online only multiplayer games are hardly as enjoyable as a campaign or playing against computer bots for the above mentioned reason, and I don't think I'm alone when I say most gamers prefer a campaign to online play any day and for more reasons."
408223,2,"I purchased this as part of the 500 GB PS4 bundle.  Frankly, it's difficult to enjoy this game due to the endless server errors.  What I've glimpsed of it in between the glitches, level resets, server kicks, and team boots is visually pretty and decently fun, like a far off land of happiness viewed through a grimy window.  Honestly, I've never seen a game this twitchy and unreliable, and I've played the Earth Defense Force games online on PS3. On the PS4, I routinely co-op with 4-16 players on highspeed Verizon Fios service and never have any connection problems -- except with Destiny.  Here, I've seen them all, as each Destiny server or network error has a helpful ""animal name"" to let you know what went wrong.  Let's say you've started a new zone with your friends.  All is well, you're blasting away, and then suddenly the screen goes black, and you respawn back at the beginning of the level all by yourself due to error code ""turtle.""  All your friends are now 10 miles away, wondering where you went and why mooks you should be fragging are now hitting them from the flank.  No worries!  You'll just start heading back up the hill towards them and -- whoops!  You're back at the beginning of the level again, this time due to error code ""monkey.""  In fact, now you can never get more than about 50 feet from the spawn point without passing out and reappearing there, something that stops being funny after the first few times.

Indeed, repeat that about 50 times, seeing different errors most of the time, and you quickly realize that Destiny is basically a militarized version of Groundhog day.  Just when you thought things were going well, the server decided you should instead relive everything you just experienced, and without the assistance of the rest of your squad.  Like Edge of Tomorrow, maybe someone killed you or you just managed to ""reset the day"" on your own.  But no matter, you at least got a funny animal name out of it.  Given that nothing even remotely like this level of instability is to be found in any other network games I play on the PS4, you have to wonder if it is intentional, something to add more challenges to what is already an interminable grind.  For me, at least, that question will forever remain unanswered, as I will never play this game again due to the frustration of losing blocks of time for no reason, and with no explanation beyond a silly animal error code.  Be warned."

182153,2,"The idea is that you have a big open map and can use that you can use any number of strategies and squad commands to keep the tactical advantage in a kind of war simulation.  Generally it is a lot of fun, and I like the idea of 1 hit kills, and injuries affecting your abilities to aim/run etc.  The poor AI and awful save system really drag it down though.

pros: The wide open maps, realistic damage and focus on strategy and spacial awareness make it a fun fresh approach to FPS gaming.

Cons: The graphics are underwhelming. The team AI is so stupid that once the player unable to command them all 3 can be easily killed off by a single enemy rifleman.  The enemy AI seems somewhat better, but they will still throw themselves into a prone position and crawl across open ground when they could have easily sprinted to nearby cover. The save system is probably the worst part about this game.  It is checkpoint based, but not every checkpoint registers a save, and combined with the one shot kills and the great distances/open map, that means A LOT of running.  You might to fight through enemy forces for 2 or 3 kilometers just to reach the objective, get shot in the face and start all over.

 Given the large amount of time it takes to play this game, I can't recommend it as a rental.  Unless they come out with an update to fix some of the issues with it I can't recommend paying full price for it either. Wait until you can find it for $15 or borrow it from a friend."
25605,2,"This Game was terrible. The only new thing about this game was that Coco was fully playable but you don't get to play as her very often anyway.

Here's an overall view of the game:

The Positives:

-Good Graphics

-Good Bosses

-New Vehicles

The Negatives:

-Sucky Levels!

-Sucky Music

-It takes about a hour to load

-The Game is extremly hard

I heard there is a new Crash coming out later this year. All I can say is that I hope it will be good."
154986,2,"The only game I play on this is the target practice game. The other games are worthless with the exception of the tanks, which is no better than any flash animation version you can play for free online. The target practice game is only good with a gun attachment of some sort. I use the Perfect Shot. I got this because it came with a Remote. This version does not, and thus, is not worth it. 2 stars because the shooting is fun, and you don't have to bother with any other game to get to it... which reminds me... you cant play ANY other game on this, until you have played the previous game on the disk. Tanks is last, so if you want to get to that you have to play the awkward ping-pong, the slow and sloppy pool, and you have to race some mentally challenged cows with clumsy controls, along with some other worthless games. Least you don't need a good score to pass them..."
75704,2,"So is anyone else wondering why Bethesda posted false requirements for this game? I can't even begin how messed up this is. I give them kudos in producing an amazing title, as well as being industry leaders for the advancement of next gen games. But it shouldnt be by ripping us off. GeForce FX series? Are you kidding me? People, please, lets make them right their wrongs. Seriously, its like buying a car that they say has an engine, and then doesnt. Completly worthless. And, I can imagine the same people who are having these problems don't have the money to invest in a next gen video card, because they asumed Bethesda as a responsible corporation would assume liability for any misleadings. Anyone with me?"

224057,2,"This is a decent hack-and-slash, and was better than I expected.  The graphics aren't so bad--they're actually very nice in parts of the game.  The button-mashing combat starts out as fun, though the customization isn't nearly as deep as the developers would have you believe by the upgrade interface; I was rarely able to get any of the dozens of combo moves to work.  When this game deviates from anything beyond mindless button-mashing, it fails--ranged attacks, quicktime events, etc.--all failures.  The ending is a complete joke--the game was longer than I thought, mostly due to the incessant cutscenes.

The voice-acting is absolutely horrible--as if they got a Shakespearean stage actor and a Latino drunk for the two main characters.  The last cutscene ends abruptly with absolutely no resolution to the drawn-out story.  I was angry when the credits rolled--all this for very little payoff, story-wise.  I think this may be the last time I give Atlas any of my time.  Overall, if you can pick this up for $10 or less and sell it back for $5 or more, I'd say it's barely worth it."

44198,2,"I must agree with most of the other user reviews criticizing High Heat 2004.
Incredibly, THERE IS NO MOUSE SUPPORT for this supposed PC Game!
Whoever made the decision to sell out High Heat PC users this way should be fired immediately!
Not only is there no mouse support but the menu interface is a complete nightmare!  It's literaly an ordeal just trying to set up and start a game!
I will never understand why a company will take a very good PC  product and just tear it down for game consoles!  3DO has sold PC users out for game consoles!
Just like NBA Live 2003, High Heat 2004 has gone over to the dark side!  It's no wonder that there is no demo. Five minutes with this intolerable interface would convince any PC User not to bother.
  The graphics are better and the game is still fun to play but the terrible interface and many missing features ruin it.
The sound and color commentary have improved little, if at all.
I think it's time to send a message to companies like EAsports and 3D0 who sell out PC Users for consoles!

Works just fine only issue is the ""Z"" and ""L/R"" buttons are reversed to the Gamecube layout i.e. the ""Z"" is below the ""L/R"". Since I wanted to use this mostly for Smash it's not a huge deal since you can map inputs but it's personally extremely irritating. Curious to know why couldn't the old layout be used in this controller?"
349324,2,"If you've played Borderlands or Borderlands 2, there isn't much that's going to change for you.  For better or worse.

In fact, you could be mistaken thinking you ARE playing Borderlands 2, as Borderlands TPS uses the same graphical engine as Borderlands 2.  However, there isn't as much of a change of scenery (Your opinion of this will vary, as Borderlands was just a big desert for the most part, and TPS is just the moon save for one section in a moon base).

Borderlands TPS still drops loot.  Your ""random is random"" luck will vary.  No real change in drop rates from Borderlands 2.  You will still need to do an inordinate amount of grinding through sections and bosses in order to get legendaries.  If there's a single most disappointing feature of the game, that would be in the running.

There is an crazy amount of clipping as well, through rocks, walls, etc. that should be solid.  The series is showing its age on the PS3.

Low gravity is definitely a hook, and it adds a dimension to combat, but if you're thinking Halo tight, you're thinking wrong.  Just as important, you can literally get yourself stuck on an early mission (if you fall to the floor below, you will have absolutely no way to get back up and it's a main story mission, so the only remedy at this stage would be to begin an entire new character).

The sound and music are all still very good, which has been the norm for this series throughout.  However, in terms of voice over, I hope you like Australian accents because that's a ton of the game. (Apparently Elpis was colonized by them, who know the outback was to the moon?)

As far as the story, it's not even close to as good as Borderlands 2, but more than what Borderlands 1 did, if only in that it's pretty much impossible to not have a better story than the first one did.  They had a great opportunity to show Jack off and it just fell flat for me.  The banter between the Vault Hunters can be pretty entertaining though.

The big ""hook"" of the new Vault Hunters is Claptrap, and while Borderlands 2's guys were enhancements of Borderlands 1's crew, each one seems different enough that it's worth going through the game with each, as long as you can tolerate all the things I listed above, and what I'm listing now:

- Remember having to start Borderlands 2 over again and having to go through the same long, boring sequence?  It's just as mind-numbing in Borderlands:  TPS.  If you're a first time player to the series, you'll appreciate the nuances.  If you're someone like me who has put in 300+ hours in both games, it just drags on, and on, and on
- The first raid boss is...no different than the final boss.  In fact, it IS the final boss, albeit trumped up.  This smacks of a mail in, as every raid boss in Borderlands 2 was different.
- The grinder has been added, yes you CAN get legendaries from it (it's one of the achivements of the game), but that only means you're crossing your fingers that the grinder god will give you a legendary instead of farming and getting one to drop.
- There can be SO MUCH going on at once (especially with Claptrap) that it obscures the screen to a point you have no idea what's hitting you or even where they are.  That of course is a sentence to put you into FFYL and a respawn.
- Side quests.  Oh, the humanity.  It's pretty much like this:
*I need you go to here
*Oops, somethings broke, go fix it
*Ok, now you're in but I need you to attach X # of objects
*Finally, everything is complete.  Come on back
*Walk/Moon Jump about 5-7 minutes to get back where they are
*Minimal reward
Now, about the ONLY thing they are mostly good far are getting a couple unique items and EXP, which you'll definitely need as the game has many hard stops (meaning, you'll need to be 2-3 levels above the section/boss you are fighting to get past it).  But nothing's changed from Borderlands 1 or 2 in this department and it's REALLY getting old Gearbox.

In short, while there is a season pass to the game like Borderlands 1 and 2, which means GBX is committed to producing new content, your enjoyment of Borderlands:  TPS is directly tied to your experience as a Borderlands player.

If you've never played the series before, go and pick up Borderlands 2 GOTY edition.  For $15-20 bucks, you'll getting a much better game, experience, story, and depth.  I wouldn't want you to form an opinion on just the basis of this game while GBX is working on Borderlands 3 for next-gen.

If you have played Borderlands 1 and 2, and like 2 especially, then this will be more of the same goodness for you and you should definitely buy it.  Whether or not you should do that at the $60 price point is largely your preference.

UPDATE #1:  10/17/2014

I am removing another star from this game.

In starting another new character, I am finding I got VERY lucky on my first playthrough.

There are no less then THREE main missions at the moment that have game breaking bugs (i.e., if you get stuck on that mission, you have 2 possible options, start a brand new character or join someone in a game that completes the mission while you're with them).  These two things do NOT always fix the issue.  There are threads upon threads in the Gearbox Forums talking about these and others (again, there are plenty of side missions that are bugged as well).

It's unacceptable for Gearbox to release a game in which you cannot progress through the main story without missions breaking.

If Gearbox patches all of these main mission bugs out, I will think about restoring a 3rd star to my rating.

Just FYI...in over 300 hours of playing Borderlands 2 starting over 12 different characters, not ONCE did a main mission bug out on me.  That's because Gearbox developed the game completely on their own. This was outsourced to 2K Austraila to develop."
343802,2,this game is horrible one of the worst games I've ever played can't even get passed the first level I got bored with it after playing it for an hour trying to figure out how to get out of the first level that's when the game lost my interest. if you have not played this game then I recommend you don't
260315,2,"Well, I just had to find out for myself... BestBuy had the special edition on sale for $49.99 so I took the chance, ""how bad can it be?"" well I'm early in the game, offline made it to the lickers... died 3 times and quit playing. I might give it another go, then try online which might make it more fun, but i hate online. If this was Move control compatible like I wanted it would at least be a cool light gun type/Move game, but no matter how I adjust the aiming it sucks... I might put back on the default auto aim and lock on, but don't know if that will improve the flailing controls. The graphics aren't bad, there's pop-in with minor details but it all feels buttery, when you kill things it just feels like mush... there's no feeling of physical illusion, it's all kind of shiny, buttery, goo. I haven't tried yet, but If I can still unlock the special weapons I might play it some more... if you can level up offline buying more powerful weapons might make it easier and hence more fun.

I'd rather Crapcom had made a newer Outbreak game wish characters you can give a F' about over these faceless goons."
257787,2,"Killing games purge and I am well purged after this game.  Enjoyed it but I don't play it everyday and I rarely play games to completion. Great graphics which for me is a huge plus and the game play is ok.  Nothing more and nothing less.  Pretty deep analysis isn't it?  Well, you asked after all so live with it.  LOL"
266977,2,"If you read this review, I hope you at least take it into consideration,  I was extremely excited for this prior to release.  The game sounded great and it seemed like it was going to be just what the vita needed.  What you get is average graphics, alot of so-so missions that are just standard run of the mill and VERY repetitive.  The gun's just don't feel right and you really don't get as much of a choice as you would think rolling through missions, sure you could make you own way through the levels, but if you don't go about it the way the game WANTS you to, you are in for some trouble.  However, the netcode on this is very good, it's a bit more fun playing with a friend.  Someone you know, not a random, still though, i would avoid this game."
272240,2,"I am a big Kalypso game fan, especially Tropico games, so I was super excited for this game. I was thinking a gangster style tropico. This it is not. It is VERY slow paced, tedious and has a terrible interface. Half the time I didn't know what needed to be done, how to do it or why I'm doing it. The other half couldn't care less. It stays slow the whole time. The combat is a real chore most of the time. If your a tropico fan this is not the same level of game. If interested you might want to rent it or wait for it to hit the bargin bin."
208389,2,"As everyone should know by now, ""The Force Unleashed II"" is a sequel, and therefore the story picks up where it left off. Combining three of the most powerful game creation software systems into a single game - Digital Molecular Matter, the Havok physics engine, and Euphoria - this game somehow manages to both work beautifully and suck terribly.

1. STORY: The story is supposed to ""stand on its own"", but instead it feels somewhat like the middle season of a soap opera with no ability to see the beginning or ending. The concept as it stands now comes dangerously close to breaking the ""cloning"" lore created in the early nineties by Timothy Zahn - that Jedi can be cloned, but it does not work very well - and so one is left hoping that this ""clone"" is merely a mind-wiped Starkiller. The story itself is poor, underdeveloped, and a haphazard mess of cliches and awesome action sequences. Instead of ""stand[ing] on its own"", it barely stands with the first game, the story of which was infinitely better, though still worse than most games of today. Also, the ending Light/Dark choice is made by pressing either the R1 or L1 shoulder buttons. It feels like a complete cop-out. (1/5)

2. COMBAT: Much like the first game, this title is filled to the brim with it. While it was somewhat easy to handle in TFU, in this title it gets annoying very quickly. From point A, the intro, to point B, the ending, there is nothing but combat. For some, this may not be such a bad thing, but when you're surrounded by some of the most beautiful scenery ever seen in a game, the lack of opportunities to take a breather goes from annoying to nightmarish. However, unlike TFU, Force powers feel considerably more powerful and useful: Force Repulse in the first game felt like a joke, while here it actually has a decent use in either one-hit-killing enemies or at least knocking them over. Lightsaber combos feel much more fluid, as well. The targeting mechanic, however, feels clumsier than in TFU: rather than using a standard reticule, an outline appears on the target, which is harder to see and harder to direct. Also, if there are enemies about and you want to toss some containers at them for a quick kill or stun - too bad, the game fights with you and likes to target the enemy instead. (2/5)

3. CAMERA: The camera is neither improved nor worsened, though occasionally it got hung up on walls in tight spaces. It never gets hung up on enemies, which is nice, and has less of a tendency to ""pop"" from place to place than it did in TFU. (4/5)

4. GRAPHICS: Quite honestly one of the most beautifully-rendered, highly-detailed games on the market to date, and it benefits wonderfully from the PlayStation 3's Blu-ray capabilities. From sheets of rain pouring down Kaminoan windows to the shine on Vader and the Stormtroopers' armor to the atmosphere of Dagobah, the game never fails to disappoint. For this alone it is worth a day's rent. The three engines only make the graphics stand out even more wonderfully, and honestly, the graphics tend to make an otherwise highly linear and cramped game feel bigger and far more open. The vistas on Cato Neimodia alone are enough to make your jaw drop a little at times. The uncanny valley feeling of the first game has been toned down; the contrast between the in-game graphics and the pre-rendered cutscenes is virtually nonexistent. (5/5)

5. LENGTH: As has been said by many other reviewers, the game is horribly short. Tearing through the single-player campaign, without taking detours for collectibles or what little exploration there is, takes about five to six hours on Easy. TFU was only about eight to ten hours with a moderate replay value; while TFU2 has replay value, it is a little bit lower than for the first game, if only because many of the PS3's trophies will be received within the first playthrough. Some of the trophies provide an entertaining experience, however, considering that one of them requires you to cause a certain number of Stormtroopers to jump to their deaths. The ""challenges"" available from the main menu also add entertainment value, with the ability to log in to the PlayStation Network and rank on the leaderboards. (3/5)

6. DIALOGUE: both improved over and worse than the first game. Starkiller is about as annoying as Anakin, especially during the final level, though what he says when tricking Stormtroopers into doing his bidding is quite amusing. As always, Rahm Kota is entertaining and snarky, though his constant demands to do what he's telling you to do can get extremely obnoxious after the first two or three times. ""Stop Helping Me"" comes into effect fairly often - you are never given the chance to really figure out anything by yourself. Juno Eclipse was virtually nonexistent throughout the game, so her dialogue was, in that way, far improved. Boba Fett's voice actor also does a great job, but Yoda just sounds like bad fanfiction. The return of a certain Ensemble Darkhorse from TFU was like a breath of fresh air. Overall, the whole thing is really hit-or-miss - even Vader gets obnoxious really quickly. (3/5)

7. PLAYIBILITY: The controls feel much smoother and tighter than in the first game. For the PS3, the controls are wonderfully intuitive, though the lack of Sixaxis support make the falling sequences a little tougher for some. Starkiller rarely goes hopping off ledges or straight into the path of death, as he did in the first game. The only real complaint, as before, are the controls used for the Force Grip - it is more difficult to toss things around now, though easier to remember which stick does what. (5/5)

OVERALL: Definitely a renter, this game is not worth its full price. It is worth getting for its status as, honestly, a work of art, though it suffers from length, dialogue, and continued Force Grip issues. May the Force be with you. (23/35)"
165679,2,"I loved the first My Sims game for the Gamecube.  I found this one to be not as much fun.  Fishing and prospecting are a little different because of the Wii controllers.  I didn't like the constant need to go back and forth between the person I had to help and my friend to get the power to do the project.  I felt it just dragged in that sense.  With the first My Sims, I had a hard time putting away the game, with this one, I played twice and haven't bothered to pick it up again."
147511,2,"Lost Odyssey has great visuals, especially in the many (and I mean many) movie sequences. In the end however the gameplay is repetitive and you are dragged by the nose the entire story line.  The storyline is one big clich around the central theme of immortal characters, the other themes are the same from every Final Fantasy game from which it borrows the feel and turn based combat style.

Due to the very high quantity of videos it feels like something you are watching rather than playing, and occasionally the game allows you to play through a couple of combats to give you an illusion of interaction. The voice acting (in English at least) is absurdly bad and cheesy, soap opera style, the script of the story doesn't help and the actors must have felt somewhat helpless with the lines they were given (specially the interactions involving the protagonist, who is trying to be far more serious than the rest of the project).  The only truly artistic part can be seen in the poems that appear in the form of dreams, although completely devoid of any gaming element they are (some of them) truly well made.

Without spoilers one can only wonder what they were expecting placing characters like the grandchildren in the game. I honestly felt silly through major portions of the story for playing this. The lack of control over saving also makes this a difficult game for the busier player since you cannot be assured that you can play ""just another 10 minutes and save"".  You save when they let you save, you play when the movie is done, and you fight at every six steps. The combat system is the FF turn based we all know but with a timing mechanism of two rings (to create SOME sort of interaction by the player) that while it seems like a good idea it gets boring as hell.

As a final note the steady progression of the opponents makes no sense, at some point you are battling regular soldiers who are still a match to your characters despite the fact that you are 20-30 levels higher since the last time you faced them.

In the end I felt the Lost Odyssey is a childish game they purred a lot of resources in. It isn't worth the time though."
490060,2,"Not a very fun game to play, random crashes, long load times and quirky game play, I'm hardly into this game and I'm bored with it. Does not even compare to Doom.

I say avoid. A waste of $20 for me."
244704,2,"Graphics were good; however, it was bit drawn in at certain points. The story line was bland at best. They gave you miniguns at points where you may only have to kill an enemy or two, but did not give you enough ammo when you were ambushed by a hoard of enemies. The boss fights were just annoying most of the time. With all that being said, there was a few good points about the abilities such as persuade and other abilities that help you take out your enemies. The game play is choppy and not as smooth as other shooters I have played. I could not recommend this game to anyone as the abilities in the game do not make up for its downfalls."
148555,2,"I had such high hopes for this game, particularly given the glowing reviews.  Yet this game offered absolutely nothing new.

The campaign play was incredibly dull and linear, and most players could complete it in a day of gaming.  Not even a long day at that.  The storyline is somewhat lame, even for a video game. They attempted to spice things up by having more vehicular scenarios, but these really were not that exciting either.

Except for the ability to pick up an opponent off the ground and use him as a shield, there is no neat new functions or behaviors.  There are a couple of new weapons, but again nothing exciting (a new pistol, a new type of grenade, and a flamethrower).

On-line play was incredibly disappointing.  The only plus is that there are more types of scenarios than there used to be, but that again is the ONLY positive.  The maps are tiny, not allowing for much room to maneuver.  Joining a game can take forever.  I was sometimes sitting there for five minutes while whatever algorithms Epic came up with tried to find a party and then a set of matching opponents.  Once I (eventually) got in, the games were incredibly sensitive to any player that had a weak connection, to the point is screwed up gameplay for everyone else.

Epic could have saved everyone time, money, and dashed hopes by simply releasing a map-pack for the first game for a sixth of the price of GOW 2, and it would have provided the same amount of enjoyment."
281706,2,"I love C&C especially Red Alert 2, but the problem is how buggy all most of the games are. Not only do you have to download them individually, you have to do a lot of research on how to make it run on your platform for each game since they are all outdated codes. I managed to run most, but when you exit the game, it crashes my Win 7! $6 price tag is unbeatable, but keep in mind that you have to tinker with it before using. Origin blows!"
488929,2,It ok
308763,2,"The campaign story was weak and the action took a while to become interesting. I never felt a connection with the characters. Playing as a dog was novel, I guess.

216559,2,"My 10 year old daughter says this game is boring and lame. She only played the game once, and hasn't even looked at it since. Maybe it was too hard for her."
99830,2,"STORY-

Dawn of Mana (henceforth referred to as DoM by me) is an action-RPG platformer hybrid set in the isle of Illusia. A boy named Keldric and his friend Ritzia live peaceful lives in harmony with nature...at least until the tiresomely predictable antagonist shows up and manages to ruin everything in less time than it takes you to say `plot device'. Keldy and his fairy friend, Faye, must rescue Ritzia and save the world from evil. Seriously. That's about as far in depth as I can describe it, because that's mostly all there is to it. Save the girl, defeat the darkness and restore the universe. It's not the worst story I've ever seen, and the presentation is excellent, but I really wish RPGs would stop with these sorts of narratives. You would've thought that they could have come up with something a little more original than `brash teenage boy on a quest to stop evil and save the gentle hearted damsel in distress', but no. Obviously not.

BATTLE SYSTEM-

Square apparently realized that the Kingdom Hearts style of combat was an excellent choice for RPG-adventure-platforming games and it shows in DoM. Keldy can jump around and swing his sword in a simple combo attack, much like Sora's Keyblade. What sets DoM apart from KH, however, is the fact that Keldy can whip out a handy vine to grab objects and fling them around, thus damaging enemies and panicking them. In theory, it sounds like a good system to work with, but there are highly noticeable flaws with it. Number one is the abysmal lock-on system. While it honestly doesn't sound like a very difficult thing to get right in a game, Square has somehow managed to botch the job completely. It frequently locks on to targets in the background and ignores the foreground, even when the opposing force is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. You can cycle through targets, but there are often so many objects on the screen at one time (rocks, crates, etc.) that by the time you've found the enemy you wanted, it'll have already hacked off your limbs.

Number two is the physics. DoM implements the Havok Engine, which also happens to have been used in Half-Life 2. However, the physics engine seemed more bothersome than innovative for me, especially during combat. If you get hit by an enemy Keldy will be sent flying backwards as though he's in outer space. The only thing you can do when this happens is watch him go up in an arc and then land face down, refusing to move, while the adversary gnaws on his gonads. Frequently, you will have to panic enemies by throwing things at them, but this gimmick quickly becomes repetitive in of itself. What could have been an interesting combat system was broken down to the bare basics of picking up, throwing, and then bashing the enemy with the same combo you'll use throughout the entire game. Fun? Maybe for a little while. Long term? Absolutely not.

GAMEPLAY-

I feel as if any more comparison to Kingdom Hearts will be redundant, but something has to be said for the similarities between the two. Considering that KH is an extremely lucrative franchise, it doesn't surprise me that Square wants to replicate as much of the successful formula as much as it possibly can. Despite their valiant efforts, however, a lot of what made Kingdom Hearts entertaining hasn't been reproduced very well here. DoM uses a chapter-based system to advance the plot meaning the game sets you loose in an expansive environment to explore the level(s) and eventually defeat a boss, thus ending the section and moving on with the story. Keldy can gain experience by panicking enemies with thrown objects and then, once the enemy is defeated, picking up medals that will gradually increase his stats. The ONLY WAY to get these items is to panic the enemies. You're forced to continue picking up, rolling, throwing or breaking objects simply so that you can advance in the game. Using a sophisticated physics engine is one thing, but blatantly pushing it at the consumer is another. The vine ability would have been better utilized as an `extra' - something useful for acquiring greater amounts of medals or simply stunning the enemy. The fact that it feels like such a necessity didn't sit well with me at all.

Even worse than that, however, is the fact that Keldy's level resets to 1 every time you begin a new Chapter. This means that you'll go through the process of gaining and then losing stats eight agonizing times during the course of the game. What do people want to get out of RPGs? Well, a feeling of accomplishment, of course. By nullifying the stat bonuses at the conclusion of each Chapter, DoM effectively kills any feeling of productivity and progress. I felt like I was starting at the beginning of the game each time by health was reduced and my attacks became drastically weaker once more.

All that said and done, the environments are all unique in their own ways and each has a distinct `feel' to it. However, a lot of the time, I felt simply lost and without a clue where to go. There's a small radar in the top right hand corner of the screen, but it's about as useful as an umbrella during a hurricane. It provides your destination, but it fails to account for whatever obstacles may be in your way while trying to get there. Frequently, I felt as though I was being forced to blaze my own trail: something I don't particularly enjoy in a video game such as this (it was fine in Shadow of the Colossus). DoM is tight-lipped with hints and mission objectives, which is a problem considering how large some of the levels are. My overall feelings were those of confusion and frustration. It's far too easy to get lost, and when you do, there isn't really a way to find out where you are or how to get where you're going to.

But I'm not quite done yet. Since DoM is a platformer, I would've expected that the controls be at least decent. Unfortunately, much like every other aspect of the gameplay, they failed to impress and frequently irritated. Keldy's movements often seem to lack fluidity; he runs as though he's on the moon and his jumping somehow manages to be even worse. Couple this with the game's ragdoll physics and you can bet that you'll be falling off most of the platforms you're supposed to be jumping on. The camera is just as obtuse as everything else. It's difficult to control and tough to position behind Keldy, making for an all-around mediocre experience.

VISUALS, CHARACTERS and AUDIO-

If there's any praise I can squeeze out for DoM, it's most likely for the appearance of the game itself. Although the core gameplay mechanics are a mess, the graphics themselves are beautiful and detailed. The animation during cutscenes is usually quite good: it's full of eye-candy. I'm a sucker for video games with sharp-looking design, but we all know that it can't carry the entire thing. There aren't really all that many characters, and the ones you do meet are never very well characterized. Keldy doesn't differ in the slightest from the many other teenage RPG heroes, or if he does, the distinction was too subtle for me to notice. To be fair, the voice-acting for Keldy and co. is above average and generally believable (if not a bit hokey at times). One other area in which DoM excels was the sound. The musical score is fantastic, and there were several tracks that I actually enjoyed listening to. In these respects only, DoM is one of the better RPGs I've seen in the last year or so.

OVERALL-

I genuinely wanted to enjoy Dawn of Mana, but there were noticeable blemishes on the gameplay that marred the experience for me. It's a bit of a love-hate relationship: I couldn't help but be drawn in by the art and music, but was ultimately deterred by the horrendously broken controls and unsatisfying level-reset system. It didn't help that the story was only average and the characters were the same archetypes you see in every RPG these days. I'm glad I rented it first, and anyone else thinking of buying should probably do the same if they don't want to be disappointed."
345215,2,"I thought this would be a great deal, but I've pretty much gone back to using my generic headset rather than my Turtle Beach because getting the sound just right was incredibly difficult, particularly with any regularity.  I couldn't use all three options (bass, chat, game) on the headset . . . only game worked.  In order to hear the other people in my party, I had to turn down the volume in the game, which meant that I couldn't here certain things going on in the background.  You would think that Microsoft would have worked out a better system for integrating people's headsets before launch.  You CAN get this to work, but it can be a pain in the butt and even if you get it working, you're probably not going to get the sound quality that you were expecting (or that you're used to from using your headset with your old 360)."
205060,2,"I have played almost every Move game and Kinect game and wanted to break down the best and the worst. This game was first a demo  which I replayed and finished 4 times while really looking forward to my pre-order. The Wii version was one of my favorite Wii games of all time, so I was sure I was going to give this a 5 star rating (I already rated the Wii version with 5 stars). The problems begin with the little side quests. In the Wii version, you'd play knock off games of the Atari 2600. The games had a real retro flare, and were FUN. In the PS3 version, you drive around on a motorcycle which can be infuriating at times, especially when you drive into a tree (light pole). If you drive into a tree with the Move controller, you'd have to either use the Sixaxis controller to back up or just get off the bike. The Move controller didn't allow you to back up if you ran into a tree for some reason, although allowed you to back up otherwise by hitting the trigger button. So, you'd end up running for a while, and then you'd call for your bike again. The side quests all related to some kind of tropical environment. Collecting coconuts was fun with the Wii version, but this side quest on the PS3 was just weird. Mowing the grass was weird because I couldn't figure out the controls (although in the end, I always earned a lot of money :)). Some of the side quests were fighting related, but required you didn't get hit once. If you do, the challenge ends, and you can restart or just leave.
The bosses were fun. I especially liked Electroman, and took me a while to figure out how to beat him. I let my friend borrow this when PSN was down and he said he didn't like it at all. The weird thing also is that this game was 10 dollars cheaper as a pre-release than it is now. The trade-in value is also low, so take that into consideration. Peace"
104530,2,"I bought this game back in 2011 at a local gamestop because my cousin use to tell me how great the series was plus gamestop was offering it used for like $10 bucks so I said what the hell I will give it a try. The graphics I noticed straight away as being good especially if you press the (Square) button during the movie scenes to get a different angle. The controls i did find difficult and the game did have the same things reoccurring in every level. Sneaking around the town finding people, climbing buildings and then establishing a map of the town. Really I wanted this game to be good and tried to like it, but it just wasn't my type of game got old quick, controls gave me issues, got pissed I couldn't skip dialogue during some of the longer movie scenes. Good things about this game were the grpahics and the combo moves you could use on your enimies."
277518,2,"For those able to be comfortable holding this thing, i'm sure this is a great mouse in terms of functionality, and I found the action to be pretty good as well. I couldn't really grip this mouse without hitting a button inadvertently, and there is a very sharp edge on the right side of the side buttons, at the base of your thumb. Surprisingly sharp.

This was an uncomfortable mouse for me to hold, so I returned it. I do miss having so many buttons available while playing WoW, however."
121016,2,"For a short while the mouse was beautiful, amazing. I take care of my equipment and this mouse was no exception. However, after a month or so my cursor would stop moving, or it became jagged. I kept having to reset the mouse for the software to work correctly. The software and driver was up to date, but it continued doing it. I found many others had this error, Razer offered no fixes and still doesn't."
122062,2,"After reading all of these glowing reviews (and watching some on YouTube,) I decided that this must be a fabulous piece of gaming equipment and ordered one; but having been warned by one reviewer--which is very vital--that the length of time between pulling the trigger and the time it hits the button on the remote seems to be FOREVER.

The same review went on to say that he had to jam a piece of plastic into the gun to make it so that the trigger while in ""resting position"" wasn't as far away since the folks at Nyko couldn't figure out how to measure things properly.

So in short, my experience went as follows: got the gun and put the remote in place. Played around with it, getting the feel and trying to see exactly how the trigger pulls, the weight, etc. Instantly noticed that for my only-slightly-bigger-than-the-average-woman's-sized-hands (I'm a 27yr old guy, for reference) already felt uncomfortable around the somewhat-too-wide, and blocky feeling handgrip. Started playing House of the Dead Returns--the intended purpose of actually getting a gun accessory (besides the zapper)--and noticed immediately the delay with using a spring-loaded trigger to press a rather small 'B' button on the front of the remote.

It just plain takes too long with too much effort to squeeze-release-squeeze-release the trigger in order to pull-off rapid fire shots! When using the remote by itself, I could squeeze-off 4-6 shots in the time it takes to do 2 with the Perfect Shot.

...and modding the remote with the plastic do-hickey? More complicated than it sounds. That'll be a personal mission for another day.

I can't complain enough about this gun. Maybe it DOES feel more like a ""REAL pistol"", but to me, that's quite a sacrifice when trying to play a VIDEOGAME with it--it's just not the same mechanics/functionality in my mind (and in my trigger finger, for that matter).

I found a third-party [or really FIFTH-party] pistol-shaped gun accessory, that's all over the internet, for next to nothing on an auction site in my desperate search for a pistol accessory that actually works, and that works beautifully. It's much smaller overall and has a noticably shorter trigger response time--that is, once I could figure out the exact angle to get the remote to fit... but nothing is ""Perfect"" after all, right?

UPDAAAAAATE: There is now an official set of the cheap plastic, knock-off being sold on Amazon. And since a handful of the comments have asked exactly 'WHUT' it was that I had been referring to, I can now link to it here. Hooray!

189865,2,"I am going to be as objective as I can and I am not jumping on any bandwagon here. I am a big Star Trek fan and I love Star Trek games. While there have been more stinkers than winners and I still hold out hope that SECRET OF VULCAN FURY will one day be brought back, I look forward to each release with excitement. I had very high hopes for Star Trek Online but after some play in the beta and now the release, I have since cancelled my membership and will no longer play this poorly designed game.

While I could overlook the weak graphics, the game play made me frustrated. The most annoying  thing was completing a hard mission and then never getting credit for it. When searching the forums, I find out that you had to be at a certain level to get credit for completion. Nowhere in the game is it said this is needed nor are you prevented for doing a mission you will never get credit for. To me, this is a showstopper. And when I finally get to the level that the forums say I need to be on to complete it, I still don't get the credit and by the 4th time on a mission, I never want to see it again. I had to be harsh but this takes the fun out of the game.

The game itself isn't half bad but it could be more ambitious. The space combat is excellent and the ground combat isn't too bad. However, there is hardly a moment of awe exploring something or even handling a diplomatic situation. I think I handled one situation on a planet but never again. Star Trek was WAY more than just battles. If they incorporated what made the old games 25th Anniversary and Judgment Rites so much fun, then this game would have been a winner.

Being that this is an online game and it can grow, I perhaps can return to the game if they fix the bugs or add more ""exploring"" or ""diplomatic"" missions. Since I purchased it online, I cannot sell a used copy. For now, I will say it was the biggest waste of money I've ever spend in gaming."
116173,2,"Good things about this game:
1) Absolutely stunning graphics, the best I've seen.
2) Beautiful level design. An insane amount of effort must have been put into making the areas so super detailed. One can't shake the impression that they're in a post-apocalpytic world.
3) Lots of random encounters and other neat crap can be found while just wandering about the wasteland. There doesn't seem to be any requirement to play the tedious quests. It is a real blast to wander about the wastelands.

Bad things about this game:
1) Tedious, repetitive, and uninteresting Oblivion-style ""go fetch"" quests.
2) Inside of buildings baddies will not respawn after you kill them. Monsters respawn only in the outside Wastelands.
3) The maximum character level is 20. If you try to play this game thinking that you'll level up indefinitely like you do in Oblivion, you will be in for a rude surprise - the perks and skills you select when you level up need to be done with the their usefulness after you reach the limit in mind. Also, level 20 is only enough to get one skill to 100 (or two skills if you ignore all the rest), so don't expect to ever have a powerful character. There is a console command that is supposed to allow the player to advance past this maximum (setgs iMaxCharacterLevel ###), but my the game crashes no matter what when trying to go past level 20, even with this ""cheat"" enabled. I am presuming that this stupid maximum level is here to accomodate some future expansion pack that will raise this limit higher. Grrr.
4) Copy protection did not allow me to install the game. I instead downloaded a pirated cracked copy (thanks Reloaded!) and installed that. Later, when the first patch came out, I copied my Falloutlaunder.exe from my DVD so I could patch the game; as long as I have the disc in the drive the game plays without any lip from the SecuROM copy protection.
5) The game locks up quite a bit. In fact, playing this game requires that you be okay with doing a hard reset of your machine every so often because of the lock ups. Be aware that the first patch (1.0.0.15) caused my game to become nearly unplayable due to the increased rate of lockups (which this patch was supposed to *reduce*), and I don't recommend installing this particular patch.
6) 50% of the time, quicksaves get eaten after exiting the game and returning. Do not rely on them if you enjoy not having to do the same stuff over and over again because your savegame got lost. Autosaves and manual saves seem to work fine.
7) Imbalanced role playing: doing quests the ""evil"" way often results in a lesser reward than if you completed them using the ""good"" way. Grrr.
8) Numerous types of bugs in quests, some of which render them uncompletable. Numerous typos in dialog. Obvious places where flags should have been set to trigger an event or some dialog, but don't get set for some reason and so nothing special happens as a result of your actions.
9) Game does not allow you to harm children (eating Raider corpses is okay though).
10) I got to a point in my game where, regardless of what I did, the game would lock up after one to five minutes. I started a new game, and didn't have this problem, but my old game was still broken. I guess at this point I'm waiting for the next patch level to come out before giving it another try.

My recommendation:
Do not buy this game right now. Wait until the end of its life cycle (a couple years) when it has been patched thoroughly and all the ""expansions"" (which, it seems in this case, are really just missing parts of the original game) have been released. Then I think you should *consider* buying it."
251776,2,"I agree with apparently half the reviews.

The pros are pretty much limited to the cool LED colors, and being batman related.

The cons are horrid analog sticks, nearly defunkt down on the D pad, and to anyone who's gamed with dualshocks for a few years it will feel completely alien, even to me and I also play xbox. o_O

It works for games like RPGs, where no precision is needed. But if you need precision, I.E. aiming in a first person shooter, don't bother with this controller.

Another strange feature is that the USB cable it comes with is somehow incompatible with a standard Dualshock. So unless you intend to use this controller, the USB cord is junk.

A final oddity.. Even though it's ps3-specific, it can't link to the ps3, requiring the use of your already limited USB ports for the IR receiver."
245654,2,Halo isn't the same anymore. Didn't care much for the story the enemies felt they were an after thought and the Multiplayer was lacking

215747,2,"My son and I have been playing video games together since he was an infant and used to sit on my lap behind the steering wheel to beep the horn or push various buttons while I raced. We had a lot of fun playing Midnight Club and Need for Speed. Honest to God, once when he was about 3 and we were racing, he said, ""Mom, do you have a pair of scissors?"" I said, ""Huh?!"" Then he chortled and said, ""Because I'm going to cut you off!"" and he did!!!

So, when I purchased this, my hope was that we could again enjoy playing ""Need for Speed"" together, as in one as the cop, one as the criminal, race via split screen. Nope. This doesn't support split screen or co-op play.

It doesn't seem to connect via a normal Xbox Live account either, but requires a specific/separate EA Games account (which, whenever you start the game you're prompted for and have to skip if you don't).

Beyond that, as just a one player racing game, it's still pretty fun. The courses and objectives are challenging and even in just the first sector which we've unlocked, there are about 10 different courses, each with a subsection of various missions.

It works extremely well with a force feedback steering wheel (surprising that all racing games don't?).

As a racing game by itself, it's really good, but I sincerely miss having the split-screen option since I still love playing video games along side my son and don't intend to buy another Xbox and Xbox live account to sit in another room just to play together (defeats the purpose, no?)."
308955,2,IGN gave the game a 8.8 but I don't know about that... Im about tired of Call of Duty franchise doing the same stuff every year nothing new or exciting. Last Call of Duty game I didn't even touch the campaign. I believe Call of Duty reached its pinnacle at MW3 after that the games just go drastically downhill. If you like Call of Duty switch to BF4 its beautifully constructed and a blast to play unlike this game. I returned mine.
319801,2,"First things first, this is an extremely shallow game. It's a beat 'em up callback to the classic arcade and 16-bit TMNT games, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on Wii is lacking the smooth animations, inspired levels, interesting boss fights, great music, and pretty much everything else that made these past games so great. It's a disappointing affair full of technical problems.

The game controls well enough, I suppose. You're able to switch between any of the four Turtles on the fly, which is a welcome enough addition. All of the Turtles remain on screen throughout the whole game, but the AI scripting for your allies is downright bad. Most will stand in one place, slashing away with one attack. Every now and again they'll do something useful, but by and large, the AI here is just plain bad. The same goes for the mindless enemies in the game. All in all, you'll beat up around 4 or 5 different enemy types, none of which make you change up your strategy, and you're left with a game that doesn't feel nearly as diverse or satisfying as it probably should.

The visuals range from OK to just plain awful. While some levels and backgrounds are interestingly enough designed from an aesthetic standpoint, some are too dark to really see what's going on, or worse, just re-use art over and over again. Sometimes these levels will offer enough variety for you to move into or out of the screen through segues like alleyways and the like, but there's nothing compelling about any of these levels, or the game in general. Beat dudes up, go right, fight a boss every 4th level. That's all there is to it, and nothing here is memorable, in the least.

Throughout the levels, you can find collectibles like mutagen canisters, or health pickups like pizza or sushi, but this hardly makes up for the bare-bones design of the game. The game's biggest detriment is that it's just so repetitive. I can't stress this enough. Nothing ever really changes, despite having the option to apply combat upgrades for the Turtles. The hit detection works OK, but all of your attacks lack any sense of weight. Attacks feel no different from hitting the air to hitting an enemy. It's clear that a lot of thought wasn't put into this game, and as a result, we're left with something wholly uninspired, even managing to brim on terrible, at times.

The game's most absolutely worst aspect lies within its sound design. I won't nit-pick about certain voices being left out that are present in the titular cartoon series, but the sound mixing here is the absolute worst I've heard in any game. Ever. Some characters sound OK, while others sound like their lines were recorded in a bathroom stall. To compensate, the gain was turned up on these audio levels, and we're left with loud, distorted, often jarring voice work. It's absolutely baffling how problems like this got through.

If you just want to play through a mindless beat 'em up, then by all means, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles may be for you. If you're looking for something with a deep combat system, high production values, or any lasting appeal, then look elsewhere. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a bland, wholly uninspired game. From the legitimately awful sound mixing to the repetitious nature of the gameplay, as well as the levels, there's really nothing here worth paying for. If you want to play a sincerely good Turtles beat 'em up, play Turtles in Time, Hyperstone Heist, the '89 Arcade Game, or The Manhattan Project. There are much better alternatives out there, and this is easily one of the lesser games the franchise has ever seen. Don't spend your money on this."
473110,2,Wanted a soccer game for the psp as soccer is my favorite sport but was disapointed in this game. The reason I found it so disapointing is proberly because the soccer game I had been playing for a while was the 2010 version on the XBOX and the comparison was light and day. I have heard that the 2010 version on psp is better than 09 so I will be looking to that for my psp soccer fix.
166858,2,"If there was ever a video game that fully demonstrates how super-duper eye candy by itself does NOT make a 5-star game, well, let me introduce you to Prince of Persia...THE standard!  And while we're at it, just WHO was the target audience for this dreadful game???  Within 10 minutes of starting the game, my 6-yr old ran out of the room screaming and crying when Ahriman (the god of Darkness) was released...10 minutes later I ran out of the room screaming and crying because this game has the WORST storyline of any PS3 game (really, now...Light seeds & light gardens to control the god of Darkness?  Sounds like someone was on a hallucinogenic trip to come up with THAT), bore-me-to-tears repetitive gameplay and absolutely NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES for any of your actions - Your character simply can not die...Even if he slit his own throat from being forced to respond to the same lame button-pushing mania over and over and over.

Worst of all, Prince of Persia is consistently rated and reviewed HIGHER than all-but-ignored 5-STAR FUN games like TimeShift, Dark Sector and HAZE.  So it DOES prove that a developer can throw eye-popping graphics at SOME console owners (Pacifists, Fantasy Novel Readers) and leave them flabbergasted.  How PROFESSIONAL reviewers can be sucked into this Black Hole of Deception remains one of the Great Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe!

Strip away the absolutely BRILLIANT graphics of Prince of Persia and there's NOTHING LEFT except mindless repetition with no threat of failure...Simply put the disk in, jump around and glide from canyon wall to canyon wall and then randomly push every controller button in rapid succession whenever confronted by a Bad Guy and YOU'RE THE HERO!!  Just DREADFUL...Perhaps dreadful is even too kind of a word.  Maybe UNFORGIVABLE is more appropriate.  Spend 90% of the budget on graphics, 10% on gameplay and throw in a little bit of crap-in-your-pants fear factor for the little ones.  Nice move, guys...

You'll have to find out from someone else how this one ends because when I pushed eject button, the Blu-Ray came flying out of my PS3, went out the window and flung itself onto the rocks in the creek behind our home...However, IT DID LEAVE A NOTE:

""I am so completely devoid of gaming FUN that I have decided to do the Honorable thing and never allow you to play this game again.  Do not cry for me because I have cried enough tears for the both of us.  For all of the game developers and publishers out there, PLEASE do not use the same formula responsible for my creation to release another gaming failure of this magnitude on the PS3 gaming community.  I have no redeeming value.  I am not FUN.  Therefore, I shall kill myself.  Goodbye Cruel World!""

Now I'm just one guy, but the note it left makes a whole lot of sense to me..."
205707,2,"In terms of graphics and the racing, it's fun.  But the thing that irritates me the most is always having to avoid cops and getting charged while you are cruising on career mode. It just messes up my flow in the game. I prefer Midnight Club 3 because it only includes cops during a race.  Overall, I'm very irritated by that."
428311,2,"This is my second pair of Turtle Beach headphones, and the second one to break in exactly the same way.  The plastic swivel connectors on the cups (which seem unnecessary anyway) simply do not hold up under regular use.  They last about a year, and then one of them snaps, leaving the cup dangling and the headphones useless.

I have no complaint with the sound from these headphones -- the quality is good.  I have some trouble getting them to always work right with Windows 7, because they incorporate both a headphone and speaker component, the combination of which sends Microsoft's sound software into a tailspin, but that's hardly the fault of Turtle Beach.  Any problems are generally quickly resolved.

If you're going to purchase these headphones, I recommend doing so from an outlet that will give you a two-year replacement policy.  Trust me, it will be money well spent.  Alternately, opt for Tritton or Razer products, which I understand have greater durability (Razer seems to manufacture the moving parts of most of their headsets from metal, which seems like a good plan).  For my part, Turtle Beach products have just proven too disposable for me to ever purchase them again.

EDIT: In the process of packing my PX22s up for return today, I discovered that they had also broken on the other side, the headband slide cracking in the fashion to which some other reviewers have called attention.  The swivel on the other side was also showing the white signs of plastic stress.

Upon returning the headphones, the Customer Service rep applauded me on maintaining these headphones for so long, stating that he sees customers returning Turtle Beach headsets with structural damage as few as two weeks after purchasing them.

223612,2,"I agree with several people that if you played this game as a seperate game as oppose to a sequel... you could really enjoy it.  The customization is really disappointing but the biggest flaw is how lazy the makers of this game were.  They reused SO MANY level maps!  It is really ridiculous and there are no excuses for that.  All of that aside I would have still given it a higher review if the game wouldn't have crashed so many times.  The last time it crashed I lost ALL of my character / game data.  I contacted EA and they said it was happening to a lot of people.  There was no way to restore any saves and they would give me $10 to buy another game from them.  Really?!
As much as I wanted to disagree with a lot of people's comments... it is indeed true that you should not waste your money on this game."
44733,2,"Back when SquareSoft was still an up and coming developer with a reputation for putting out consistently stellar titles, they adhered to a simple rule in developing new entries of its Final Fantasy series: *No Direct Sequels.* Sure, there were a slew of common elements that crossed over from game to game -- the play style, the aesthetic, plot themes, recurring motifs, weapons and spells, enemies, etc. -- but no new Final Fantasy game was ever built as a continuation of a previous one. Each new Final Fantasy's story, world, and characters (give or take a Gilgamesh) were designed to be exclusive and limited to that game, which was made to stand as a complete work in itself. If people clamored for an elaboration on somebody's backstory or wanted to know what happened to Cecil or Terra after they saved the world, it was up to the fanfiction and doujinshi hacks to provide it. Square was too busy creating new worlds to continue dwelling in their old ones.

One of the reasons snobs like me (re: overeducated and underemployed) tend to be so violently dismissive of sequels in books and film is because they're just too easy. It takes a considerable amount of time and sweat to create, out of nothing, a fully-formed cast of characters, a world for them to inhabit, and the complete story of the crisis that will define their lives. Most people can't do it, or can't do it well. But it takes a whole lot less work to take an old story, wind up the crank, and get it moving again (which is incidentally why fanfiction and doujin have so many practitioners).

Even though Square produced sequel after sequel, they were actually pretty bold in how they went about doing it. In addition to its steadfast refusal to listen to character-obsessive fans' demands for more of the same, Square earned international renown for reinventing what Final Fantasy was from game to game. Whereas rival developer Enix clung to a very specific formula in making its Dragon Quest games, SquareSoft liked taking risks. Final Fantasy II was a console RPG that completely nixed experience points and character levels (in 1987!). In designing Final Fantasy VI, Square brushed aside seven years of lighthearted medieval fantasy predecessors to present an apocalyptic steampunk saga with an aesthetic inspired by the European Renaissance and industrial revolution. VII ventured into cyberpunk territory during a time when RPGs were mostly rooted in basic swords n' sorcery settings, and carried with it something extremely rare in video games back then: overt social commentary. And Final Fantasy VIII -- well, regardless of how much anyone likes or dislikes VIII, it's practically a checklist of flaunted console RPG conventions.

But in 2001, SquareSoft took a risk and lost big. Enter Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the failed experiment of a movie that cost SquareSoft $98,000,000. This is not a loss anyone can walk away from easily, even a powerhouse like Square.

The instant success of Kingdom Hearts in 2002 must have come as a relief, but Square was still hurting. It would still be a few years until a Kingdom Hearts II could start generating wealth, Final Fantasy XII was stuck in a developmental purgatory, and the corporate brass was still wrangling with Enix over merger details. Square needed a quick, easy way to make money. These were desperate times... and desperate times call for direct sequels.

Like anyone crossing over to the dark side for the first time, I imagine the folks at Square must have been astounded at how incredibly easy it was putting together Final Fantasy X-2. The story was already 80% written, considering how there was no need to pay a brain trust of artists and writers to design an original fantasy world and its history from scratch. There was likewise no need to pump tens of millions into a budget towards programming and map design, since virtually all the areas from X could just be recycled and thrown into X-2 as they were. (In order to keep from looking completely cheap and lazy, they did design three attractive new areas, expanded a few old ones, and whipped up some simple textures for a handful of assorted unimportant ""branching paths and dead ends"" dungeons that could be assembled with your most basic level editor software.) The character models and animations? Recycled from X. Monster models and animations? Recycled from X. Battle effects animations? As many as possible recycled from X. Battle system? Well, rehashing X's might have been too obvious, so they went ahead and used a bootleg, watered-down version of Grandia's instead. And as for the practical considerations, they probably reckoned they could amp up sales amongst female gamers if all of X-2 featured all-female player characters, and they could do it without scaring off male consumers as long as Yuna and her friends showed a lot of skin. It's equally likely that Yuna's redesign was implemented with Lara Croft's enduring popularity in the overseas market in mind. And it probably wasn't until a bit later that they decided to additionally feature her in glamorous pop performance sequences that would lend themselves to television ads and soundtrack sales, and increase the game's overall marketability, since glitzy commercial pop was huge on both sides of the Pacific.

Final Fantasy X-2 began development in early 2002 and was released in Japan in March of 2003. It has sold somewhere in the neighborhood of four million copies worldwide, and has 86% and 85% rankings on Game Rankings and Metacritic. IGN gives it a 9.5, calling it ""brilliant and addictive"" and praising Square for ""finally beginning to listen to the outcries of its fans"" and producing a direct sequel, while Gamespot calls X-2 ""every bit as poignant, endearing, and engrossing as its forebears."" The now-defunct Official U.S. Playstation Magazine evidently gave it 10 out of 10 -- a perfect score.

Critics. What do they know?

~THE STORY~

Every opening to every Final Fantasy game more or less epitomizes the whole experience following it. Final Fantasy X-2, sadly, is no exception. The truest mark of Square Stockholm Syndrome is buying X-2, saying ""what in God's name was that?"" at the intro, and still deciding to go ahead and give the rest of the game a shot. Fans of Final Fantasy X might already be complaining that throwing a pop concert for a throng of adoring fans is tremendously out of character for X's vestal heroine -- but hold the phone! The Yuna we see onstage is actually her sneaky rival Leblanc, who has stolen her garment grid and is posing as Yuna to throw a sold-out pop concert and smear her image in the public eye.

...

Anyway, so after Rikku and Paine chase Leblanc around a while, our modest, clergy-raised priestess Yuna finally shows up to set the record straight and prove she hasn't sold out by backflipping onto the scene in a halter top and hot pants and unloading a few clips into her rivals' faces. Sass is exchanged, poses are struck, Yuna reclaims her garment grid, and she and her buddies victoriously return to their airship.

Nowadays, Yuna is running with the Al-Bhed side of her extended family. Calling themselves the Gullwings, they travel Spira's skies in Brother's souped-up flying eyesore and scour the world for spheres, the home movies of the ancients. See, at the end of Final Fantasy X International, Yuna discovers a sphere containing a video of someone who looks and sounds exactly like her vaporized boyfriend and wants to see if she can find more information about him. Secure in the belief that her beloved blonde beau still out there somewhere alive and whining, Final Fantasy X's heroine, dons her hot pants, halter top and combat boots, grabs a pair of pistols, and embarks on a quest for the truth with all the sass, charm, and you-go-girl power she can muster.

Since Final Fantasy X-2 gives you the airship right from the get-go, the first chapter consists of tracking down new spheres and stopping by familiar locations from X to how Spira's changed over the last two years. The first sphere is in Besaid, where you can catch up with two of Yuna's old party members (gothic superbabe Lulu and her pudgy, sports coach bumpkin of a husband Wakka). Sphere number two is in Zanarkand, where you can watch Yuna and Rikku yell at Cid for turning the ruins (formerly the single most remote and sacred location on the planet) into a tourist attraction. If you care enough, you can also swing by Gagazet and visit Kimahri, who rules over the Ronso tribe by standing around with his arms crossed and making limp pronouncements in slow, broken English.

Even though Final Fantasy X-2's main plot and characters are a bust, its subtext can actually be sort of interesting. The game's world is a familiar one, as it revisits Spira after the end of Sin, the fall of Yevon, and the rise of technology; but it was also designed with this world in mind. In spite of their best efforts, X-2's developers do show some cleverness in designing a fantasy world that appears more and more like our own the more we explore it.

At the end of Final Fantasy X, Spira managed to pull itself out of a thousand-year dark age by casting off religion and destroying the planet-ravaging monster Sin for good. Two years later, society is fragmented, leaderless, and entering the nascent stages of a rapid technological revolution that's already having unintended consequences. The people aren't quite sure what to do with themselves now that they're not constantly fleeing for their lives and rebuilding their destroyed villages every other week. The former Yevon faithful are struggling to find meaning in their lives now that their religion has been pretty much completely debunked -- and most of them are finding it in consumerism and hedonism. Also, the forests are dying, the ice is melting, and the music everyone listens to sucks.

 Does any of this sound maybe a little familiar to anyone? No?

 Perhaps I read too much into things.

 In any event, Final Fantasy X-2 would be a vastly improved experience if it were more like Final Fantasy I in conveying its story. Were all the character-driven melodrama slashed and burned, leaving the player to explore and figure out the game's world on their own, X-2 might not be so unrelentingly irritating. Unfortunately, since we do have to cope with the aforementioned character-driven melodrama, the weak plot, and the dozens of piddling subplots tied to the dozens of piddling sidequests in order to get a picture of what's going on in Spira, the disparate interesting bits are really just the sprig of parsley on a giant dollop of grease.

~THE GAME~
""yah the story's not so good but the gameplay is pretty alright""

I've read a number of different reviews and articles concerning this game that all tend to contain some variation of the above sentence. Sure, X-2 might be the hot springs episode of the Final Fantasy series, but it also features a brand new iteration of the job system. As long as the character building and battle systems are about on par with the Final Fantasy V, which was great fun to play in spite of its lightweight story, doesn't X-2 deserve the same kind of credit?

First, some words on the new battle and job systems. X-2 is back to using the old ATB system, but it also mixes in some elements from the Grandia games. Characters' and enemies relatives locations on the screen are more important than before: a character with a melee job will attack more quickly if her target is closer, and certain special attacks have a range of effect that additional targets can duck out of, provided they're far enough away from the main target. It sounds neat, but since there are so few of these attacks and there's no way to move characters aside from using the ""fight"" command, this mechanic rarely makes any significant difference in battle. Also borrowed from Grandia is the purple ""wait time"" bar, a new ATB gauge function. When a party member or enemy uses a special attack, there is a buffer period between when the ability is selected and its activation. This means that abilities are no longer instantaneous; they can be interrupted and delayed. But while Grandia's system is specially structured around this mechanic, X-2 seems to have just tacked it on mid-development, and it usually doesn't make much of a difference in anything. (For example, the Alchemist's charge time for her Stash command is tremendous, and she's still the game's most useful healbot. Likewise, the Warrior and Samurai's attack-delaying abilities are virtually useless.)

And we have the new job system. Final Fantasy X-2 doesn't call them jobs, though -- I guess because that would be too unglamorous, too evocative of dirty fingernails. Instead, our teen girl squad equips ""dresspheres"", which change their clothes and thereby alter their special abilities. There's no mixing and matching abilities between outfits like in V or Tactics (barring the use of special accessories or garment grids), but X-2's spin on the job system is that it allows the girls to switch dresspheres in mid-battle, resulting in sparkly and glamorous Sailor Moon-esque transformation sequences (whose twenty-second lengths can thankfully be abridged or cut altogether through an option in the config menu). There are fourteen dresspheres in all, and X-2 does a commendable job of balancing them by setting their number of learnable abilities at fifteen (though there are a few loopholes).

Sounds great, right? But the truth is, this is all just the setup for another hilarious SquareEnix designer joke. The punchline is that Final Fantasy X-2 really wants you to participate in as few battles as possible. Whereas the earlier job-based game Final Fantasy V (heck, and Final Fantasy X for that matter) bombards players with a multitude of difficult and tricky fights, X-2 would rather we spend the bulk of our time watching cutscenes and playing minigames than doing those things that Final Fantasy X-2's exciting what's-it-called system was designed for. Unless you really go out of your way -- and X-2 rather expects you to, judging by the preponderance of minigames and sidequests -- you're not really going to be doing that much fighting (except when you're battling Leblanc's goofy henchmen, Logos and Ormi, over and over and over and over and over again during the first two chapters).

Most of the time when you swoop over a location on the world map and accept a mission, someone approaches Yuna and drafts her into putting on a moogle suit and selling balloons to tourists. Or selling concert tickets to tourists hanging around the river. Or approaching NPCs and trying to guess the correct sales pitch that will compel them to go to one of the Calm Lands' two amusement park companies. Or chasing butterflies. Or chasing chocobos. Or chasing British people. If you're not selling something or chasing something, you're fighting sequential battles against clusters of human opponents that drop after two hits. (And sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll get to fight sequential battles against packs of the same three or four basic monsters in different configurations.) Then you watch a cutscene you might as well skip, get an item, and board the airship to search out more fun.

At least there's the Via Infinito, Chapter 5's huge optional dungeon: a hundred randomly-generated maps of unavoidable random battles and boss fights every twenty levels. The deeper you go, the harder it gets. Of course, in order to finish it, you'll need to grind your way up to around level 80 (at least). And you'll need to spend a bunch of extra hours stealing and bribing and getting enough amusement park points to stockpile all the items you'll need to see you through floors 80-100 and the last few superbosses. You know, you might as well just go ahead and finish the game so you can come back to the Via Infinito during New Game+. I couldn't bring myself to try, but I'm told it's totally worth all the time and trouble -- and it's required if you want to get the good ending.

There's also Sphere Break, X-2's incarnation of the collectible, number-based Triple Triad and Tetra Master card games from Final Fantasy VIII and IX. What are the rewards for playing and mastering Sphere Break? Well, beating Shinra -- the toughest player in the game -- is the only way to acquire the gambler job. Aside from that? Well, that depends on whether you consider the thrill of spending hours digging around in the desert for more game spheres and playing the same group of NPCs in the same location a reward in itself. You don't? Boy are you behind the times.

Oh, and blitzball is back. Did I mention that blitzball is back? It is.

I don't even know what else to say here. I really can't think of a single reason beyond the Job System why anyone should ever play Final Fantasy X-2. It's surely the most incoherent Square game I've ever played -- the thing just can't decide what it wants to be. It wants to have a strong central plot, but is designed so that the bulk of the experience consists of optional little sidequests with optional little subplots. It wants the player to enjoy its exciting and well-designed (if not in need of a little polishing) battle system, but the game is built so that the player has to spend all his time participating in a variety of inane minigames instead. It wants to be lighthearted and somber, comedic and bittersweet all at once, and the designers just weren't capable of succeeding in that sort of balancing act -- especially considering how short a development cycle they were working with. (One year. The last Final Fantasy game that took only a year to develop was V, on the Super Famicom.) None of Square's work from the last decade or so has been very consistent, but Final Fantasy X-2 is something else. You'd almost suspect the corporate brass had it slapped together, crammed full of fanservice, and shipped out quickly as possible to help offset some huge financial deficit or something. At any rate, if you wanted to identify the Final Fantasy game that pinpoints, closely as possible, the period when Square finally and iredeemably ""sold out,"" X-2 would be it.

And so I leave you with one final fun fact: Final Fantasy X-2's director, Motomu Toriyama, is also the director and scenario writer for Final Fantasy XIII. Hmm."
73180,2,"I bought this xbox 360 December of 2006 and from day one have babied it and made sure it got lots of air circulation because of all the stories of overheating that i read about. But with all the gentle care i have given this thing it has self destructed recently (3 red lights). I was just amazed and dumbfounded that a company like Microsoft could release a high priced piece of equipment like this onto the market when it should still be in the lab getting hardware/software problems resolved.

Some of the games like Gears of War are really awsum and a lot of fun. But be prepared to pay the price for the good times because in my opinion its not if it will break, its when it will break.

I have worked with PC's for 12 years now and have gone through all the problems Microsoft has released with every new version of their operating system. I should have known that the Xbox 360 would be no different. Its a shame that Microsoft has released such a problamatic system like this on the market, and its not just me, all my friends that have this unit have had to send their machine in for repair at some point. Just do a google search for xbox 360 and you will find a huge amount of people complaining of failures.

I for one have learned my lesson, i am done spending money on anything Xbox, no more games (i will rent instead) and no more investment in options. I have 500 dollars worth of Xbox 360 and games that are a doorstop right now. My unit is under warrenty and microsoft is sending me a shipping box so that i my get repairs made as needed, but my POINT is... this 3 month old machine that i have only used for about 30 hours is broken and unusable when i needed it for out of town company.

Beware of anything, Micrsoft!"
39010,2,"I got this game thinking the multiplayer would be like Agent Under Fire's, only with bots so i could play alone or cooperatively with friends.  What I liked about Agent Under Fire were the following options in multiplayer:  speed adjustment, gravity adjustment, Q-jet, Q-claw.  All of these things have been left out of Nightfire!!!  Granted, some of the new options are kinda cool, such as the remote-controlled helicopters and tanks and especially the guided missiles, but these things lose their charm pretty quickly.  I am VERY disappointed.  The movement in multiplayer is EXTREMELY slow, which is just accentuated by the fact that many of the levels are impressively large.  Aiming is awkward.  In general the gameplay pales in comparison to HALO or Timesplitters (1 or 2).  The single player levels are larger and better looking than AUF's, but I'm not really into running around trying to find computers to plant Q-worms on and such, so I lost interest fast.  This is a rental at best, since even if you enjoy the missions you can finish them all in a few sittings."
210205,2,"Recently got the RAT7 and all I can say is it is the best mouse I have ever used. I have used many mice from all the big companies...logitech, razor, MS, and all I can say is this is the best. The ability to shape this mouse to your hands shape is what sets it above the others. I have a wide hand with short fingers. I never could get a mouse that fit the way I liked it, until this one. If you are in the market for A top of the line mouse...and you have had problems getting a good fit, look into this mouse, I believe you will be presently surprised like I was.

 edit 1....Have had the rat for a week now. It does not work right on an exactmat mousepad. It has tracking problems when lifting off the pad. Went back to a piece of formica I had and voila...it works perfect. I am now ordering a new mouse pad. :(

second edit...mouse had to be returned. When you picked it up and set it back down, the scroll wheel button, and, or the right click button would click by themselves. After using this I would have to say not worth it....sorry. Going back to my old death adder which still works great....just want more buttons and adjustable dpi...

Amazon return service was great as usual...thanks."
342545,2,Really dissapointed witb how it feels. It works fine but feels bulky and cheap.
117572,2,"Gears of War is a game that could have been great....but fell far short.
I hope you like staring at a black, white and gray screen for hours at a time because that is about the only colors you are going to see throughout the whole game!!!

Ever play a first person shooter before? Nothing new here. I am not going into the minutiae like some people do. Here is the whole picture synopsis.

This game offers something different in the way of weapons and the movements of your character. You do and don't get the typical machine gun. Yes, it is a machine gun but it feels and sounds solid and futuristic when playing this game.  Your movements are interesting. You can cling to, duck behind and walk along walls for cover like you have always wanted to. Peek out, shoot around the corner then duck back behind it.

Sadly, that is the whole scheme of the game...peek, shoot and duck. Wash, rinse, repeat. Thankfully, the enemy will try to flank you, run right up to you and throw grenades at you. That definitely keeps it exciting.

Tell you more about the grenades? OK. They are cool looking, they are powerful and the throwing system is unique. And it is also very disappointing! You hold your Mouse 2 button to create a ""throw path"" for the grenade to follow. When ready, you click the Mouse 1 button to throw it and BOOM! This works great when you are on level ground. In many cases, the camera angles for the throwing system completely prevent you from seeing where you are throwing the grenade. Effectively neutralizing your aim. Also, you can only carry 4!!! Yes, a measly 4 grenades.

Which brings us to ammo. There are no health power ups or armor power ups to go hunting for. You automatically regenerate these when you are not being shot. AWESOME! Ammo is abundant and you can pick up your dead enemies weapons, allowing you to switch weapons and stock ammo to your hearts content. Again - AWESOME!

The biggest SUCK factors of this game are as follows -
Video is excellent but the colors are only gray, black and white.
Game play is fast and fun but it gets repetitive.
No save system. Checkpoints....YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The game is entirely scripted so you know when the enemy is coming every time.
When you die, you are forced to go through some of the same cut scenes over and over!!! Some can be skipped, others cannot!!!!!
It feels like they ported it from the XBOX 360 instead of making a solid version developed specifically for the PC.

Overall, it was OK. Not bad, not great. I played a friend's copy so luckily I did not have to actually pay for it. I definitely don't think it is worth $45. Maybe $30. No way would I pay more."
162441,2,"After several weeks of playing this game, I have lowered my score. I originally rated it a 3, but I am revising that score down now that I have seen how terribly one dimensional this game is in Hell and Inferno. What a massive disappointment this game turned out to be.

I really want to rate this game higher than a 3 (later lowered to 2), but some core features limit its appeal.

Unlike previous Diablo outtings, this not a single player game. It is a MMO/single-player hybrid. In order to play, you must maintain a constant connection to the battle.net servers. While this sounds fine in theory, it means if your internet connection is less than ideal, you face the possibility of being unable to use abilities because of lag or (much worse) being kicked from the game. Being kicked from Diablo 3 is especially frustrating for the reason below:

Unlike a ""real"" MMO, when you are kicked from Diablo 3 your quest progress is only partially saved and you are sent back to the start of the area. A spell of lag during a boss fight means you might very well be booted all the way back to town. While there are teleporters available to get you closer to your objective, people with unpredictable connections are likely to be very frustrated. As of this writing, 15 seconds of lag or so is usually enough to get booted. (This is ignoring the various issues that have plagued the Battle.net servers since the game's release, which obviously magnifies the problem.)

The actual multi-player is a mixed bag. There are some significant improvements from previous Diablo games and from WoW: all loot is individual (no rolling for gear or fighting over who gets to pick up an item, if you see it, it's yours). However, it is not possible to search for games to join directly. Being kicked from a game in progress means that unless you know the global names of the players you were teamed with, you are unable to rejoin that specific game. That means, again, if you are halfway through a quest and get booted, the next game you join probably means doing everything over again (although you do get to keep your items and experience).

Seemingly gone from the game entirely are stats, specs, skill trees or anything that would resemble character customization. Your character gets 6 spells or abilities, of which there are approximately 8 variations. Some of these variations change the power drastically, others change the power in a modest way. For example, one of the Wizard's Magic Missile variations simply improves the damage of Magic Missile. You are able to swap your powers around at almost any time. New variations of powers automatically unlocked as you level. Because of this, there is seemingly little reason to play through Diablo 3 more than once per class, because once powers are unlocked you can switch to them at any time. While this alleviates some of the frustration of Diablo 2's over-complex build system,it may limit replay value and sense of ownership for the player.

Previous Diablo games did not allow customization of the player-avatar, but that was more understandable due to the use of sprites instead of 3-d models. Diablo 3 is entirely 3-D, but you still must play using the pre-designed models. You are not even allowed to recolor hair/skin or add/remove beards, which at least would have established a bare minimum of ownership.

Graphics and sound are good, occcasionally exceptional. Fights are fluid and fun overall. Assuming there is no lag, the game responds fluidly to player inputs. Each act of the game is fairly long. Unlike previous Diablos, a significant number of ""drop in"" on you using creative animations (e.g. skeletons climbing up the sides of the maze).

Combat now includes the possibility of interacting with the environment in limited ways. For example, you can cut the cord on chandliers to drop them on enemy's heads, or knock supporting pilons out, causing walls to crumble on enemies. Although these moments in some ways have a tendency to feel ""scripted"" the animations involved are stunning.

Among the best improvements versus D1 and 2 are a significant reduction in ""inventory Tetris"" and potion management mini-games. It is also often far less required that the player return to town to restock on gear. Arrows are infinite. There are no ""mana potions"" as mana returns on its own fairly quickly or via abilities.

Should you buy Diablo 3? It depends on what $60 is worth to you. Overall I think there is a pretty good game in there trying to get out. Blizzard is known for post-release tweaks, so its possible several issues may get patched up. However, as of release date, the game could stand some improvement."
49817,2,"The Myst series are such beautiful games and I was so excited that they were released on DVD specifically for XP.  The excitement lasted about 15 minutes into my first playing. . .
Despite the fact that it is supposed to be made for XP, I am still experiencing a LOT of trouble running it.  In several different places in Myst, it crashes to desktop--bad thing when those places are pertinent to solving!
As of this date, 16 May 2004, there is STILL no patch availble, or any signs that UbiSoft is working on the problem."
193919,2,"I went through hell with this adapter. All I wanted was to be able to play games for let's plays on my computer. None of my N64 controllers worked right with it. First, the joystick acted loose, while it acted normal on the actual console. I bought three different controllers from a local game shop. None of them worked. The shop started just swapping the controllers for me when they realized how much trouble I was having, thinking it was on their end. I went through perhaps seven controllers before finally taking this thing apart and discovering that the contact points inside were corroded.
I take good care of my stuff. Both my parents took great pains while bringing me up to teach me to respect my stuff, and my dad being an engineer on top of it made me extra aware of what not to do with electronic devices. So whatever caused this to become corroded, I know, was a manufacturer's fault.
I was extremely disappointed by this turn of events, and the adapter went headlong into the trash can. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for an N64 controller adapter."
449287,2,"A video game of weirdness....  Konami must have been searching for a specific audience in the USA.  Its an odd game because of the odd graphics, strange story line (ninja cats? ok....), side scrolling and 3d gaming, and a host of mini-games.  As a matter of fact there is one whole level that all you do is play mini-games!  Wait, that sounds pretty good actually.  And the game has some fun elements, but its just way too hard to really inspire much replay.  It never really caught on here like it did Japan. Interesting game, but more of an oddity than a classic."
50363,2,"We'll ignore for the moment that I don't particularly enjoy fighting games.  The graphics and backgrounds were beautiful, and the game managed to keep me entertained for four or five hours before it went back on the shelf to never see the light of day again.
First of all, all of the maneuvers and combinations were just too much.  The game would have been made much more playable if there had been a real training area.  What it had was a guy who would stand there and let you hit him as you tried to reproduce the sometimes rediculous button combinations posted on the screen.  It would have been great if there had been a martial arts master to instruct you and fight against you as he taught you the moves.
Second is the story, or lack there-of.  Dead or Alive 3 tries to present itself as a story, even having a few exchanges between the characetrs as you move through it, but you'd have to already know the story for it to make any sense. All you do is beat up the opponents, listen to a couple snips of dialog, and fight the end of level villain at the end.  It has about as much story as Gotham Racing.
As beating people up was a matter of perfecting two or three maneuvers for each character, the fighting quickly became passe.  The story wasn't.  All in all the beautiful graphics were wasted in a game that had nothing going for it.  DoD Extreme Beach Volleyball has more plot then this game."

273548,2,"Ok where to begin? Let me start off by saying that I for many years loved and enjoyed the COD games and have been playing since the release of COD II. As most of you reading this probably already are fans of the Franchise you know how fun these games have been in the past and how they seem to be entertaining seemingly until the next COD where flaws have been patched and a better experience (at least in your mind) should take place, right? Before I say my piece, let me just say that this game was not terrible. In fact, for the first few weeks it was very fun. But their are many, many short comings that I have recently noticed that are giving me a painfully frustrating headache.

  So first lets talk about the good news. Ok, so the good news is this people. Treyarch has clearly made the guns much, much better! How? Well for one things if we can remember on a recap back to Black Ops one we can remember the completely random recoil profiles of the guns. Ooooh yes! Our crowd favorite the Uzi was one of our shining examples, as well as the Dragonov, RPK, and so many others. In fact it seems that the only guns people consistantly used were the AK 74U, Galil, Famas, Aug, M16, Skorpian, Spectre, and WA2000 or the other bolt sniper which name escapes me. But considering that Black ops one gave us so many other guns to choose from, one must really scratch their heads and wonder why. Well its very simple; all the other guns had major shortcomings... in the way of recoil profiles! How frustrated were you when you unlocked that UZI the first time on to see how terrible it was. Why was it that the Dragonov, which shot a smaller round than some of the other snipers had such nasty recoil? So much variety, but so little to choose from. No one really tried using the others because they were highly out claseed and often got the users killed quick! Aside from that most of the guns were freakin clones with laser beams NOT attached to their freakin heads!

  Well anyways, in this game guns are very well balanced, and while the choices are fewer, each gun has more of its own personality to appease to players of all kinds. and I do praise Treyarch for that! Not only that but many of these guns are Futuristic, as are the innovative kill streaks, which btw I gotta say were the best laid out in any COD game to date! Also the graphics seem improved and their is a lot less strain on the eyes if you intend to play for long hours. I don't want to spoil the campaign for those who have yet to buy it but I will say this....SOOO much better than the first Black ops or MW3 campaign IMHO. You even get to create your class before going on missions and you can actually feel some emotions again in the story for once! That said, for me at least the best Campaign still goes to WAW. But that's just me and to each his own. Zombies btw if that's your thing (not mine) is the best yet!

  Sadly that's about all the good I can say for this game. Now allow me to tell you of the Sad and Frustrating truth.....this game is completely...UNFAIR IN MULTIPLAYER! In case you didn't already know the game will LAG, LAG, LAG, LAAAAAAAGGGGGG! I have and excellent connection! Fastest of the fast, no joke! But since others you play with have garbage connections....well guess what that means? As bad as they have it....its gonna be a whole lot worst for you! You get to feel like your back in the age of the Dinosaurs (aka Era of Dial Up) and get to have the luxury of being slowed by this whole lag compensation TRASH! Yep! Its sad and unfair but who cares right? That awesome K/D you once had is gone! Gone with the Wind! For the first 2 weeks I had a K/D of 3.03! That sounds good right? Well actually its because A) They made it harder to camp (Props Treyarch) B) Noob Tubing still gone C) It is very hard to quick scope in this game D) all the guns are pretty much evened out or rather none are over powered. In other words this game takes SKILL (for once, thank you Jesus)! But after all the lags my K/D was down up until today at 1.48.....now its down to 1.42....why? (And btw please keep in mind I pre-ordered and received day of), because the game LAGS too damn much! I cant so much as aim down my freaking sights now with out it getting so glitchy and laggy! It takes almost 5 seconds sometimes just to see down my own sights!

 Whats worse, is when you shoot at someone and nothing happens! You just drop dead and are like, ""WTF""! After you got a ton of hit markers and they should have been dead but NOOOOOOPE! Also the servers suck! Constantly the hosts are being changed, sometimes as much as 4-5 times! And its not like when the game gets going again its like a 4-5 second count down pause, oh no! Sometimes up to 30 seconds! Thats crazy! Not to mention everyone stuck on the damn load screens for 15-20 seconds before that. So we all get pissed off! You cant leave the game at that point, and even if you could its the same every single other game you go to. Mind you this was not the case the first 3 weeks after the release! It started happening to me early last week! And being that I play every night you can kinda see how one gets thoroughly pissed off by this. I come home after work, make dinner for the family, walk the dog, finally sit down, only to be greeted by this S^&*! I'm done! Unless they patch it, I'm out and I will never buy another Treyarch game, no matter how good it looks, or how hyped up it is! No so long as I do so breathe on this earth!

  So let this be a warning to everyone who still hasn't bought this game. WAIT! DO not buy this game as it is right now! Wait another month or two and look up the latest reviews online before even considering this product. If not, just be in store for painful headaches and constant frustration. I for one have stopped playing all together in the last 48 hours and have been coming home to Netflix. I have to admit it is a whole lot better than the aggravtion I have gotten from this game! So I really hope this helps someone out there decide if they want to buy this game. Dont get me wrong the game isn't terrible but I do not recommend playing it until it is patched (if they patch it) or unless you just wanna play Zombies and the Campaign which are both very good!"
162083,2,"The predecessor - D2 was a fun game. Blizzard released a low quality product - diablo 3. Not only it required constant online connection which is annoying ( I experienced multiple disconnects, and character floating on map to previous position due to blizzards low quality service, not my connection) I was finished with the main story line within less than a week (played couple hours each day)
Another issue I had with the game is security. Because of the always connected stupid requirement my account got hacked 3 times, and each time the annoying blizzard customer service responded ""fixing"" the issue with a pathetic childish mannerism, also trying to up sell its ""security keyfobs"" , obviously they want people to waste money on yet another worthless product. This game should not require an always on connection at all, unless one wants to play with others. As to the story, its very forgettable, the boses are not fun, and are easy to kill. All the hype is not equal to the quality of this product. After buying this low quality product I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BLIZZARD PRODUCT AGAIN!

STAY AWAY! DO NOT BUY if your looking for quality!"
290611,2,"From the begging game, boring"
97270,2,This one shouldve stayed with just one. GR was fun. This one was just ok. I felt that the added features were just inconviniences that slowed the game down. Not the best tactical shooter.
111163,2,"I just bought my first Ps3 on Dec 2009 and I decided to start from the beginning so I bought not only 2009 games but 2008, 2007 and even 2006 also. I love hack n' slash games but I think I am late for this game, probably I would love it if I've played it 2 years ago, but on Dec 2009 this is just a mediocre hack n' slash. There is a lot of blood and gore wich is great but the gameplay is not enough."
150717,2,"I was waiting this game many years, and finally I had a bad surprise.
A really really bad story, a repetitive gameplay, an uninspired concept. I gave 2 stars just because technically is well constructed. But of course that is not enough, the game is below average."
215736,2,"Ugh, there was some good work put into this game but its just not right. The physics are by far my biggest beef with this game. The cars just don't seem to act like they would in the real world....not even close. See my review of driver san francisco, the reason I love that game is the physics are excellent. This game also is very locked up unless you have time to game (I really don't have much) or pay for more content. Bummed I just purchased this."
438308,2,"The Modern Warfare remastered is a 10/10, however the stand alone COD game is atrocious.  Not only is it a carbon copy of Black Ops 3, the game looks like a  piece of flat toast.  No way in the world did the game take three years to make.  If it weren't for the title difference I would think this is black ops three.  Absolutely positively not even worth $20 let alone $70."
352085,2,"I really wanted to like this game. I love action rpgs, but this game became very repetitive. The story was mediocre. The controls on a vita were also weird. I would try it on the ps tv, but that would not make a difference as far as the repetitive gameplay. I will say that I like customizing the characters, and if you play it with friends, it is slightly better."
374494,2,I love cod every year I play this game but t this time im very disappoint it campaign is great but the multiplayer is worse ever for one kil I got kill 3 times over u can even aim properly maps are not done right people moving too fast u face people face to face frequently is not very fun game to play!!!!!
481023,2,"I have been playing the game for 3 hours now on a NEW 3ds which is more powerful than the 3ds that was available when the game got released. Even with the NEW 3ds, the game lag when there is music. It's very disappointing.

The video and dialog between games are very slow and not skippable until you finish the mission. It means that you have to ""wait"" between 3 minutes to 5 minutes between 20 minutes of game play. It makes the game pace to get slow. I tried to get into the game story but all the Japanese names make it impossible to remember who is who. This is also a problem in game when you need to figure out who to save or to kill.

The mechanic of the game is a little bit hard to understand even if there is some explanation in the game's booklet. There is many attack and power attack but some of them never seem to get trigged as supposed. Maybe it requires more than 3 hours to get it or I might just not get it.

Enemies are very easy or very hard. I find it hard to get middle ground enemies. Most of them just stand there and wait to get hit. However, some targeted enemies can be super hard.

At the end, this game is relaxing. You do not need to follow much the story, just start it and hit and smash everybody. You will kill around 500+ people during each mission. It's repetitive for sure and if 3 hours is 1%, I can see that the whole game is an endeavor of over 100 hours (to be determined). I'll give it a chance and see how it goes but so far, I doubt I will complete this game."
34184,2,"i don't have a lot to say except that the game is frustrating and dark.
i know this is not helpful but i just wanted to express myself."
125388,2,"Great game, but did not arrive as promised... Amazon came through for me tho.."
400570,2,"To start off, this is a good game. It it just not a good ""underground"" racing game like EA said it was going back to. This game is pretty fun but lacks a lot of what I assumed would have been in the game.

The racing in Need for speed was a lot of fun. It is pretty easy to get in and win some races. Also the graphics are top notch and game does look amazing. The cars the game has in it have great detail, plus some pretty cool but limited things to customize. The story is decent enough and cut scenes do look nice, as they are filmed like a movie with real people.

Now my issues with the game would make me for sure not purchase it. I was 100% going to buy this ahead of time but lucky me I have the EA Pass and was able to do the 10 hour trail. After the trail I have changed my mind and decided to save my money.

Starting off, this game requires it to always be online when playing. I find this funny as there is pretty much zero multiplayer unless you are playing with friends who also have the game. Just like the last Need for Speed title, it is a single player game that happens to have other random players driving around the huge open world, so occasionally you might see one drive by you. There is no option to jump into a game room with your customized car and do sprint races or anything else with random people. The story mode is fine but the actual acting is painful to watch with the words bae, dope, monster energy drinks at every turn, and just making the race community look like idiots.

My other issue is that apparently you have loads of customization options.. NOT TRUE! My second vehicle purchase I found this out. I was not able to change the hood, front or rear bumpers, grill, or even side skirts. I was left with one body kit, a spoiler and rims, oh and side fenders. Each area you can change has maybe 2 options such as if the car has the option to change a front bumper, you will have two to choose from.  Also the car selection is something around 30 cars if I am not mistaken. I would be fine with the small car selection if I was actually able to fully customize the cars in all aspects rather than a very select few.

This was a game I really did wish I liked. This is a fun racing game but again, if you were wanting a game like the older underground series or even Carbon, you will be disappointed. With the lack of any multiplayer, very little customization compared to older underground/carbon games, and annoying acting with too much product placement, this game gets a sad two stars from me.

My advice, get the EA pass for five bucks for a month and do the 10 hour trial."
195425,2,"My 6 year old son liked this game in the beginning. The graphics are okay, nothing great. The game play is good at first but gets boring quickly There is no real challenge. The worst part about this game is that you cannot adjust or fine tune the aiming and for us we have to point the gun to the right of center in order to be centered. This is REALLY annoying and that inaccuracy is just terrible. The ""red reveal"" filter is a nice addition and makes it somewhat more interesting. My 6 year old liked it for the first 20 minutes, the rest of us were not pleased at all....and pretty bored. You do not have the ability to move as you please. After spending a decent amount of time reviewing this, I am very comfortable recommending a pass, unless you have very young children (and even then I'm not so sure).  The little nerf gun comes with 3 nerf darts. They have a soft tip and travel several feet. They are perfect size to catch you right in the eye, so, BE CAREFUL, especially with children around (and since I cannot imagine old kids or adults enjoying this for too long I wonder what's the point). Also, you cannot use the darts and the wii remote simultaneously. The darts are for playing as a regular nerf gun only. As for 3 ways to play, that is a little deceptive because the ""Red Reveal Tech,"" is really a red filter that shows different information in the game.  MY guess is this will be greatly discounted soon, and at half the price, this would be ok (just ok), however, at this point it's an easy pass. Please note I spent several hours on this game, way past my sons interest, in the interest of a fair review. My sympathies to EA and Nerf (two companies who usually put out great products)....you can't win them all."

Not recommended for fighting games"
123217,2,"Sega's Golden Axe series was once a revered franchise in the 16-bit days, then just seemed to die off as new generations of consoles came and went.  Golden Axe: Beast Rider attempts to put a new spin on Sega's classic series, and utterly fails.  Playing as returning heroine Tyris Flare, you are on a journey of revenge against the evil Death Adder.  There are hordes of enemies to duke it out with and dismember, but the game is pretty much a bore from beginning to end.  Not because of the gameplay itself per se, but just how the game is designed.  There are some good looking environments and effects, but much of what you see in Golden Axe just looks bland.  It doesn't help that the game's controls are awkward (and occasionally unresponsive) during combat, and especially when trying to handle the game's assortment of beasts.  The few high points of Golden Axe are that the game is quite brutal in terms of bloody violence, and there is a decently lengthed quest as well.  Getting through it however is a different story all together.  One last thing though: where is the co-op mode?  I seem to remember half the fun of the old Golden Axe games was teaming up with a pal, and there is no such thing to be found here.  All in all, no matter how much of a fan you may be of the original, classic Golden Axe, Golden Axe: Beast Rider is an ultimate failure that doesn't live up to the pedigree of the original in the least, and in the end is best left on the shelf."
444004,2,"I have to give only 2 star so people will not get too excited about this game. In reality, I can give 3~4 starts based on the overall story line.

I played this game in PS3 version and completed it. The story line and the sub-story lines are all good, but sort of repeating after 1/2 of the game........

This game has A LOT OF BUGS AND THE MANUFACTURE NEVER THINK TO FIX IT BY RELEASING PATCHES --- this is the main reason why I only give 2 stars.

I have encounters many bugs in my play thorough and wasted more than 20 hours of time only because the bugs caused me have to restart missions (or cannot finish them) several times.  There are also bugs then in certain place, you will just freeze and forced to restart the console ---in the bad way (hard reboot).  I almost break the disk and throw to the trash can. It is just that bad.

Again, music and graphic and story are all good, but the GAME, which is the MAIN PART, is just a piece or crap. I have played video games over 20 years and experienced many manufactures and genus, this game is the fist that ever makes me want to give such poor review."
76363,2,"Ive bought this game 2 different times and both times have disappointed me, it's a beautiful game, with a great soundtrack, but the story is really stupid and non original, its really fun when you first play it, but it really lacks any replay value, once you've already gotten all of the clothes and jewlery (which isn't much) there's nothing to do. Just drive around and do the boring side missions. When you first play its fun just to rob people and make money to buy clothes."
236249,2,Bought a bundle and this the only game came in with it.  Not my fault that part lol.  I would never buy dumb games such as this.  Yes it look cool when you play with it.  I am not feeling this.  Even my 6 years old daughter doesn't like this game.  Sony must know that no one would buy this game so instead they add it in this bundle lol.
137624,2,I am a Rock Band3 enthusiast. I play a keyboard and so am not really interested in playing Rock Band 1. I am more interested in importing the music than playing the game. gameplay on RB1 is crude at best. Having to jump through a bunch of setlists to unlock all the music seems stupid to me at best.
17570,2,"I purchased Black and White on the advice of a friend and was told about the fun aspects of training a pet. After playing for several hours I can honestly say I was underwhelmed.

While the game's graphics were good, and I had fun for about an hour playing around with my pet and the world, there was little to keep my interest. I quickly moved onto other games and forget that I had purchased Black and White. For me, there was little substance and little to get me ""hooked"".

While I do not deny that there is a market for games like Black and White, I do believe that this market demands more challenging and compelling products.

If you make it past an hour, tasks become tedious, lifeless and dull."
44786,2,like ff8 you either like it or dont. i dont. this game is an embarrassment to the series. this is coming from a long time hardcore final fantasy fan--this game isn't that great.
488492,2,"This game is really bad, looks terrible, boring action, and you've seen absolutely everything within about 5 hours. However, it was an easy platinum so I'll give it an extra star."
104593,2,"So I finally got around to playing and beating Assassin's Creed. I kept putting it off time and again because I had been warned that the game was overrated and extremely repetitive by some friends. To a large extent they were spot-on correct. Had I written a review for Assassin's Creed in the first 2 or 3 hours that I played it I would've given the game 5-stars. Now after beating the game, I'm genuinely glad it's over and feel that at best it's a 2-star game.

First, the plot of AC isn't at all what I was expecting. The game is actually set in the near future not during the Crusades. Although you'll be spending most of your time in the year 1191. Confused? Yep, well the story will start to make more sense as you play along. Suffice to say that a shadowy group in the year 2012 has kidnapped Desmond - your character - and holding him hostage. Desmond is then forced to use a machine called the ""Animus"" to relive memories of his Assassin ancestors that are somehow imprinted on his DNA. It's far fetched but interesting.

Your enter your first memory as Altair - an arrogant and reckless Assassin - on a mission to recover an artifact from the Crusaders. The first mission goes terribly wrong and Altair is to blame. The leader of the Assassins, Al Mualim strips Altair of his rank and prestige and sets Altair about regaining his lost honor. Al Mualim gives Altair the task of killing 9 individuals in order to set things right. With that you're released to explore the world around you and kill your first mark in Damascus.

The world consists of 4 cities - Maysaf, Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre. Maysaf serves as the Assassin's hub and the other 3 cities are where you'll find your marks. Each city consists of 3 zones - Wealthy, Middle Class and Poor districts. At first only one zone in each city is available; as the story progresses more zones open up.

This is where the first problems really creep in. As soon as you arrive in Damascus to find your first mark you'll be locked into a very rigid mission structure. Regardless of how open the game claims to be it is actually the exact opposite. You first arrive outside the city gates, sneak into the city via some scholarly assistance and find yourself again confined to whatever zone you're in. The next task is to find a tower to climb in order to ""sync"" your map. Essentially you climb towers to reveal the locations of important story-related activities.

Each zone has a predetermined amount of towers to climb. That reveals citizens who need assistance from thugs, eavesdropping events, pickpocketing locations and other assassins that either need help or are testing you. At first this seems rather rewarding and somewhat addicting. Saving citizens from thugs garners you support of mobs that you can use to avoid city guards. Eavesdropping on certain conversations grants you a key piece of information about your target. So an and so forth. The objective is to reveal as much of the map as possible, collect pertinent information on your mark and report back to the local Assassin's office to prepare for the assassination.

While this is initially rewarding, the fact that you have to repeat the exact same actions again and again - 9 times total by games end - will leave you groaning in boredom and tediousness. After dutifully climbing each tower, saving each citizen and completing every other tedious task set forth for about 3 marks I'd had enough. You'll quickly realize that most, if not all of the tasks aren't essential to complete the mission. You can completely ignore the citizens in peril, find 3 pickpocketing or eavesdropping events which garner you the required 3 key pieces of information and then simply report to the Assassin's office in whatever city you're visiting. Then it's just a matter of tracking down your mark, killing him and then losing your pursuers. It's really that simple. Though by games end you'll likely be numb from the tedium.

Combat too starts out interestingly enough but soon becomes all to repetitive. Altair gains more abilities and improved weapons as the game goes on. At some point you gain the ability to counter enemy attacks and this is where the game really becomes simple. In essence just tapping a button at the correct moment is all you need in order to defeat every enemy in the game.

The scale and the graphics of Assassin's Creed are clearly the standout. I played through the game a full year after it was released and it is still impressive. The cities are genuinely beautifully rendered, although the luster will most certainly fade once you realize just how similar each city really is.

Assassin's Creed is definitely worth playing. Though I can't honestly recommend anyone purchase the game. Without the useless fetch quests what's left can easily be completed in a few hours. Stick with a rental."
470137,2,too difficult to master
272983,2,"Talk. Talk. Talk. Choose one of four responses. Flounder about with awkward controls. Sit idle for lengthy cut-scenes. Repeat.

I was cheering on the zombies within 20 minutes.

This could be the video game that weans me forever from purchasing another licensed game. The victims here will be fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walking-Dead/dp/B009FZZFME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walking Dead</a>, looking for a fix now that Season 3 is finished and faced with a seven-month gap until Season 4 begins.

The game centers around Lee Everett, a former professor and convicted murderer, and an eight-year old girl named Clementine (I'd describe her plight more but, frankly, it is unoriginal).

Lee is almost unaccountably dumb, a character as shallow as Scooby Doo. The comparisons have merit as early in the first episode Lee inexplicably slips in a pool of blood and clips his head on a kitchen counter, making what should be a mundane exit from a house into a life-and-death struggle with a zombie babysitter.

Yeah, your read that correctly, the protagonist can't handle an undead teenage girl.

Ruh roh.

The shallowness of Lee's character is such that it makes him nearly as soulless as the titular zombies he's fighting. At each moral dilemma, I was presented with four responses from which to choose. These choices can often be categorized as honest, dishonest, abrasive and evasive. This simplistic gameplay evoked memories of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cave-of-Time-Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-1/dp/0553269658/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cave of Time (Choose Your Own Adventure #1)</a>, described by Wikipedia as ""...a series of children's gamebooks where each story is written from a second-person point of view, with the reader assuming the role of the protagonist and making choices that determine the main character's actions and the plot's outcome.""

My attention span waning, I stuck with it for another 20 minutes as Lee met more thick-headed characters (each I quickly rooted against), embracing zombie attacks as a release from the wooden dialogue. After retrieving the disc, I searched out other reviews of this game to see how my experience compared. Clearly, I was more severe than most and much less forgiving of the writing. My patience with the AMC show is also fading, so my lack of enthusiasm for the video game may be a casualty of zombie saturation.

Rating: Two stars."
424690,2,Has no grip. Your thumbs still slip.
205228,2,"The price was right and the description reminded me of Burnout Paradise so I took a chance with this game.  Wrong move.  First off, the characters are horrible and the voice acting is even worse.  I really couldn't stand listening to them and the storyline was stupid.  I couldn't enjoy the game because I spent all my time just driving to a destination and then going through frustrating driving challenges to earn a license.  I know that there is always a learning curve on any game, but I never got to a point where I wanted to go back and play the game.  It was just annoying.  Can not recommend it at all."
315350,2,"I know this is a popular game, and I want to like it so badly! But the gameplay to me, at least on portable, is just annoying as all heck. I tried again and again but I am just not a fan of this game. Maybe it is because I am using the controls of a 3DS but I think the style is just confusing and annoying."
286040,2,"Well, the game is fun. Especially with kids. I'll give it that. However, it fails on several key fronts:

First, there is no reason that this game should have been tied to a toy franchise. The toys merely unlock characters in the game. No significant data is stored on them, and leveling them up does nothing for the characters themselves other than incrementing a numeric value. From a collector's perspective or a child's perspective, it might be nice to have figurines to show off or play with, but from a gamer's perspective, this is an entirely egregious use of resources and a rip-off to boot. They could have made the same game without the portal of power knock-off and the toys that go along with it, charged less money, and focused more resources on improving on the game itself, which is lacking, in the end. The Toy Story 3 game, which this one was clearly based on, was great, affordable, and provided fantastic game-play, both linear and open ended. Disney infinity is a stumble in the a half-right, half-wrong direction.

Second off, the creative toy box mode is extremely limited and totally buggy. You cannot fill your toy box with much before it maxes out and forces you to delete things if you want to add more. You cannot make anything you create in it interactive beyond the built-in interactivity of the objects you place; you can't create missions, or dialog, or set up any sort of logic-triggered events. And it often breaks. Many times have I placed an object and wanted to move it around and found it permanently fixed in space with no way to select it. This is one of several unacceptable glitches in this mode that make it frustrating more than fun, more stifling than freeing.

Finally, co-op presents many missed opportunities. I love couch co-op, I love playing video games with my kid. This one is pretty fun for a little while. Still, forcing you to buy more toys to unlock specific characters in order to even play co-op after you're already spent 70$ on the game is an insult. See, you can't bring characters from different movies into each others' worlds. This right here is a huge missed opportunity for fun. What's more, there is no co-op specific content. There are no vehicles that can carry two people. There are no missions requiring two players, co-operation, or that particularly benefit from being carried out by two people other than you might finish them faster which means you likely have to split up anyways.

Again, it can be fun for kids. Disney Infinity is more creative than its obvious counterpart, Skylanders, provides more interest methods of travel throughout its worlds, and is a fine way to distract or spend an evening with your kid. But it doesn't really live up to its promises, and takes on the excessively wasteful and expensive baggage of real world toys without any clear reason or obvious benefit other than to make more money."
451642,2,"I bought this game off the bargain shelf last week and I am pretty disappointed in it.  Although the reviews mention the game's humor it was not apparant after the game began and for the few hours I played through it.
I did not think the graphics were good even for a 1st generation PS2 game.  The camera is pretty bad and induces motion sickness.  Objectives in the game are not readily apparant.  A lot of the game seems to involve switching to a sniper-scope targeting system.  Unfortunately you can not really move and fire at the same time.
I would instead recommend the bargain title Oni which seems to be sort of in the same style but has much better game play and cool style."
99422,2,"Zack Snyder's big screen adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 was a smash hit, so naturally a video game adaptation seemed inevitable.  300: March to Glory follows Spartan king Leonidas and his small army of Spartan warriors as they take on the invading Persian army.  While 300 features some great sound effects, music, blood effects, and overall style; it's ultimately empty in the gameplay department.  At it's core, 300 is a generic hack & slasher/clumsy beat 'em up featuring a horde of recurring enemies and moments where you'll attain some special abilities to spice things up.  The graphics are stiff, jerky, and don't really do a whole lot to push the power of the PSP, while the voice work featured throughout (even though David Wenham is the only cast member from the film to be featured in the game) is excellent as well.  The jerky camera, stiff animation, and the unimaginitive and lame combat system are what really hurts 300 as a whole though, which is sad because the game could have been something pretty good had more time been put into it's development.  That being said, if you're a fan of the 300 film or graphic novel, or you just want to play a quick hack & slash on the go for your PSP, 300: March to Glory is worth checking out, but in the end though, it's better left on the shelf."
395197,2,couldn't  do a complete install to see if the game works and then got charged on restocking fee and other fee's wound up with $1.25 send to my bank could have sold it on craigs list for more and no fee's.
162074,2,"Buy Titan Quest and install the Diablo II Immortal MOD, below is how to accomplish this.
Hear ye, hear ye, this is Diablo II with a graphics update or Diablo III as it should have been...maybe. The point is, if you loved Diablo II and you just want better graphics, then just play this game with the Diablo II character classes. Let me tell to what to do and don't worry it is completely legal so don't worry. Unlike Blizzard's games where any modification will land you in the pen this game encourages modding and has some great ones. The one you'll care the most about though, like me, is called Diablo 2 Immortal. Go to titanquest(dot)net a very friendly very legal website and look under their modding tab and find the D2 Immortal mod and download it. It should be fairly simple to install, but should you run into any issues leave me a note and I'll gladly help you out. Believe me, I want people to find this and enjoy it like I have. I had been dying to play my Skeleton raising Necromancer and my Hammerdin from Dibalo 2 but I lost my D2 expansion disk and didn't want to drop $20 again on D2 and plus I'm furious at Blizzard for the abomination that they released and insultingly called it Diablo III. Seriously, all you need is this game and the Diablo 2 Immortal Mod and you are set for a good long while. While on titanquest(dot)net log in and drop them a huge thank you, lots of work goes into what they do."

105176,2,"This game is a mess (though it was made many moons ago).  The graphics are okay (but you can't see a lot of the smaller enemies), the weapon system is good, the scale of battles is good, however...everything is poorly implemented especially the control scheme.

Control is too touchy, battles are too hectic and too fixed (objective-wise), story is goofy, and the game is extremely repetitive.  Even with a six pack in front of you you're going to be bored out of your skull.  It is a very cheap game at retail, though in this case you're going to get what you pay for."
453603,2,"It's almost painful to see a game with this much potential fail so miserably.  The premise is superb - a lone mage fighting hordes of enemies with a wide variety of spells.  Unfortunately, the controls and gameplay kill this promising concept.  Switching between the different spells that you need is cumbersome, and you can only save in designated spots.  The graphics are probably the only redeeming features, as the spell effects are impressive and it is interesting to watch Arran age over the course of the game from a young boy into an old, wise wizard.
Overall I can only recommend this game if you are a serious fan of spellcasting-based games and if you can get a cheap purchase/rental price."
142795,2,"I got this game about a month ago, and have played it only once or twice. If any of you have played this in the arcade, it's the exact same game. I would only rent this game if I could go back and not purchase it. It's a direct port from the arcade. I paid about 32 bucks for it, and my friend and I nearly beat HOTD2 in about 15 minutes. I'm not kidding. You could probably easily beat both games in about 2 or 3 hours. RENT THIS GAME! It is not worth your money to buy it! Take my advice!"

When I took it out of my computer today the metal piece holding the USB connector came right off along with the connectors. I've submitted return to amazon to swap for another one, but am disappointing to say the least that I'm having to swap it out after 1 use."
49514,2,"Allow me to preface this by giving kudos to the programmer who put all his energy into designing a game that came solely from his heart.  That alone is worth an added star.

That being said...

If you believe in the supernatural, then this game is for you.

If you like your supernature to be eerie, then this game is for you.

If you enjoy adventure games in which you interact with no one, then this game is for you.

If you like taking lots of notes, as well as hand-drawing cryptic designs, then this game is for you.

If you like open-ended unanswered questions at the conclusion, then this game is for you.

This game was not for me.

Don't get me wrong, those who appreciate a creepy atmosphere and worthy (albeit grainy) graphics will be quite satisfied. ...if that's all they want.  But I wanted and expected more than that, and this game left me thoroughly frustrated to have spent all that time suspending disbelief only to be disappointed overall.

I'm sorry, but for me, the cons heavily outweighed the pros.  I wish they didn't."
421494,2,"This adds some content to the base game including new areas and quests. But it's mainly fluff. Go to a wedding and try to woo your date, talk to nefarious people and find out why they're so bitter, go though an old manor and arrange items so the game will progress. Way too much dialog. I found myself pushing the skip button dozens of times before I even got to a dialog decision and that was usually trivial. The base game is much better.

Be advised, if the PlayStation network is down you can not even launch the base game anymore. I was at the final boss battle of the base game and PSN went down. I downloaded this DLC, but wasn't even playing anything from it yet. After over 100 hours of play the only option offered was to start a new game. DRM has gotten way out of hand. The game is fantastic, but this DLC puts you at the mercy of PSN and that's not a good position to be in."
102544,2,"I follow NASCAR and look forward to the release of the NASCAR game every year.  In previous years I have enjoyed the career mode where you start in the Whelan series and work your way up to the Nextel series.  I thought with the PS3 version, there would be lots of extras and career modes.  However, the career options are very limited and have not held my attention.  Also, in trying to allow you to set up the cars for racing, they have made it impossible to control the cars even in easy modes.  It is impossible to get through a race without causing a yellow flag (the yellow flag is thrown so quick, sometimes you don't even see the wreck).  I think this game will be a trade-in at Gamestop for Dirt which has a great demo on the PS3."
46481,2,"Having never played the card game, I bought this primarily because it was X-box live capable and at $30 was a pretty good deal.
In single mode you begin with a cahracter (you have no choice who you start with) and then begin a series of battles.  Each time you win you are rewarded with a new spell.  Each of these quests consists of about 15 - 20 battles until you get to the ""boss"" battle.  Defeating this boss gets you one of 5 colored gem on the way to completing the entire quest.
As has been noted by other reviewers, the battles tend to be either so easy that you beat them on the first try, or so frustrating that you give up after hours of trying.  When games are this tough it's always a signal to me that the game play is so thin that they make it very hard in an attempt to make things seem deeper.
But the more you play the quest and arcade modes, the more spells and characters you can get in order to fight on-line.  You can pick your skill lever and your cards and battle it out against friends or foe from around the country.
Frankly I'm a bit disappointed in that it seems there are not many online players for this game.  I find it surprising given the popularity of the game, but as I said, the game is not very in depth with only some 70 or so odd spells and I think experienced Magic players may be turned off by this.
Also, thus far there has been ZERO new content to download while a game like Rainbow Six 3 has provided 5 new maps already.
It's not a horrible game but I have to guess it's just not deep enough for experience Magic fans and just not fun enough for new players."
104569,2,"The first 2-3 hours of gameplay are great, jumping from building to building, riding a horse through open fields, hiding from soldiers, etc.  Then you realize the major flaw of the game: repetition. You do the exact same thing city after city after city, which gets old really quick.  It actually becomes very tedious towards the end, making it feel more like a chore then a game.  I'm guessing most high reviews for this game were written by people after only a few hours of playing...I doubt they would leave the same reviews now.  Its obvious this title was rushed because it was a launch title for the PS3.  The developers spent more time on the visuals then they did the actual content of the game.  I recommend renting this game for a week, not buying it."

I gave up trying to get this to work because I didn't want to undo all the work I did to make my X-one controller to work in the first place.

240314,2,"I have been looking forward to this game for quite some time. I have been watching clips on the making of the game every chance I get. Now that I have the movie, notice I did say movie, I regret spending the money. The Last of Us was a great game. A 5 star masterpiece for the PS3. That game told a great story, had great graphics, and outstanding gameplay. Between Two Souls has a decent story but to me it lacked so much in game play that it became boring quickly. Both games directed the player to the end result but the Last of Us was not so noticeable. The decision to feed the player bits and pieces of Jodie's past out of order did not add to the story in any way. It only served to further frustrate me. I could not wait for it to be over and learn the truth. As for your choices changing the game's outcome, I think the only one to do that is at the end. Without spoiling it, I am sure you will see what I am referring to. I will be short here in the details, but if you are thinking about buying this game and have played and enjoyed Heavy Rain, then by all means buy it. If you have not played Heavy Rain, then I suggest watching a few clips on You Tube or even renting it from Red Box first. The story is not that long and can be played in a day. In my honest opinion this is not a PS3 masterpiece and not worth 5 stars. I am sure many disagree, but then everyone is entitled to their opinion. Think of the games you really enjoyed and compare Beyond Two Souls to them and then judge for yourself."
106513,2,"NBA Live has always come in second place to NBA 2K games, atleast to me. Live has always had excellent ideas, but the game has always suffered from sloppy gameplay with little details to the small things that make up a basketball game. Once again, some great ideas carried through with bad gameplay.

There is one aspect I need to discuss first. Passing is TERRIBLE. I know they want to make passing more realistic, but I had Garnett posting up on a defender, right in front of the active players face, and I pressed to pass, and Rondo BOUNCED the ball on the ground hard and it made Garnett jump for it. I mean, honestly, is there a point in that? And sometimes, when I turn on the passing icons, I'll press square or whatever other button I want to pass it to, and my player won't even pass. Sometimes, my player will just throw the ball away when I pass. It's very nervewracking.

Also, foul calling is about stupid. If you run over a defender when you're on offense, it's an automatic offensive charge. Now if the situation is switched, and you're defending, don't hold your breathe on getting a charge. Even when you press the button for a charge, and your player goes in motion, you'll get ran over, but no foul will be called. Half the time, when I get called for a reach in, I didn't even see my player's hand move towards the ball. Half the time, I don't even go for a steal.

Through games, I can't shake the feeling that I'm playing in an arcade. It just feels so fake. The graphics are fine, when I'm the Celtics, I can tell who's Ray Allen, who's Pierce, and who's Garnett, but the feeling of simulation is too strong. When you go for a rebound, the player may not even be that close to the ball, but somehow it lands in his hands. Laying-up is a bit more animated but also looks fake. How can AI lay it up over Garnett and Oden?

Despite the poor gameplay, there are redeeming extras and a deep Franchise mode. In Franchise Mode, you get to go through the NBA Draft (I landed Oden for the Celtics) and hire a coaching staff. They incorporated a new rumor central, that's kinda like a news feed but not exactly news yet. You can read and research all the speculation of signings, trades, releases, and others. You can have your assistant work on players to make them better, and have him set up practices, events, and days off to help fatigue and team chemistry. You can check what players have to say about the team to know what changes are to be made. It's the best kind of Franchise I've ever played, honestly.

There are other extras like the All-Star Weekend and Fiba World Championship. The All-Star weekend is fun, where you can play the rookie challenge, the 3-point shoot-out, the all-star game, or the celebrated Slam Dunk contest. I have to admit, the Slam Dunk contest is hard but fun. You can go to the Slam-Dunk School, but it really doesn't help you with your dunk any. The Fiba World Championship brings other countries' basketball teams in to the picture, who you can also play with in exhibition games.

Overall, the Franchise Mode and the All-Star weekend dominate this game. For me, though, I'd rather have more realistic in-game play than added features. If an NBA game added the graphics and gameplay of NBA 2K, and the Franchise Mode of Live, I would never put my controller down. But since that isn't gonna happen soon, I think I'd rather stick with NBA 2K. But if a deep Franchise mode is what you want, then go for this one. For now, I'll pass."
109953,2,"I absolutely love first person shooter games.  I've been an avid fan of them since the early days of Doom.  And I usually play them all.

I was excited when this game came out, it sounded really interesting because of the Co-op.  Well, save your money.

While the graphics are not too bad, and the storyline is at least average if not better, the controls are absolutely horrible.  In my opinion the thing that makes or breaks a FPS is the ability to control your character's movement *intuitively*.  Having to snap back to back to keep a circle cleared may work really well in real life, but it is so confusing in a game that I literally sold the game after playing it for 2 hours.  I tried really hard to get into the controller and get used to it, and I'm a pretty patient person, but try as I did, I just couldn't get good at the controls.

My advice is to rent this game first!  Try it out, see if you are okay with the control layout BEFORE you invest your money.

I hope this was helpful."
327740,2,I did not find this game very fun it was hard to get past the graphics and unfinished feel. There was potential but nothing special stood out about the story or game play that made me want to complete it. Even though I did finished the game I couldn't force myself to try the DLC's  I guess it was just not what expected so I could not get into it.
212809,2,"""Hey it's another soul calibur what could go wrong!?!""  Plenty...and it did go wrong.  I'm only commenting on the single player portion of the game because I don't play online (as if the online component could be any better in this particular game...).

The single person component is very short, incredibly boring, and a lot of the characters feel pretty much the same.  In the story mode (if you can call it that) you're stuck with petroklos who is a male version of sophitia (pretty much) with some different moves; you can play as a couple other characters (zwei, pyrra, and deviations of pyrra and petroklos) in that mode within the story but petroklos is who you're stuck with.  If you can't stand the character you'll be scratching your eyes out in 5-10 minutes.  The arcade mode is short and the ai cheap as heck, and the creation mode is somewhat more lame than what it used to be.

I was lucky, I just rented this game and actually rented it for free but...I would definitely want my gas money back on this dog.  Awful awful awful awful.  I might just go to namco headquarters and ask for my gas money back.  Awful awful awful awful...did I mention it is awful.  Oh and most of the ""new"" characters are either clones or completely lame; zwei is okay...if this were a final fantasy game; magic werewolf(?), must've been playing operation darkness."
266170,2,"I hooked up the Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS2 to a Turtle Beach Ear Force X32 and I was sourly disappointed. I didn't notice any ""real"" Surround Sound difference. After playing with many presets and ""Surround Sound Angles"" I just couldn't get a good sound I liked that was true Surround Sound, it felt far more 3D than anything.

After looking extensively online, I noticed the Turtle Beach removed the  5.1/7.1 from the DSS2 packaging from the previous DSS which I found odd. The price was also lowered, which I found odd for an ""improved model"".

After a week I decided to return the product as I felt it wasn't good enough to justify the additional cost."
154901,2,"I bought this game at the same time I bought Wii Play. I only paid $10 for this game and $20 for Wii Play. No one in the family has played Wii Play for more than a few minutes. Both kids and adults say its very boring. Wii Play on the other hand is worth every penny. So if you want a fun family go, then go with Wii Play."
455519,2,"X-Men: Next Dimension is a somewhat enjoyable game.  Any X-Men fan will be happy to play as over 24 different characters ripped straight from the comics, with powers intact.
All characters have multiple outfits and are highly detailed.  The graphics overall in the game aren't outstanding, but they're decent enough.  The special effects on the powers are the icing on the cake, standing out above everythign else in the game.  The environment is interactive and players can be thrown through floors, cielings, windows and walls to new areas of the level.
That's about it for the great features though.  Probably the most troubling aspect about this game is the fact that it has virtually NO SOUND EFFECTS whatsoever while you fight.  You spend most of the time watching you characters throw punches and kicks at one another with only the music going, and occasionally you might hear a punch connect or a character groan in pain.  Otherwise there is complete silence while you fight.  I'm not sure how that slipped past the Quality Assurance testers unless they were all deaf.  I thought it was just the XBox, since just about every XBox game seems to be plagued with sound problems, but it wasn't.  The game just lacks sound effects.
Another troubling aspect is the difficulty...now i'm not one for easy games, in fact I hate games that are so easy you can blow through them in a 30 minutes sitting...but Next Dimension transcends the boundaries of high difficulty.  I haven't played a fighting game this hard in a long, long time.  And while a challenge is certainly welcome, there is a definite difference between challenge and insanity.  The difficulty in this game, unfortunately, falls into the insanity category.  While you probably won't have to cheat your way to victory, the only way to assure that you win is to spend HOURS in the practice mode with every character.  Since you are forced to play as different characters as the game progresses in Story Mode, you must know how to use each character.  And even then...the game can become so frustrating at times that its best that you turn it off and put it on the shelf for a few days.  It can be fun at times, but most of the time succeeds at being terribly difficult.
The control is pretty bad...and the clunky junk that is the XBox controller does not help matters.  Special moves are straightforward but difficult to perform because of the responsiveness of the controls.  If you have a special kind of gamepad from a third party developer, use that instead.  They typically have better D-pads.
Overall, the game just seems rushed, or incomplete.  The lack of sound effects, the crazy difficulty and the lack of options and bad control just harm the game's fun factor.  There is plenty to unlock, and there is a decent story tagged along on the game, but in the end this game is mediocre in every sense of the word.  It will only appeal to die-hard X-Men fans, such as myself.  If you are interested in the game, give it a rent.  You might like it...its not a horrible game, it just could've been alot better."
318889,2,"I got Battlefield 4 when it was released. Yes, I already know that's what happens when you buy a game when it is first released but for it to be this bad? They should have just delayed Battlefield 4. It is actually a great game but because it has so many problems, it's terrible. When this game is working, it is the best FPS I have ever played but 1 out of 10 times just doesn't cut it. This game has a lot of problems.

If you like to accurately shoot players for 4 seconds, close up, when you are not suppressed and that player is being suppressed and getting hit from your teammates, and he turns to you, shoots you with the same exact weapon you have, kills you with 3 bullets when it took you 27, then this is the game for you. That is exactly what happened to me. In fact, I have shot other players in the head from point blank range well before they shot me but for some reason, I still get killed. No it's not my internet and it's not me. This game is that bad. I can tell if I'm getting killed because of my mistakes or because of this crappy game and the majority of the time, it is because of this game. What is the point of playing it if you can't even kill anyone? And the bullets follow you around corners as well. I would get behind cover well before the other player was able to kill me and still get killed.

I've tried playing single player. I do not play it much and one of the reasons is because I've read from others that your save file gets deleted. In fact this happened to a friend of mine. Whenever I did try to play it, I would get kicked out. Paused it, left my room for a while, came back and got kicked out of the game. Next time, playing it and all of a sudden the application closed on me... again.

When the game first released, I was being kicked completely out of the game more times than I was actually playing it. It was so bad that even after you press the Options button to go to the main menu, the app would close. There were other problems as well but that one was the biggest one (for me anyways). They patched it and... I was not being kicked from the game anymore. I still get kicked out at times but it is way better than before. It does not happen much. I am patiently waiting for the patches. Despite its problems, I went ahead and bought premium anyways because I knew I was going to be playing this game for a while and that's still true. I continue play it.

I would not really recommend this game AT THIS TIME. When it gets better, I will change the score and update the review but right now it is bad. I do like it playing it but because the game is unplayable the majority of the time, I don't really play it much. Sometimes I can't stand it because it's so bad. Buy at your own risk. If you can deal with the problems, go ahead. Again, the game is actually great but its problems make it bad. I would rate it a 5 out of 5 if this stuff didn't happen so much.

UPDATE: 10/25/14

They have released a few patches since I wrote my review. There have been some good changes but not enough to make me recommend this game. It's still bad. I have good internet and everything yet I still have problems. The last update seemed to produce even more problems with the game such as movement (getting stuck in doorways, grass, etc.). Like I have stated when I first wrote this review, if you really want this game and can deal with its problems, go ahead and get it. However, I recommend getting it at a low price. Coming to think of it, it's best to rent it if you really want to play the game. With the game in its current state, I wouldn't really recommend spending an extra $50 for premium. And for those that will say that it's me and/or it's my internet, try to remember that just because your copy works doesn't mean that everyone elses does."

83089,2,"I was looking for a good ""racing"" game for the Wii.  All over the web it seems that this one is most highly praised.  This review is for someone looking for a racing game where the vehicles behave even somewhat realistically.  The cover of the box reminded me of 4X4EVO and 4X4EVO2 which are games I played on a PC with steering wheel control about 7 years ago.  I really like those games and was hoping this was similar.
This game does allow you to race.....that is true.  It can also be a lot of fun.  The problem is this.  I can't begin to tell you WHAT you are racing.  Maybe if we called it a hovercraft or a jet truck or a spaceship/truck hybrid, it might help.  Any resemblance to the way a real truck, or any real world vehicle for that matter, behaves seems to be out of the question with this game.  The graphics are good and scenery is very realistic.  That is when you can see it.  The trucks move at an impossible pace.  They have turbo boost and when you play against the computer trucks, you will find that if you do not use your turbo boost to the maximum, you will not keep up.  This causes the truck to move at relative speed of what seems to be 150 miles an hour through what is usually woods.  Almost nothing stops the truck as far as terrain or turns in the road.  Trees will stop you.  Trees will ALWAYS stop you.  Any tree you hit will make the truck crash and cause you to wait until you can resume.  Now, on to the flying part.  If you really compete with the computer trucks, you spend anywhere from 30% to 50% of the time in the air.  You can control staying in the air longer or shorter (HHMMMMM what is the physics of that?).  You can STEER in the air???!!!!!  You can land after being 50 yards in the air and just keep on going as though that would not cause any damage, but don't hit that tree....you will stop dead in your tracks.
This is definitely a very fun ""jet car/truck flying amphibious hovercraft spaceship"" racing game.  No realism to speak of."
394322,2,We bought this game as we have always loved Guitar Hero...well up to now. The graphics were somewhat better and playing in front of a crowd was a great change but those were just surface candy. The problems lay within the game itself. The number of songs is fairly limited (of course you can always buy more since the devs are greedy for not including them in the base game) and the guitar has some serious issues that need to be worked out. My word of advice is get this game...but wait a few more months.
131769,2,"I played two games on this and haven't played since because I thought the whole thing was not very good. It is just some mini games that really, in my opinion, aren't worth buying. They are supposed to teach you all there is to know about using the controller to play Wii, but honestly, you can learn all that from other games (like the included Sports games) like I did. Pointless really. I was disappointed.
I bought this with a ""bonus"" controller, so at least the game itself was only about $10."
374384,2,"An aggressively stupid shooter.

The addition of ""double jump"".  Can't save this franchise.  Titanfall did the whole movement system better 6 months ago.  Hell, Quake III did it better nearly a decade ago."
227692,2,"Fit in Six is Ubisoft's latest entry into the world of fitness games on the Wii. In many ways, it is the metaphysical heir to the original ""My Fitness Coach"" which helped pioneer the genre three years ago. Like that game, this one includes a large number of cardio and aerobic exercises. And like that game, this one doesn't use the Wii motion controls at all. You are ""on the honor system"" as to whether you're doing the exercises right (or at all).

The number of workouts you can choose from is almost staggering. You can choose from ""classes"" that have 10-15 minute workouts focusing on upper body, core body, general fitness, cardio, boot camp, kick boxing, cardio dance, pilates, latin dance, and dance moves. The workouts are all very good, professionally designed exercises that teach you good technique and posture. As others have written, your on-screen trainer is cartoony to say the least, but that's to be expected with the Wii.

One thing I wasn't too crazy about was how quickly the on-screen trainers move, without breaking down their moves or otherwise giving you a chance to learn them. This is especially frustrating on some of the quick ""dance step"" routines. But with enough repetition, you'll eventually get them.

The lack of motion controls was a deal buster for me. Granted, many people enjoy workout titles without the motion controls, but to me, if I'm going to work out like that I'd rather just pop in a DVD and watch a real human instead of watching a cartoony character I can't interact with. At the very least I would have liked to see them build-in the option for motion detection, with the ability to shut them off. But it seems that after debacles like Your Shape with Jenny McCarthy, Ubisoft seems to have thrown in the towel completely in terms of trying to get motion detection correct. Worse, the fact that this game supports a USB camera may lead some to believe that it has Kinect-like motion controls; of course, it doesn't--all connecting the camera does is show a postage stamp-sized video image of you in the corner, not even aligned with the on-screen trainer so you can't compare your steps to his or hers.

Overall, I'd say if you liked the original My Fitness Coach, you'll probably like this. It's a worthy successor to it in that it provides a much wider selection of exercises and doesn't let poor motion controls (or any motion controls) get in the way of your workout. A few years ago, I might have given this 5 stars, but in 2011, it's just ""ok"", especially when compared to other similar games on the Xbox and Playstation, or even other games like EA Sports Active on the Wii which do advanced things like good motion detection and heart rate monitoring."
45111,2,"Here's the basic run-down:  What you have here is a first-person shooter, made with the Unreal engine.  It was based on a Belgian comic book, and imitating the style of said book, it uses a nifty graphic effect called ""cel-shading"" which makes the polygonal characters look less like the realistic figures many games aim for and more like cartoon or comic-book characters.  Game play is divided between straightforward action sequences and goal-based sequences, usually involving stealth.

So far so good. But...

As a gamer, I always take things with a grain of salt when a reviewer says a game is too hard.  For many gamers, the response that comes to mind is invariably ""Maybe it was too hard for YOU...""  But listen.  I can play through most games on their ""regular"" difficulty setting, and this one I gave up on, largely because of the aforementioned ""stealth"" sections.

There are stealth games, and games with stealth segments, that I enjoyed.  Metal Gear Solid and Deus Ex both come to mind. But a stealth game really ought to have some, if not all, of the following features: 1) Being spotted by an enemy makes things difficult, but does not automatically kill the player.  2) Stealth gameplay should allow players a great deal of flexibility in routes to take and tactics to use; it should never be ""read the designers' minds or die.""  3) Stealth games should have a system for saving your game that doesn't mean you have to sneak past the same four guards over and over again because you keep getting spotted by the fifth.

Guess what game fails on all three counts?

*ding* *ding* *ding*!  That's right, unlucky number XIII.  Many of the stealth sections are _exactly_ matters of memorizing the guards positions (after innumerable failures), then timing your movements with theirs, or failing.  Want to kill one of those obnoxious, alarm- raising guards?  Oops!  Pity the patrol path of another guard (who you never saw) takes him within line of sight of the body.  You can move bodies, IF you're using a weapon that leaves one or both hands free, a fact the manual fails to mention.  The main character also has a kind of ""sixth sense"" which allows him to see visible, comic-like ""tap tap taps"" on screen when an unseen enemy is walking nearby, but it's only intermitently useful.  Expect to still be blindsided with annoying frequency.

Compounding all this frustration is a save-game system that is dead lousy, even for a console port.  Expect to be able to save at the beginning of a level, and that's it.  If you're lucky, the designers may have deigned to give a checkpoint or two, frequently at points that make little sense (not immediately before a ""boss battle"", but three bad guys before it?)  The combination of these two points is unforgivable.  I gave up on this game on a stealth-based submarine level featuring guards walking overhead on catwalks.  These catwalks made guards who could see me nearly impossible to spot myself and literally impossible to kill before they triggered an alarm.  Thanks, guys, I love games that make my small advances in progress meaningless in such an arbitrary fashion.

Irritating but less game-killing annoyances:  The game's characters lip-sync their speech in a fashion barely better than the old Speed Racer cartoons.  For a game with such fluid animation otherwise, and given any number of recent games with very good in-engine character lipsync, this is incomprehensible.  Lead actor David Duchovny's inflection seems utterly uninterested in the intrigues around him (phoned in another paycheck, eh, Dave?)  And for a game that clearly prides itself on its storyline, there are weaknesses in pacing and moments that completely jar one's suspension of disbelief.  A ""rescue mission"" level ends if a guard trips an alarm while you're outside the prison, but this condition vanishes when you enter the prison itself.  (There's no alarms IN the prison?)  Some levels link one into another in a frustratingly endless fashion; other times, after a single level it's time for a cutscene, restored health, and a new weapons loadout.  The latter is both bewildering and annoying: Why does the protaganist, knowing he's heading into the lion's den, choose to leave some of his most powerful weapons behind?... Because he knows what kind of ammo the bad guys are going to be dropping when he kills them, I guess... The five missiles and the launcher you had at the end of one level are arbitrarily taken away from you, and then you discover you really _should_ have been conserving crossbow bolts during an unnanounced six-level stretch.  A side effect of the process is never knowing whether you should be conserving ammunition or not.  Don't expect the ammunition you need to be conveniently there when you need it; you'll find a ridiculous overabundance of ammunition in some places (throwing knives in the first aid station?  Of course!  Why not?...)  and a fatal dearth of same when you really do need it, like the aforementioned sub stealth mission.

Two last quibbles:  Despite doing a ""full install"", my version demands each of the four CDs be inserted sequentially as you progress through the game.  I also get barraged with unskippable logo sequences for Ubisoft, Nvidia, and Alienware EVERY SINGLE TIME I play.  (Ironic given I've been playing on a Radeon-equipped E-machine.)

To be fair: the graphics are frequently beautiful, the plot probably makes a pretty good graphic novel (if not the best game), the use of a grappling hook is interesting (though not unique), the ability to pick up some ordinary objects to use as blunt weapons is a nice touch, and the musical score isn't half bad.  Still, there are many better games on which to spend your time, even in the bargain bin, including first-person shooters.  Why frustrate yourself with ones like this?"
387701,2,"I'll start with the good, the unit is compact, setup is a breeze and is great for partys. My unit worked fine until about 3 days ago when the controller ports messed up. I didn't drop it or tug the cords or anything but no matter how I configure the controllers in dolphin port number 4 controls player one, port 3 controlls player 4
Port 2 does player 3 and so on. Please help"

76504,2,"Despite what others may have said, this is a stripped down version of Rebellion. The verity of ground and space units are very limited to what it's potential could have been. There are only forty some planets to control compared with the more then a dozen solar systems (10 planets in each) that Rebellion possessed. But the most disappointing thing is the AI. In ground combat mode the AI will just come and attack you with minimal effort to draw them out. All you have to do is hold your position and wear them down. Space combat is a little better but still too easy. I recently managed to fend off an attack on a space station with more then 6 dozen enemy capital ships and over 100 fighters and managed to lose a meager 8 capital ships. The only good thing about this game is the cinematic camera mode during space combat. Lucas Arts needs to release more patches to fix the unaddressed bugs that still plague the game. EAW needs heavy modding before it can be a game that can hold your attention for more then 20 hours of playability. A good attempt. But the producers defiantly dropped the ball on this one."
235007,2,"I cannot give this game anything over a 3 star because Black ops was waaaay better and the fact that Battlefield 3 is a way better better online game to play. Nothing can beat Battlefield 3, unless your a total fan boy and blind for this game. Phfft :P"
155692,2,"I am not a big Aerosmith fan but I am not against them either. I have all the guitar hero games up to this one minus the rocks the 80's game.

If you are into Aerosmith you will like this more than likely. I just don't enjoy the list of songs to be honest, besides the fact that most of them are by one band- they are not their best songs in my opinion. There are some other bands songs on here too but I don't like them much either, Susposedly some songs Aerosmith picked.

I like to be completely fair and I don't think this is a good idea to make the games based on any one bands music. Maybe a better idea would be to make genre based GH games, Such as classic rock, newer rock, southern and so on or go by decades and release sequels in volumes like music collections do.
 Many long time guitar hero fans like myself will no doubt be dissapointed that they will have to wait until a game that has some music they like on it comes out. That was one of the main strengths I found in the previous games- that most anyone could find a song they liked or knew at the least.

Aside from my complaints it is a good playing game.

I don't like it much but that is my opinion.

You might like it if aerosmith is popular with you or you don't mind the lack of diversity in the game's band and song list.

I'm sure some people think I am crazy but I have been playing games a long time. Usually after three games in a series they have to go and make some wierd decision like this and upset the way people have got used to something being. It will gain and lose fans of the series.

A big gamble on the developers part I feel but no doubt fueled by their greed and the desire to pump out many more GH games just to make better sales numbers using the rock star image to sell instead of good gameplay. Sadly they will probablly succeed.

Gladly I have been playing this at a friend's house and will not waste my money on it.

I just think looking at the top 40 lists from the past 50 years would be a good guide to follow for future game song tracks."
34163,2,"I like the idea of a video game based on the movie ""The Thing"" by John Carpenter, and I was excited to see how they would play on the fear the players had toward eachother- ""Is he the Thing? Is She??""  As it turned out the game play was extremely slow moving, and at first the controls and interface were difficult master.  The graphics are a bit dated, and if you walk close to wall, you may get a piece of the other room on screen.  In addition, it really didn't follow the movie at all.  It seemed closer to a sci fi shooter like Cold Fear or Extermination, rather than the mind games I assumed it would contain."
203172,2,"Not very intuitive, tired of the repetition used in the tutorial. Kids played it once or twice - now it's living on the shelf."

66876,2,"The idea behind this game is great, the problem is the eyetoy camera is simply not ready for the concept.  Even if you have ideal lighting and space in the room w/ your PS2, there will be many times that your score is affected by the camera not registering hits.  Some game modes work fairly well but some, like the aerobics section, fail miserably.  I can't tell you how irritating it is when you're punching an orb ten times and it won't register a hit and the lighting in the room is perfect and there's no furniture in the background.  Hopefully they'll come out w/ a better eyetoy camera if they make future versions of this game.  It's simply too frustrating to stick w/ any kind of exercise program on here and I lost interest after a week."
46666,2,"I just started playing this game today and just finish the first mission, which took me about an hour to complete both the main and side missions. I did not bother checking out the multiplayer because I heard that there's no servers and if you do get into one, bunch of people get disconnected. Anyway, here's what I don't like and what I like:

I like the main menu music. I like the graphics in this one compare to OFP. I like the combat sounds too. Picking the weapon you want is easier than OFP by pushing the numbers above your QWERTY keys. AI's are much smarter, making the game more realistic. They will try to outflank you. They will take cover behind trees, rocks, and buildings. Oh yeah, you can swim in this game. In the first OFP, you drown in the water. That's about it.

Now here's what I don't like:
1) Its more complicated to control your squad. Have to cycle through bunch of menus to get the right command I want.
2) As mention with other reviews, no free look when driving. I can't look to my right or left or behind me.
3) No tutorial or training missions. If you are brand new to the game, don't you want to learn how to fight and move and all the other goodies before going to combat?
4) Default key assignments are ridiculous. Push F1 to use binocular? Then you have to hold the right mouse button to use it. I don't think you can even zoom with it. I pushed every button on my keyboard to see if I can zoom, but nope.
5) No ability to lean left or right, which is huge deal when peaking or shooting around corners.
6) If you get into a vehicle first, your squad may sometime go in with you without you having to give them an order. I'm like, ""did i order you to get in my vehicle?""
7) You are stuck with the weapon you have before starting the mission! I like the option of choosing different weapons before starting the mission, but apparently it won't let you.
8) When changing weapon, it takes forever for your guy to get that weapon out, especially when you take your rocket launcher out. If you need to get your rifle back out after switching, forget about it. Your dumb guy wants to put a rocket into the launcher first before getting to your other weapon.
9) It is always a 4 man team. Unlike the first OFP where you can control as many as 12 men. However, you are always the team leader from the very first mission.
10) Low lack of vehicles to get into. You are mostly running all over the place.
11) Mission editor sucks b/c there's no preview for it.

I think the main thing the frustrates me the most is giving commands to your squad. This is truly a waste of my $37! Why there's no CD-key? I bought this game b/c I thought I will need a CD-key to play online. APPARENTLY NOT! I bet this game is already free for download on file-sharing programs and you can play online without any CD-key check. Of course, the multiplayer is currently in disarray and they are currently making a patch for this game.

I don't know if future patches to this game will make gaming experience better. They tend to make it better, but I still don't want to cycle through bunch of menus to give orders to my squad. I remember installing patches one by one for OFP and that took forever. You have to install the very first patch to install the most recent patch. You probably will have to do that too for this game as well.

In summary, don't buy this game. Its very disappointing and it doesn't even come close to Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis or OFP Resistance. If they implement the old OFP features with the awesome graphics and sounds, this game would of been the best Operation Flashpoint ever to be made."
62120,2,I looked everywhere for this game. I've even seen it advertised in the newspaper and the games no where to be found. Why?? I can order it online but why don't the stores carry this game??
214651,2,"Dull graphics, unengaging story, and all around childish, it's obvious SquareEnix once again slapped the Final Fantasy badge on a lackluster game."
126081,2,"I bought Bionic Commando with the knowledge that it was not the best game. I had heard that some people had fun with it, and that maybe the critics had been too harsh. I can safely say that this game earns every harsh word that comes its way. Not because it is a flat out bad game, but because what should have been a truly fun game seems to go out of its way to be the exact opposite.

First the good points.
1. The graphics are down right beautiful.
2. Using your Bionic arm is super fun once you get the hang of it.
3. It is fun to swing.

Wow. That was short. Now for the bad.
1. Those beautiful graphics that I mentioned only show ugly, delapidated buildings.
2. Your arm is limited throughout the first part of the game. You are shown how to do everything at the beginning of the game, but for reasons that are never explained, you aren't allowed to use your attacks until your never present commander reminds you how they work. Suck.
3. While swinging is fun, you are only allowed to swing in certain places. Even though the levels look huge, most of them are covered in nearly invisible radiation that kills you almost instantly. You won't know where these places are until you swing right into them and die. Super Suck.
4. The achivements are time consuming given how sporadicly the enemies are sprinkled throughout the levels, so you have two options. Try and have fun, or get the achievements. There is no in between.
5. Water is another near instant kill. Good luck finding something to latch on to in the 2 seconds you're given before you drown.
6. The snipers in this game can hit you from anywhere in the level. Tres unfair.

It seems like the developers of this game made two different versions. the first is a game with huge levels that you can use your super cool arm to zip around in while killing your enemies with style. the second game was put over the first one, and its only purpose it to limit how much fun you can have at any one time. Having fun swinging? Here take some invisible radiation that you can't avoid. You like the bionic arms combat functions? Well then, for the enemies that the style of combat would be affective against were not going to let you use any of the cool moves. When can you use them? When the snipers who can see from anywhere come into play and your melee options become pretty much zero seems like a good idea to us.

In short as well made as this game is, it goes out of its way to kill any fun that you could have had with it. If you want something like it, but fun buy Just Cause 2. Play now, thank me later.

212950,2,"This game was mostly good. I played this through to completion on couch co-op with my friend. I enjoyed having this split screen co-op option. But it was over in just a few hours, very short.
There were some familiar things from the original games, mostly the enemies, but the setting and characters and even the story felt completely unrelated to the predecessors. I felt it was not nearly as much fun as the first and second Resistance games.
And the worst part was the way the game ended. It seemed to end so abruptly and unexpectedly, anticlimactically, as if the game itself was never actually finished. The developers' bosses must have said ""Hey, times up. Is it done yet?"" and they said ""Well we haven't finished it, still a long way to go."". Then they boss said ""Ship it anyway. They will buy this game on the hype alone, and no need to preserve fans since this is the last game in the series.""
The game is a $10 game at most and the story has very little to do with the Resistance story line. It's sad there will never be a fitting ending to this good series."

POSITIVES

The graphics are decent.
The voice acting is okay.

NEGATIVES

The dialogue/voice sound is too low (even though the sound options are on ""high"" in the game preferences).  After googling the problem, it seems that others have experienced the same thing.

When I start the game, after the UBISoft and Unreal splash screens go away, it takes 20 seconds for the main menu to appear...and any time that you go back to the main menu...another 20 seconds.  It's annoying and a waste of time.  A longer delay happens when a saved game is loading (50 seconds).  And if you ALT-TAB to windows and then ALT-TAB back to the game, then you will need to wait for the game to load...again.  I haven't played a game that makes you wait this much for menus and loading.

The new in-game menu is graphical, big, and right in the middle of the screen; it is a step down when compared to Chaos Theory.  Navigating the in-game menu and computers/emails is cumbersome.

The story itself takes a very odd twist after the first mission; why the twist occurs is unclear.  At first it is not clear why/how Sam becomes a double agent, and this makes the first JBA HQ mission objectives confusing.

When grabbing a rope or other objects, sometimes you have to be precisely above/below/next to the object.  If you are just a tiny bit to either side of the object, then it won't respond.

The JBA HQ map is used 4 times in the game (for 4 of 13 maps).  Maybe that is needed for the storyline, but it adds repetition to the game.  The Kinshasa map is used 3 times...more repetition.

In the JBA maps, when walking down stairs, you walk in slow motion...weird and annoying.

Safe cracking glitch/bug: For those missions that have a safe cracking objective, you must be in ""run mode"" in order to crack the safe. If not, then you can't move the safe's cylinder during the safe cracking mini-game. To be in ""run mode"", move your mouse wheel forward (or whatever key you have ""run mode"" configured to).

Some objectives are really obscure; it can be difficult to tell what you are supposed to do next, and where you should go, and why.  If you get frustrated, use a walkthrough.

The in-game maps are cumbersome and useless.

OTHER

The story is just so-so.  Having both JBA and NSA people talking to you at nearly the same times during missions seemed fake.  I played about half of the game, and then I quit playing.  I just got bored with it and lost interest.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Clancy-s-Splinter-Cell-Chaos-Theory/dp/B0002V59V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</a>&nbsp;was much better.

490420,2,"It is a very fun game, just with not-balanced AI. I played single campaign, not multiply. It is nice to manage three planets at the same time, but it is almost impossible. I try maybe around 20 times and any time i was completely destroyed by space nuclear bomb after 30 min of gameplay. No any defense helps. Enemy just growth extremely fast even at first fight. Also it is an extremely hard to select the right unit or move units to other planet. I think, developer just was focused on design, not the action."
34972,2,"Given all the hype around this game, I had expected something phenomenal. The reality is that this is a VERY high-priced, but hom-hum, and 2nd rate effort by Sony.  Other reviewers have pretty effectively (and appropriately) flamed this title, so I'll make it quick...

Pros...

1) Excellent graphics, but nothing you haven't seen before

2) Simple UI; average gamer can be up and running in minutes

3) Huge gamespace with rich and varied character types

Cons...

1) Resource requirements are extreme (I have a system that runs Doom 3 well, but it gets severely bogged down on EQ2)

2) Lack of system availability (several hours a day, even worse on weekends) is maddening, especially given the hefty monthly recurring charge of $14.95

3) To get a character to a level where you can actually have fun requires the completion of literally dozens of stupid, poorly thought out tasks/quests (others have likened it to delivering pizzas -- IMHO, that's a pretty accurate assessment)

4) Neverending barrage of sales messages from Sony trying to get users to buy into other options, but at $14.95 month for access, I would think Sony would be embarrassed to try to get users to pay any more for this lame title -- for any game this sad, improvements/enhancements should be free

Net/net: many other options out are out there for on-line gamers that are much more fun at a lower cost.  My recommendation is to save your money and steer clear EQ2."
132558,2,"I'm a big fan of both Guitar Hero and the Nintendo DS, so there was no doubt I'd buy this game. However, the playability is just not there. The attachment for the guitar buttons does not stay on, causing the game to stop mid-song (which means you have to re-start the DS). You also have to hold the DS in a very uncomfortable position. Perhaps children or people with smaller hands can successfully play more than half of a song, but I couldn't."
99122,2,"As other reviewers here have noted, this is more akin to ""Burnout Lite"" than a real Burnout game.  I don't know what EA was thinking to release a Burnout game without the Crash Mode, but that's what they did, and it's not worth the $40 price.  If you're skeptical, rent it first...I think you'll conclude that this is the weakest of the sequels.  Note also that the game does NOT support old analog wheels or PS1 controllers...another really bad decision by EA.  Supposedly, they're making the ""real"" Burnout 5 for the PS3.  But given this sorry ripoff, it won't be a reason for me to spend my money on a new console."
312542,2,"You are better off getting a high end pack of rechargeable batteries, you can find them on Amazon for $20, where you get 4 AA batteries AND the charger. I would recommend those over this because this battery pack will die a lot quicker and you will find yourself using the charging wire more and more. The wire included isn't special either, it's a standard usb to micro usb wire, you can find that also on Amazon for $5. Overall you are better off getting some good rechargeable batteries for $20 (you'll get 4) and spending another $5 on a usb to micro usb wire."
237729,2,First of all let me point out this is a review of this system that I purchased (CECH-4001C) PS3 Super slim model only.  I bought this in November 10th 2012 and the cooling fan has failed causing the system to overheat.  Repair from playstation is $80 which also includes shipping/handling and repair (not bad except for the fact it is 2 years old).  I would consider my system lightly used.  I don't get time to play very much anymore but I have always kept up with the latest consoles and own several.  My ps1 that I bought in 1996 and my ps2 that I bought in 2001 are both still working without problems.  I have always considered the playstation a quality system.  I guess that is why I am leaving a 2 star review on a system that has barely lasted 2 years and needs to be repaired.  I absolutely love the playstation exclusive games and the fact that they have many quality games for playstation + members for free.  This review is in no way bashing Sony Playstation.  It is just the super slim model that seems to have multiple problems.
382521,2,"The pad for the head strap is held in by tiny plastic clips and can break easily. The mixer works good for mid levels only. The mic volume drifts after a few hours of use. The volume knob makes a crackling noise after a few months. There is a background hum when you have the sound turned up.
This is a low to mid level product with a high end price."
462585,2,"So one of the games has obscure trivia questions required to play, EVERY TIME. the graphics are poor on most of these. I was expecting some of the newer games, guess I should have checked the titles. You do get several games for the cost, but I would direct the money to something more enjoyable."
238311,2,"This game is visually amazing and that's about where out stops. As a movie or a mini series this game would be great...however this is supposed to be a video game!!! I'm literally playing as I write this review ( really) tap right analog,,,prompt,,,move left analog. Boring!!!!!
Oh boy and don't get me started on the disconnect controls for the entity Aiden. As a video game this ""game"" sucks! Which pisses me off because the writing is good, the concept is good, but I'm not here doing movie critiques here, like i said before it's all about the gaming experience and for me this title is snoring boring.

......Ohhhhh and one last thing my God the character walk pace is super slow!!!! That's the torture i couldn't bear in this game. I could have beat this title in a day if the protagonist walked faster than .5 Miles per hour....God! That irritated the heck out of me. I know we don't run everywhere in real life, but we also don't walk like the dead either. 2 stars."
128690,2,"Bought this for my PC to charge my battery packs while I play. I have a wireless controller (obviously) and the official Microsoft wireless adapter. So far so good, but I can't use it for awhile if I'm using a dead battery pack because it doesn't charge all that fast/much. I don't suggest buying this for someone who plays with the console the cable is short and the chargeability isn't something you'd want during a game as it will just drop without warning.

EDIT: Changing rating due to the fact that it DOES NOT charge AT ALL. The light will blink green and go out. I can still use it to play so long as it stays plugged into my controller but I have left it plugged into my computer and 360 and the rechargeable backs have not sustained any type of charge to be able to use them without the cord. If only the xBox One controllers worked with PCs that haven't upgraded to Win 10. :)"
412270,2,"I am a die hard fan of the series and I have to say this game did not meet expectations what so ever. I combat has a few minor tweaks from the Awakening play style of pairing up. For the most part that all still holds up, But the characters and story for this game are absolutely horrible. Some of the character models are even reused from awakening just with different colored hair. which blew me away. Characters are just 1 picture with a few different facial expressions, how could they not have just made all new characters. The story is super watered down compared to the plot of any of the other fire emblem titles. the Villain is straight forward and just a generic ""bad guy for the sake of being a bad guy"". I completed this game but I would say there is nothing that this title brings that would make it worth playing over replaying Awakening instead."
179412,2,"I expected higher quality graphics and for the price a lot more game.  I'm still forcing myself to play it but I purchased Midnight Mysteries: Devil on the Mississippi and I can't stop playing that one.

This is not my favorite and if it wasn't for all the positive feedback, I probably would have skipped it."
250984,2,"The extra ways to do things in the game actually made it more difficult and less fun. As the series continues, I learn how much I miss the first one. It was so simple, relaxing, and fun. Sigh."
153008,2,"I am so torn in my view of this game. i was thoroughly enjoying every bit of it. the puzzles were well crafted and the environments were gorgeous. The storyline was taking shape well, and then i hit an unjumpable pit, literally. The programmers have already issued a notice about this, but that doesn't help when i have to restart the game from the beginning because i didn't create an extra manual save point before the midgard serpent chapter. At this point, if this bug is encountered, a ramp will not appear that is required to jump the pit. There is no way around this and the pain and frustration of finding an uncompleted puzzle has been realized. I so wished i could have finished this game, but my frustration of spending a few hours trying to solve this puzzle before researching it made me wish i had created that savepoint. I hate pulling down the rating of such a beautiful game, but that bug killed my enthusiasm. If you are reading this right now, please look this bug up to ensure your completion of this game or else you'll find the same infuriating pit i had been led to."
110000,2,"Need for speed has been dependable for a long long time. Sure it was generic and we got one every year. This time, it took a big U turn. Every thing we liked in the past games are gone. Just after 15 min the game get so boring you will never touch the controller again. Probably it is a Wii port up. Cars looks good. Environment all look like a Wii/PS2 game. Stay with Carbon for now."
329690,2,"This fits great in my cabinet, next to my XB1 & saves me $$$/time on battery replacement. The flaws are that sometimes the XB1 controller will not charge while in the base. The reason is the gold contacts on the XB1 charger base do not register. I end up using a pocket knife & pulling the gold contacts out a little bit. But after a few uses, you have to do it again. Also the 2nd time I ordered this, the rechargeable battery would flash & would not recharge anymore. I also own the Nyko charger base for 360 & love it; a much better design. If you are considering purchasing this, I would recommending buying this new versus used or AWD.
I ordered this 3x from Amazon Warehouse Deals -
1st order - they send only the base without the batteries or covers
2nd order - they send it complete, but the 2nd battery will not recharge anymore
3rd order - they send an Xbox 360 controller charging station
4th order - waiting for delivery (bought New from Amazon)"
268088,2,"I ordered this item and upon delivery one fan was broken so i informed amazon and a replacement was shipped immediately. Once i received it the second time,one of the fans were not working. Couldn't deal with the hassle of getting another so i decided to just use it with the one fan which doesn't really do it's job. PS3 still remains quite hot. Perhaps if both fans worked it would cool better but i am not in a position to comment. The 3 USB ports are a nice touch but if only one fan works...what's the point? After all i paid for the full package unless of course it's normal for only 1 fan to work in which case it still isn't doing it's job as the PS3 is still very hot"
53304,2,"Ok, I bought Hitman: Contracts and thought that it would be a great TPS/stealth game. Alas, it wasn't to be. For a start, the game itself doesn't play all that well, with less than adequate framerates (even though my computer specs are higher than what is recommended)

I found it extremely difficult, even on Easy, to approach a guard and kill him stealthily, without alerting the other guards and causing a bloodbath. I understand the game requires patience but I'm not going to remain hidden in the shadows for 10 minutes just so that I can assassinate a couple of guards.

The controls are also annoying and take alot of time to get used to, even if you configure them to your own liking. There also don't appear to be any health packs so that you can replenish your health. If you die, you die, and there's nothing you can do about it. It may be more realistic that way but it's also less enjoyable.

There are also a limited number of saves (7) that you can use for each mission. So, for example, if you did a quick save and suddenly lost most of your energy early on in the game, it will be almost impossible to complete the mission without starting right from the beginning, which makes it very cumbersome.

All in all, I was very disappointed and from a personal point of view, would not recommend this game."
438798,2,"I've been playing Madden games since Madden NFL 11. The Madden franchise is the one I look forward to the most every year. Fast Forward to Madden NFL 17; Major Dissapointment! Ultimate Team this year is more ""Pay To Have The Best"" than ever! Meaning that you have to fork out a lot of money to keep buying packs to have the best players, and Ultimate Team is as hard as I've ever seen it. Franchise Mode is the only reason why I gave this 2 stars instead of of just one. It makes me wonder if Madden NFL 18 will be the same because if it is I will demand a refund!"
370228,2,I specifically bought this to have a semi wireless controller and use the semi trigger function in mario sunshine where i can spray water but keep running this controller does not support it very disappointed with that on top of that the left trigger is raised way too high up and makes for an uncomfortable fit controller also looks quite cheap which it was so i can let that slide it only gets the second star because now i have an extra gamecube option for a guest for the occasional smash bros party

349395,2,"I have no idea what the designers could have been thinking. This is actually as much of a platforming game as it is a shooter. And the collecting of oxygen - oh my God, was that irritating. I play Borderlands because I love to shoot and loot. Did the creators actually think its audience wanted more jumping and endless searching for hard to find waypoints?"
381385,2,"Quality control is awful. After only 40 hours in Dark Souls, the B button began sticking and having awkward feedback. Needling it with some alcohol did the trick, but now the right thumbstick is sticking when pressed in a certain direction. To top all of this off, the right bumper is now not responding every 1 out of 10 clicks or so. The materials are very cheap.

The feel is more dinky overall than the 360 controller, and the bumpers are more awkward to access. If you don't put batteries in it, you can feel the awkward lack of weight from that compartment, and the battery compartment cover does not remain in place (it slides slightly upon touching it, which you'll do often, making a clinking noise.

It barely feels more high quality than a cheap third party controller."
399670,2,"Have been playing a lot of these spy games. This one is NOT awesome at all. The most worst I want to complaint is there is no map! You cannot even see the whole site. That's why most time you just going back and forth like a sucker. Once you make a small mistake and let the guy see you, you need to reload from the check point. What a waste of time! Playing this game just likea gamble. I see some walk through online. The player just walk next to the enemy without being seen! So unreasonable! How dare a new guy doing something like this! By common sense no one will do such thing. So for most players, there is only two way to finish this game. First is spend countless time to kill and hide the enemy one by one. Second is try to go risky by walking through the enemies by killing nobody. Once you are not lucky (most time) and being found, reload. What a boring game!"
32874,2,"This game is hours of mindless frustration, and boredom.  If you don't love slasher films, this game is gonna [stick]!  The camera angle is terrible and you have no control over it, which makes aiming nearly impossible.  The bad guys(zombies with guns)pop out of nowhere continuously like Night Caster, and i have OFTEN gotten so many enemies on the screen that the game bogs down.  While the glorious xbox does its best to make the game pretty the animation is terrible, and cut scenes look like the PS one.  All in all this game isn't worth [the price].  Hang onto your money and wait for the price to come down-way down-like used.  Or buy a good game, HALO,JSRF,Gotham Racing,GunValk,BloodWake. Im taking mine back today."
363521,2,I love the Lara Croft series. I think it is one of the best in all of gaming history. This game however feels very incomplete after the 40% mark. It suddenly and without reason turns into a shooter game. Up till this point you were looking for tombs and artifacts while occasionally shooting the bad guys(Trinity). It is like the developers got lazy or ran out of time and just gave up. Where before the 40% mark you couldn't walk very far without encountering a interactive object. After 40% you can run for ever and not come a crossed anything but bad guys. Very disappointing!!
416993,2,"two reasons why i choose two stars one is this isn't much of a celebration since this is a reboot and doesn't have any of original characters and gameplay formula also lara is too much of a cry baby it's what nintendo did to metroid when they changed and ruined samus my other reason is how over emotional they made lara compared to when core design originally made her to be as well as tomb raider games i grew up playing and for the fact that these reboots are having a higher rating than any of the originals is a insult and i forgot to mention  u cant explore the mansion/ croft minor  like  every other tr game b4 the reboot even tho they show lara in croft minor in the story mode
my thoughts ""Upon release, Rise of the Tomb Raider was critically acclaimed, with critics praising its graphics, gameplay, and characterization.'' not because of storytelling which is average. i ppl are just too focus on graphics and realism and not storytelling which all of the originals even that other reboot ""underworld"" when square enix took over from core design after their failures with angel of darkness and the creator of lara croft Toby Gard distances himself from tomb raider franchise once tr gain alot of popularity to the point that ppl wanted to change his creation without talking to him first but thats another story away

now as far as the story *SPOILERS
 ""it begins at full speed, with protagonist Lara Croft and Jonah, one of her companions from the last game, journeying into the frigid mountains of Siberia. Through some flashbacks  both in cutscene and playable form  we learn that Lara is on the trail of an artifact and a lost city, two myths that her father swore were real before a tragic death. As the adventure progresses, Lara finds herself up against Trinity, a shadowy organization looking for the same historical discoveries for more malevolent purposes. Lara ignores her and organises an expedition to Syria, hoping to uncover the tomb of the Prophet of Constantinople, a key figure in the legend of Kitezh. Although successful, the tomb is empty, and Lara is interrupted by Trinityan ancient order of knights that now exists as a paramilitary organization investigating the supernaturaland their leader Konstantin. As she flees, Lara discovers a symbol etched into the tomb that she links to a book on Russian religious history in her father's study. A Trinity assassin steals the book, prompting Lara and her friend Jonah to give chase in Siberia. When the two are separated after an avalanche, Lara is forced to go on alone.

Lara discovers that Trinity has taken over a Soviet-era mining installation as a base of operations in the search for Kitezh. She is caught attempting to retrieve the book and placed in a prison cell with Ana. Konstantin forces Lara to reveal what she knows by slowly strangling Ana in front of her, but Lara is unable to tell anything of use. Ana then reveals herself to be Konstantin's sister and Trinity's spy who has been manipulating her father. The two interrogate her as to the whereabouts of the ""Divine Source"", an artifact believed to grant immortality. Lara escapes, and in the process aids Jacob, a mysterious stranger who leads her through the mines into the valley beyond. Jacob is revealed to be the leader of the Remnant, the descendants of the followers of the Prophet of Constantinople. As Lara aids in their resistance against Trinity, she begins to learn more about the deathless Prophet and the lost city of Kitezh. After being branded a heretic and pursued by the Order of Trinity, the Prophet and his followers resettled in Russia, where they built Kitezh. However, spurred on by agents of Trinity, the Mongol Hordes led by Genghis Khan attacked the city, and the Prophet was forced to sacrifice it to protect the Divine Source. The Remnant escaped and settled in the area, vowing to defend the city's secret. Jacob warns her that although the Divine Source exists, it is not what she expects it to be. Konstantin's forces repeatedly attack the Remnant, believing them to be heretics and justifying the slaughter as God's will. However, Lara discovers that Ana is dying and has been manipulating her brother to find the Divine Source and save her.
Jacob and Lara decide that the only way to protect the Divine Source is to retrieve it before Trinity can. In order to do this, Lara recovers the Atlas, an artifact that serves as a map of Kitezh. She is reunited with Jonah, who has been spying on Trinity forces, and they locate the path into the city. However, Konstantin has been aware of Jonah's presence and let him go free in the hopes that he would lead them to Lara. Trinity then attacks and take Jonah and the Atlas. Lara goes after Trinity and tries to rescue Jonah, but before she can free him, Konstantin stabs him and escapes. Lara takes Jonah to Jacob, who miraculously heals Jonah. Jacob then admits that he is the deathless Prophet himself. With Trinity advancing on the glacier that rests over Kitezh, Lara is forced to enter the city through the Path of the Deathless where she encounters the Deathless Ones, the immortal guardians of the city. Following the journals of a Trinity agent embedded in the Mongolian forces, Lara realizes the truth of Jacob's warning: the Divine Source grants immortality to the person who beholds it at the cost of their sense of self, and the Deathless Ones are the hollow immortal inhabitants of Kitezh who no longer know anything else but defending the city. As Lara enters Kitezh, the Remnant rally to attack the Deathless Ones, giving her time to reach the heart of the city. She encounters Konstantin blocking the path and mortally wounds him; he dies in disbelief that he was not carrying out God's will, but Ana's. Before his death, he claims that Lara's father did not commit suicide, but was in fact murdered by Trinity. Lara is too late to stop Ana from retrieving the Divine Source, a large glowing crystal, but wrests it from her before Ana can use it. Lara then smashes the Divine Source, killing the Deathless Ones and taking away Jacob's immortality. However, he is happy that his death has finally come and thanks Lara for bringing his end as he peacefully disintegrates. In the aftermath, Jacob's daughter Sofia takes over the Remnant. Jonah recovers from his wounds and joins Lara in planning their next expedition, with Lara vowing to investigate more of the world's mysteries as well as thwart Trinity's plans. A post-credits scene shows Lara and Ana leaving Russia, two weeks before Lara returned to the manor. Lara confronts Ana about whether Ana killed her father. Ana denies it, despite admitting that Trinity gave her the order. Before she can reveal anything else, a sniper shot hits Ana, killing her instantly. The sniper asks his unseen superior about killing Lara, but is told to stand down for the time being.""

to me this doesn't feel like tomb raider anymore
with elements that make this game as a combined copy of uncharted with things such as crafting and upgrade system & Tedious resource gathering and over dramatic sequences  also online co-op/ mutiplayer is also average bcuz not only your character die way to fast and there's not health meter to me it lacks just like that 2013 reboot i really don't care for graphics as much as new gamers but i do look for advance gameplay and this game and that other reboot doesn't have that at all and all the reasons why i used to love lara and tom raider games in the first place The best parts of Rise of the Tomb Raider's optional content are the tombs themselves.  Some fans were bothered by how the 2013 reboot featured very few tombs, temples and other similar archaeological discoveries, and how it forced them into side areas. That latter issue hasn't changed, but there must be over a dozen of these optional tombs now., and the puzzles they task you with solving are wonderfully designed. with a lot of difficulty
 Rise of the Tomb Raider has also greatly expanded the crafting system from the previous game. Lara can now craft a number of different types of ammunition on the fly,(not unlimited like any of the originals) while choosing from bigger upgrades to her arsenal of weapons at base camps. The resource system feels a little loosely implemented
WRAP UP:
RISE OF THE TOMB RAIDER EXECUTES THE FRANCHISE FORMULA WITH CONFIDENCE sort of but
In many ways, could be viewed as a fairly modest sequel. It successfully builds off Crystal Dynamics' unnecessary reboot, but it does introduce massive changes spitting distance of the previous games including lara main weapon that was substituted with a bow instead of two pistols"
152596,2,"MAMBO JUMBO has developed a number of great games (ZUMA springs to mind!). Unfortunately, this one is not one of them...

You get to choose the lot, decide on what type of house to built, take or reject the incoming offers. Repeat. For as long as you can take it. Well, I could not take it for long as it got pretty old. Fast.

This is an example of what has come to be known as Casual Gaming: small, resource-flexible games that are fun for the whole family. It would not be a bad idea to download the 60-min trial version from a casual games site, such as REFLEXIVE (you can Google it), and decide for yourself whether this is indeed your cup of tea.

40344,2,"I will list the reasons why this game doesn't add up.  First and foremost, controlling the character (Hammond) is almost impossible.  He runs slower than my grandmother, and as he loses health, he runs even slower.  He cannot run up or down stairs-- he tends to prance up them-- not kidding.  The characters use the F word in every cutscene, which is just stupid.  When your player gets in a car, he cannot drive more than 40 mph for some reason, regardless of the type of automobile.  You cannot shoot weapons out of cars while you drive, yet other gang members can shoot at you from their cars.  In out-of-vehicle gun battles (on foot) auto aim is sluggish and often unreliable.  When you get shot, you have to limp to a wall and lean there for 60 seconds to regain health, which gets annoying when gang members are shooting at you.  controls are HORRIBLE, and the weapons selection is very limited (shotguns, MP-5's and AK-47s are the most powerful weapons.
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:  The Getaway has incredible graphics and takes place in a virtual London (downtown area) that is almost a replica of the British city.  Real brand names exist-- you can see popular fast-food places and clothing stores, which adds a lot of realism.  All the major London landmarks are in the game, Buckingham Palace, Trefalgar Square, Big Ben/Parliament, Tower of London/museum, London Eye, etc.. The traffic AI is very impressive, and there are many more cars on the streets than in the popular GTA3 games.
Summary: Graphics and cityscape are very realistic, but the sluggish play control makes the game very annoying."
215427,2,The sequel to Carnival Games comes to you complete WITHOUT the best feature of the original - competition mode.  Whichever genius figured eliminating multiplayer game functionality and features in the sequel to this multiplayer oriented game was a good idea hopefully has his head on a stake.  My family and I were really excited about getting this game until we got it and found that out.  All that is there now is the boring head to head mode that is over as fast as it starts and has no point really.  May as well just be a single player game now.  Do yourself a favor and get the original - it is WAY more fun.

119909,2,"I thought this would be an awesome exploring game, especially for my younger son, but I tried it first and thought it was kind of hard to figure out how to swim, but we are new to the Wii, so then my 9 year old tried it and after about 15 minutes, he said it was to boring.
Then later my husband tried it out, figured out how to swim, explored for about an hour and then he also said it was not very exciting.  I think if some things were changed to make it more exciting, then the idea is wonderful, but for now...we wish we hadn't bought it.  Sorry!"
153861,2,"I was going through a withdraw of HM while i was away at school without my wii, so i bought this game....

269791,2,"Visually beautiful, but so linear and contrived. If you enjoy trying to find the exact sequence of key presses somebody decide you had to make, plus the exact mouse manipulation needed, in order to participate in endless chases where one wrong move, or a screw-up in the AI means you restart all over again, then have at it. I got a good way through the game and just became more and more frustrated. To the point where I gave up. Too tedious. Too frustrating a control system."
386060,2,"If your going to re-release it for other platforms, there is no excuse to give it to pc and the other consoles.

I didn't have a lot of crashes that have been reported by other people so I'm guessing they have most of it fixed. My biggest problem was the game was just plain out boring. They tried to shoehorn multiplayer into the game and it just ruined it. After 40 hours I threw in the towel and gave up, I just dreaded playing the game it just wasn't fun."
456805,2,"I recently got right into the ""NBA Street vol"" games, and I figured it was going to be hard to top those games on PS2, but then I read a few of the 4 star reviews here and people seemed to be praising the game, and a few said it was even better then ""NBA Street"", and that this game supposedly had the best controls for a basketball game on PS2. What misleading lies I beleive those reviews to be now. I think a person or persons is having a laugh on this site by giving good reviews to such a poor game.

First off, this game is simmilar to ""NBA Street"", which is pretty much an adaption of the ""NBA Jam"" games. However, this version is only one on one play. There is one other mode of 1 on 1 on 1 that allows 3 players to play at once, against each other, but as much as it sounded interesting at first, it's as annoying to play as the regular 1 on 1 modes in this game, as it makes matches longer, more frustrating, and fewer points awarded to your profile to unlock anything you want to eventually do in the game with custom created players.

How long can one on one match ups last and remain fun? It took me 3 hours maybe before I was bored to death with the lack of options of gameplay this one here offers. I think I mentioned in my review of ""NBA Street Vol 2 or 3"" that an improvement could have been offering a one on on mode, but after playing ""Ballers"", it makes me think that the team of ""Street"" probably did explore that possibility, and found it to be as boring as playing this game here.

So, onto some other bad points. Loading times are ridicules. It takes about 3 minutes to power up this game and get through all the stupid copyright and intro screens before you are finally asked to press start, and even then doing so, more loading time for the games main menu. If you accidentally go back to the title screen, guess what, more loading time just to go back to the menu screen again. It's even worse when you pick players, but it's defaulted to the Eastern NBA stars, you then have to press O to go to the list of team categories, then select one with NBA stars, legends and custom players scattered all over the place. The selection menu is atrocious.

Once you do get into the game, and you have skipped the annoying MC Paronormal or something, you finally begin to play, but are then bombarded with pop-up boxes explaining what button does what... is there no way to ever turn that off? Then the action begins, and you are forced to pretty much just keep smashing the ball into your opponents face and running for the basket for a dunk, because for the most part, no matter what your chars stats are, they will miss a jump shot from anywhere. Even with new dunks unlocked, you feel very limited to what you can do after a while, and that's something this game will never hold a candle to when compared to the ""NBA Street"" series, it's controls where smooth, easy, and fun to use, where as this game here tried something simmilar, but feels less responsive to any variety of dunks you can preform. I also miss the turbo blocking, because block's in this game are just a random act of 50/50.

The create a baler I will say is about the only decent thing about this game. You can make better looking ballers then that in NBA Street games, however, later with the lack of options and moves to do, it's just nice looking set of graphics covering the dung programming hiding behind it. The create a ballers process also only provides you a certain amount of points to use for creating skills and looks, and then you have to play matches to earn more... why must video game makers beleive that is what players want? It's a no wonder the NBA Live series is so popular, at least when you created a player you don't have to play 10,000 matches to finally max out the created players stats, and by the time you do that, you are completely sick of a game. this game here allows you to start off by giving a maximum of 35 points in one skill level, later when you edit your character again you can advance up to 99.... why? someone tell me whose stupid idea it was and in what game they did that first where someone figured it would be more fun to make you earn your stats rather then just create, adjust, play!?

Filling up the rest of the disk where space could have been used to create more options, modes and more than just 1 on 1 matches are a bunch of pointless NBA videos of a bunch of guys you will probably never have any interest in ever watching their video anyway... it only took me a glance at looking at Dominque Wilkins 1 minute video of NOT the best highlights of his career and him saying, ""I love to play the game"" with that annoying ""letssssssssss get ready to rumbleeeeeeee"" guy talking over it.

While I'm on that, the music in this game is just horrendous. A bunch of nobodies rapping about how they gonna be the streets and earn money in the nba someday... gimme a break, PAY FOR A DECENT SET OF SONGS, there is no way anyone could have been paid to write and record that.

I'm done ripping on this game, i've said my piece, flipped it the bird, and thrown it's ballers in the bin."

414713,2,"Update  The mouse has failed and I have modified my rating.  Less than 6 months old, and the cursor jumps all over the place

Really disappointing because I sure love everything about it.  And it was at a killer price
But the short life makes it a bad value. I have a Microsoft mouse I bought I bought 5 years ago and it is still going strong. In fact, this is the first mouse since I had an Atari that had a failure.  Not gonna one star it because I have another I bought a week later and it is going strong
I recall which is which because this one was purchased for my new computer, the other for the office.

I love this mouse, this is the second one I bought.  Except for the seller incorrectly listing it as 8000 dpi instead of 9200, I have no complaints.  Well maybe a teensy one.  I wish the feet were more slippery"
400000,2,"I had such high hopes for this game after playing WWE Smack down vs Raw 2009. I felt that it was time for me to get back into the series, but unfortunately it was a bad time to do so. The game itself is nice to look at since the improvements in the graphics compared to '09. The story of stone cold is surprisingly good and kept me hooked. Now the bad part that totally killed it for me. The controls for this game are horrible and good to laugh at. The reversal controls are horrible. You are suppose to move the analog sticks until you hit the spot, which honestly is idiotic. The older controls were definitely better than this garbage. Honestly if they kept the original controls this game would easily be a 5 star game."
217456,2,"Stay clear of this game.  No one was looking forward to this game more than I, but it's hardly a game at all.  Seemingly, the only part of this game that works right is the time trial mode.  The minute you enter a race weekend, it's just one development flaw after another.

-AI cars(artificial intelligence, or computer controlled cars) don't pit in some races even though all drivers in F1 are required to pit at least once during a race.

-Tire punctures are random and having nothing to do with tire wear or driving habits.
  Here is video proof: [...]

-AI qualifying times are predetermined.  They don't really achieve them.

-AI cars malfunctioning and partially disappearing in the road or walls.
  Video proof:  [...]

-AI cars such as Virgin and HRT are fully capable of finishing mid-field, or even winning races.

-""The Pit Bug"".  Your team will keep you in the pit box or garage for a lengthy amount of time while all other cars in the pit lane drive by.  (Provided that the AI cars actually decide to follow the rules and pit.

Codemasters has said that they are looking into these design flaws.  It's possible that a few of the many bugs can be fixed via update over the internet, but that remains to be seen.  And if that is an option, only players with high speed internet would be able to take advantage of it.

You can visit the Codemasters F1 forum at [...] to read about all of the different problems people all over the world are having with this game.  Those of us who bought the game have been robbed. I was generous in giving 2 stars because I typically love doing time trials in racing games and so far that seems to work okay.  That's still not worth the cost of the game though."
293617,2,"This charge hub is underpowered which causes unnecessary hassles.

The charger needs to be plugged into an outlet AND a PS3 USB port in order to charge Dualshocks or Move controllers (I tested both). There are plenty of 3rd-party chargers that work fine plugged into an outlet only. I suspect the reason this Amazonbasics charger needs dual plug-in is because it is a low-voltage charger that needs the extra juice from the PS3.

Other observations:
-When the PS3 is off, the controllers do not charge. This can be a big inconvenience.
-It does not power any PS3 device (Dualshock, Move, Eye) when plugged into only an outlet OR only a PS3 USB port.
-When plugged into an outlet and a generic 2.1 amp USB charger, the controllers do not charge.

The output listed on the AC adapter is 2.0 amps. Divide this among the 4 USB ports and you are only getting 500ma per port which is very weak these days.

If you plan on buying this as a generic USB hub to charge non-PS3 devices like phones, tablets, etc., it does work for this purpose as a low-voltage charger only. When I plugged in my Kindle, it gave me a low-voltage charger notification (this means it will take a much longer time to charge compared to a better powered charger). Thus it is not ideally suited to be a universal charging hub.

Note: Two usb to mini-USB cables are included and 1 of them needs to be plugged into your PS3. So if you want to charge more than 1 device, you will need to supply the necessary cable.

The bottom-line is this charger works but it utilizes a PS3 USB port and is generally underpowered. Nothing will charge when the PS3 is off which is a major negative.

Instead of this charging hub, I would recommend getting one of the dozens of charging stations (search Amazon for ""ps3 charging station"") that works via outlet only thus independent of PS3 status."
197539,2,"We currently own 3 PSPs (3 kids) and one of my kids really, really wanted an upgrade to the Go because he thought it would be a cool gadget. Luckily, a classmate of his got one last week and when he came to play the online Uncharted 2 yesterday he brought his new Go along - I asked him to bring 'everything' the Go came with so that we could evaluate it and decide on the upgrade.

This is what we found.

THE GOODS

- Being smaller, it's a lot easier to carry it around.
- It's a really good-looking gadget.
- The smaller screen looks sharper because it has the same resolution as the larger 3000 screen.
- The 14GB of usable internal memory can hold quite a few games, especially if you don't fill it up with movies.
- Cell phone tethering is a good download option if you have a good cell phone plan.
- Bluetooth allows pairing with any headsets.
- Allows to pause a game the come back later and resume play.

THE BADS

- Proprietary charger.
- Proprietary USB cable for data transfer.
- Memory Stick M2 is one of the more expensive cards.
- Replacing battery will void the warranty.
- 802.11b is the slowest Wi-Fi, downloads take a long time.
- Analog joystick hard to use by grownups.
- Impossible to transfer games/movies already purchased on UMD's
- Not all popular PSP games are available as downloads and some downloads cost more than the UMDs.
- Higher price does not seem to be justified by features.

OUR DECISION

After playing with the Go while my son's classmate managed to actually blow up a pair of speakers playing the online Uncharted 2 (true, but it was really my fault for hooking up some old speakers to a new receiver) my son decided that he didn't want one.

The deal breaker was the 'downloads only' with no migration path for existing games. We have more than a dozen PSP games already, a pretty serious investment including some new ones (Crisis Core, Dissidia) and he didn't think that the sleek Go was sleek enough to justify his starting with new games. There's nothing to prevent us from downloading minis or full games from the PSP store if we ever wanted to go that way but going the Go way would narrow our options. It would be nice to have Bluetooth and a pause option but it's a lot easier to live without those than without all the games we've bought over the past couple of years and all the flexibility that the PSP-3000 affords us.

Besides, our kids do borrow games from friends to play over the weekend and lend their games to their friends. Not to mention that a couple of our games we bought on UMDs as 'used' and they sold a few of the games they got tired off. None of the these would be possible on the Go.

In the end, it was an easy decision. We won't be buying a Go at this time and we can't think of circumstances under which we would want a Go.

RATING

Amazon's '3 stars' means ""it's Okay"" but the Go is not Okay for us. I understand that those who don't own any PSP games, would never consider trading or selling the games they buy, don't care about proprietary chargers, USB cables, memory cards and batteries and have no problems with slow downloads may actually be happy with a Go but we do not belong to that group so we can only grant '2 stars' - the several improvements (Bluetooth, pause features) saved the Go from a more embarrassing 1-star score.

215786,2,"Pretty good installment into the franchise. Very fun single player mode. This game brings the franchise back to the roots of need for speed, and has simplified gameplay. Below i will list pros and cons.

Pros:
-great single player mode
-fun online action
-Great Graphics.

Cons:
-This game has no multiplayer mode, only xbox live. So if you like to have friends over, huddled in front of the tv and have a great time, forget about it.
-No Customization. The cars only have a few color selections after you pick your car, that's it. Everybody looks the same online.
-Lame maps. Its all country roads. Long stretches, country views. For the most part that's it. I was hoping there would be at least a few town settings, like there was in past installments. But there isn't. There is really nothing to do in free roam mode either. (simplified game, no shops, no customizing, no nothing)

Final Thoughts. Although this is a fun game, it is lacking a lot. They could have simplified the game, bringing the franchise back to its roots, but left some things. Actually heck, Back in the day it actually had multiplayer. In my opinion, Rent before you buy. Or wait till this hits platinum hits and gets tossed in the $20 dollar section."
208871,2,"First let me preface this by saying Dragon Age: Origins was a great experience all around, but this is more like a overpriced DLC, its very short and feels rushed in some areas. The story and the characters are interesting as is normal for Bioware Games however much like their other DLC is too short and falls short of the potential. This product was also made by the DLC team so it should be no surprise it suffers from the same problems.

The best thing Bioware could ever do was fire their entire DLC team and just let the much better Main Game Development teams make the DLC too."
186425,2,"I must admit I was quite excited for The 40th Day. I enjoyed the previous installment in the series and had fairly high expectations for the second. So I sat down and put the game in and waited to be wowed. And then I waited. And waited. And waited some more. And then the credits rolled.

The 40th Day isn't an awful game but all the things that made the first game memorable like the co-op mechanisms, the tongue in cheek bromance, the ambiguous morality and the hard fighting brutality were completely underdeveloped here. The strength of a sequel over a new title is that a dev team can take all the popular aspects of a previous game and with that previous experience up the ante and redeliver a superior product based on those known strengths and weaknesses. Instead with the 40th Day you get exactly the same thing as before with an even thinner story (which I didn't thing possible) and a less engaging aesthetic. There is basically nothing here that makes me believe that a single lesson was learned from the previous title.

The controls are wonky but not intrusively bad. I did have an unexplainable bug where after I came back from turning off the game the Y-axis reset to un-inverted and I couldn't change it back. So if you're a freak of nature like me and play with an inverted Y-Axis be on your guard. The bug might make this game unplayable.

Also be warned: if you're looking for single player play time then don't put down your money on buying this game. I finished this game in less than six hours on Hard. There are a few unlockables but nothing to make it worth really playing through the campaign again. My recommendation would be to rent it and based off how much you enjoy the multi-player consider buying a copy then.

As far as the actual game play is concerned I was never once really engaged. The enemies have a very limited number of very jerky animations and their AI is unsatisfying. Like many poorly designed games that place an emphasis on the use of cover you'll often find yourself feeling like you're playing a game of wack-a-mole where you sit behind your cover and they sit behind theirs as you wait for them to lean out to ineffectually spray bullets at you. The enemies are not challenging and most of the episodes were you find yourself being challenged is when due to the design of the spawn points and the poor camera angles a half dozen opponents appear behind you. They're mostly carbon copies of each other, some with helmets and some with body armor but it's all the same deal. This is mixed up by having the occasional mini-boss which is decked out in heavy armor and has a special weapon like a Gatling gun or a grenade launcher. Between the combat cover mechanic and the cheesy pseudo-anime looking enemies I felt like I had traveled back in time fifteen years and was playing Time Crisis at the arcade again and not in a good way.

This is all interrupted by situations where you can take hostages and/or rescue civilians. While that sounds fun, and it is at first, it wears off about an hour into the game due to the fact that it's the same situation every time and you're never presented with a reason or a reward that makes you care. This brings me to the ""moral choices"" in the game. One of the great ideas in the game that had simply terrible execution the moral choices have almost no affect on the storyline or the game play. There are some items and weapon parts you can get one way as opposed to the other but they're not really a big deal and don't much alter the way you play the game or the manner in which it is or isn't enjoyed. You could be totally good or totally bad without significant alteration in the basic experience.

The second incredibly disappointing aspect of the game was the weapon modification. This is another idea that just never really seemed to get off the ground which is bizarre considering the attention and marketing it got as a component of the game. While you can change out barrels and add new sights or stocks, etc there is very little substantial difference in the weapon platforms. Once you buy one modification or the other it makes little difference what your ""base"" weapon is. Also the modifications themselves are limited and uninspired. With all the focus placed on attaining money in the game you'll find little reason to actually spend it as none of the mods have a real ""fun"" factor to them and their effect on your game play is minimal.

The multi-player is adequate but I don't see any shooter fan who owns a copy of Modern Warfare 2 spending enough time play The 40th Day to justify a purchase. You'll also notice that since you didn't pre-order a copy you don't yet have access to the Extraction feature of the game for a month. Note to EA: put a $10 mail in rebate or a poster or the such in your pre-orderers boxes. Leaving out an entire portion of your game for one of the most critical time periods for the sale of your product is incredibly stupid. Basically what EA has done is create the illusion of pre-orderers getting ""extra material"" by taking it away from everyone else. What a clever way to screw over your customers. Fire the guy that came up with that.

Bottomline: The game is a decent but not impressive 6 hours duck and shoot exercise. Unless you simply loved the multi-player portion of the first game I wouldn't recommend paying retail for this one. A rental isn't out of the question for a lazy weekend but with Bioshock 2, Mass Effect 2 and Modern Warfare 2, all vastly superior sequels, out or soon to be I'm not sure I'd argue you'll have more fun with this in your 360.

Pros:
*Good looking graphics, nice textures.
*Not too hard, not too easy.
*Curb stomping.

Subjective qualities:
*Simple combat mechanics.
*Check point save system.
*Not overly tactical, very shoot 'em up.

Cons:
*Terrible story.
*Very short.
*Undeveloped core concepts (weapon mods and moral choices).
*Painfully cliche aesthetics.
*Simple AI.
*Goofy Achievements.
*Little variation in play.
*Wonky Controls.
*You don't get the whole game you pay for on release (Extraction)."
126914,2,"As a child I LOVED these games. King's quest 7 is my favorite which is why I bought this. However, make sure your computer is compatible because I have spent the last 2 hours trying everything I can to get the games to work with no luck. I will change this review if I ever get the game to work.

UPDATE: Hours later I have even managed to get my hands on Window 98. Still no luck."
25896,2,"I have all the Spyro games for PS1 & PS2, and I LOVE them, so when I got my GBA I bought Season Of Ice right away....and was very annoyed.  At first I thought it would be cool, because there are fairies and mermaids, but the controls are much more difficult on the GBA than the Playstations.  I have trouble getting Spyro to go the direction I want him to, especially on diagonals.  I think it's because you're using directional buttons instead of a joystick.  I don't think it can be the fault of the button on my individual GBA, because I bought it brand new and this is one of the first games I've played on it.  Anyway, I have trouble crossing bridges and just moving around in general; it makes it incredibly obnoxious, because every time you fall in water you die.  I say, if you have a Game Cube and a Game Boy Player (so you can use a joystick) this could be a great game, but if you just have a GBA, don't bother, it's more frustrating than it's worth."
383456,2,"Makes a god awful grinding and rumbling noise when it turns on, which wouldnt be a problem, but it happens at around 87 degrees.  You guessed it, thats the exact point your console idles at when not in use!  I have to unplug it every time im done or it wakes me up in the middle of the night.  Does a great job cooling while gaming though.  Why didn't they raise the kick on temp? Its infuriating."

It simply does not fit on an adult's head. I'd give the 2-earpiece a 4* rating and the 1-earpiece a 1* rating. It is completely un-usable.

I own a Microsoft-made 1-earpiece and it fits great. This one is simply too small."

The screen looks the same, same fuctions, even the appearance is very similar except its in girl colors!

I think the Diego is a great game for smaller kids getting used to the wii, but if youve played it before, this is about 90% exactly like it!"
323793,2,"If you don't want to read my long-winded review, cut to the bottom for my conclusion.

Packaging was excellent. Looked good. Protected the product. Only had to undo a few twist-ties that weren't overly tight.

Instructions were comically simple and effective. No words. Just images. There are 2 adapters and 1 extension. 1 adapter allows you to connect to conventional machines with separate mic & headphone jacks. Most laptops and desktops will require these. The extension connects to this adapter. The 2nd adapter allows you to connect to Apple devices like iPods, iPads, and iPhones. So they've got all your bases covered. If you want to connect to Xbox or PS, try calling SteelSeries. Perhaps they will sell you the appropriate adapter.

First thing I noticed when I placed it on my head is the comfort. It covered my ears with ample room so there was no rubbing or pressing on the lobes. The tension in the headset was just right for my head. It stayed on securely without crushing my temples. The pads are very soft. Because they fit so gently on the head, they don't seal out ambient noise as well as some other headphones I own, but it'll work well in all but the loudest gaming-lounges.

The microphone tucks out of the way, which is great. I want to use these to listen to music as well, so I appreciate that I don't look like a receptionist on the street. They were designed for gaming, which prioritizes accuracy over timbre, so these headphones sound more like monitors or DJ headsets rather than fine listening headphones. It's not a big difference, but just know you're not getting the equivalent of Grado SR80s.

The inline volume control is the size of a postage stamp. That's bigger than average, but not all that large. This makes it easier to find the controls without looking. The volume dial is too small, but it's rubberized so it's pretty easy to manipulate. The mic button is massive and very easy to manipulate.

The textile shrouding on the cables is appreciated. Not only is this more attractive, but reduces tangling.

The matte finish appears to be high quality and should hold up. Might get some shiny spots if you carry it around in a backpack a lot.

But here are my 3 negatives, some are big:

The cord lengths are not ideal. The short length looks like it was designed to connect you to your phone, tablet, or laptop. They're not quite long enough to reach the back of a PC, so you need to use the extension, but that's way too long for the application. Overall, this is a minor nuisance.

The big issue is the poor quality of the microUSB connector. Those adapters I mentioned earlier, while clever in concept, rely on a microUSB connection. However, that connection is not very good. They're easy to disrupt. While moving about, or even just typing on my keyboard, I managed to tug at the cable just slightly enough to interrupt the connection, but not pull it out. In fact, visually, you couldn't tell anything was wrong. The only way I knew was because the left channel went dead. I had to wiggle it back in place to get the sound back. This happened 4 times within an hour of unboxing. That 4th time, I must have really pissed it off. Again, I didn't strike it or pull it hard at all. Just a slight tug. Now, the only way to get both channels is to hold the connection together and apply slight pressure. Tying up one of my hands is not good for productivity.

And the last issue is that it's not compatible with all devices. My Dell laptop works just fine with my Plantronics headset, but doesn't work with the SteelSeries. The audio plug needs to be pulled most of the way out to pick up a strong signal. If you plug it all the way in like you're supposed to, you get a 90% reduction in volume. I checked the plugs. They're gold-plated and appear to be the correct length and diameter. I cannot figure out why this happens. These headphones works perfectly in my phone (headphones only - no mic).

BOTTOM LINE: Perhaps I got a dud, but I can only base my review on the unit that I received. I wanted to like this, but I can't recommend this purchase. Bad adapter connector results in silent left channel. Audio jack not compatible with all device; sharp drop in volume in both channels when used on Dell laptop.

UPDATE#1: Thought I'd give their customer service a shot. Had to answer a few questions to verify purchase. They promptly issued an RMA number and instructions for shipping it back. I'll need to pay for shipping out of pocket. They will not reimburse that expense, but they will pay to ship it back to you. That's where I draw the line.  I don't love the headphones enough to spend $5 to ship it. I may have felt differently if I'd paid full price for these, nearly an entire Benjamin. The sound quality when it was working didn't blow me away and the overall build quality leaves me thinking it will just break again, one way or another. My old Plantronics headset is more comfortable, sounds better, feel more solid, and has worked flawlessly for 5 years. It only loses to the SteelSeries in style. I'll get over."
433704,2,That's all I can really say. No where near as good as the previous games. I was disappointed.
237373,2,"For the price I suppose this is an acceptable case, but it reeks of cheap materials. I'm afraid if I just look at it the wrong way it'll fall apart. It's very light weight and the ""hard"" case is actually quite malleable as if it's just cardboard at it's core that's been covered in upholstery.
There's a system of elastic straps inside the case to hold the 3DS in place, but these are more of a nuisance than a feature as you have to awkwardly maneuver and slide the 3DS under the straps to get it in and out.
I would not trust this case to protect my 3DS from a drop at any height.

My current 3DS XL ""case"" solution is the dreamGEAR Comfort Grip. It's a soft silicone grip that encases the entire system. It protects the entire system from scratches and makes it a lot more comfortable to play. I've dropped my 3DS from hip height with this grip multiple times and it's proven to be very durable. With the grip on I can toss the 3DS in a bag and not worry about the 3DS clam shell getting scratched up, but also be able to pull it out to play in an instant.

I've tried using this AmazonBasics case, but I continue to go back to the simple grip cover instead for it's convenience and function."
249366,2,"The game only gets a 2/5 star rating from me.

The game has 2 fundamental GAME BREAKING flaws.

The first flaw is that unlike previous games, They decided to take out the RPG leveling experience. That means no exp, no items to equip and worst of all, NO LEVELING UP.

Because of the above flaw, you are stuck with a paper mario that never gets better....enemies such as goombas will always be a pain because unfortunately you cannot improve your stats to make them weaker, most goombas come in packs of 3...each do 2 damage a turn, your chracter only has 20 hp...the problem here is, even if it takes you 1 turn per goomba...well that means each fight will cost you  about 12+ health...so fighting 2 packs of 3 goombas back to back will cause you to die...and because the system doesn't have checkpoints...you will start over...DUMB!!!!

The other flaw that pisses me off to no end is the fact that healing items are so rare and hard to come by...you get 10000x crappy stickers(All attacks are stored as 1 time use items called stickers) and the healing stickers are so rare that you will almost never find them...then the shop keepers charge excessively for the individual healing stickers.

Basically, the game consists of a cycle where you make progress, with no checkpoints or healing items, get ambushed by a boss die, revert to the last save...(Starting the level over.)

This game has a wonderful assortment of colors, and a great concept.

This game also has well timed gags and funny storylines...ultimately the above flaws are so bad that I have to mentally prepare myself to play the game knowing full well I will probably get mad and not play it for a week and then repeat the cycle.

I had greatly anticipated this game and was shocked to see its price drop to $25, now I know why."
82620,2,"Preface: I am a huge fan of the original MGS1 and have played through it multiple times. It is easily the best game in the series. MGS2 & 3 had great gameplay but the cutscenes were very bloated. MGS4 continues this trend in a very bad way.

MGS4 was a big letdown for me. There are a few areas (towards the beginning) that allow for some creative, new MGS type gameplay but the areas get smaller and smaller as the game progresses.

Similarly, the story is on a downward spiral from the beginning. Overblown cutscenes are back with a vengeance, with the most drawn-out, melodramatic dialogue in the series. However, Mr. Kojima takes the crap-scenes to a new level of suck by adding lots of awkward ""fan service"" dialogue between characters. Also, the final confrontation between Snake and Ocelot/Liquid is a pathetic mess that falls flat as both a movie and a game. Go back and replay the end of MGS1 for a refresher course on how to successfully combine gameplay and cutscenes for an awesome ending.

I'd like to give this 1/5 stars but I can't deny some of the innovative gameplay the deserves some praise. Penny Arcade was right, if you want to enjoy this game at all, skip every cutscene."
13460,2,"Well, the graphics are amazing and the batter pitcher interface is smooth  and well thought out.  The rest, however, should have been worked on a  little more.
The greatest strength is by far the pitcher batter  match-up.  When playing against another player, the game simulates reality  very well.  The pitcher can set up the batter like in a real baseball game.  You can throw a fast ball high and tight, and then fake the batter by  going low and inside with a change up.
The biggest problem I have is that  about half of all at-bats are pop-ups to the infield.  The rest are  harmless grounders or strikeouts.  This game is incredibly difficult to hit  with, and makes it lack really any playability.
Other problems are that  stats are not readily available at the end of a game, the sound is  reminiscent of a bad Genesis game, controlling runners is a pain, and there  is not much control on defense.
This game is like an untested prospect,  lots of potential, but not really ready for the big time.  Best to wait for  World Series 2002, if the Dreamcast can survive that long."
71865,2,"You would think, if you truly had God on your side, you'd be able to produce a better game. However Crave's The Bible Game appears to be mostly devoid of compelling content, or honestly, any Christian message at all.
  The video game is based on a game show. That pins you against either four human or computer controlled characters. It seems decent enough however until you realize there is very little order to how the game is run. Each player takes turns randomly jumping onto different points on the game board. One of these pieces is ""The Wrath of God"", where you lose all of your points for the round if you land on it. So that we get this clear. The Wrath of God is completely random, and the deserving and undeserving are likely to fall on it. Nice way to spread the Love of God.
In the final round, Players have a chance to get some extra points from the Tree of Knowledge. If you pick any fruit, other than the apple, you get a lot of extra points. However, if you choose the Apple, you lose all of your points. Once again this is completely random, and you wonder why you should even try. This game seems to favor focusing on the mean spirited God of the Old Testament and left out Jesus altogether. Once again, Nice way to spread the love of God.
The challenges are both trivia and minigames that consist of questions that are repeated all too often. The game claims to have over 1500 Bible questions but you only have access to the questions based on the difficulty you set for the game at the beginning, so players get ripped off by not getting the total game experience.
One of the best games is the tower of Babel. This has the feel of ""stab your neighbor in the back"". Otherwise, there's just not much fun to be had. Most of the games have a Christian soundtrack so either you'll enjoy the game because you like it, or you'll enjoy it because the songs are so painfully annoying.
As a pastor, I'm embarrassed to see that this is what we Christians have to offer the public. If you just want to entertain the kiddies for a few minutes, this game is okay. Honestly, Most stories in the Bible could honestly make for an awesome gaming experience if we focused on one character such as David. But considering we are to show the excellence of God, in all that we do, this game falls way too short. There seems to be no message at all about the core belief of Jesus and what our message is, The Great Commission. If we are to spread the word, we need to start by not making bad video games.

Pros: The Tower of Babel minigame is fun
Cons: Most of the other games are boring, The game mechanics are mushy"
396121,2,"For anyone accustomed to sports games, they basically know a new year normally means an updated roster, different menus and maybe one or two new features to entice the consumer to pick it up. Madden NFL 16 for the next gen Playstation 4 and Xbox One will contain the new features that are highlighted in commercials and reviews. But for last gen, absolutely nothing is changed. It's the same game as last year, just with a nice hefty sixty dollar price tag. If you own Madden NFL 15, or heck, the last two before that. You're basically getting the same game.

If the updated roster means anything then I guess I would barely recommend it. But even then I would suggest waiting for the price to drop. Not everyone can afford the Playstation 4 as of yet, but that shouldn't give EA the right to give consumers an identical copy of last years game and expect players to be happy paying full price for a inferior version. The only other positive of buying the newest Madden on PS3 is that the previous game will have less players to match up against sense its outdated, and having the newer version would most likely give you more opponents to play against.

The PS3 like any other last gen console will always get inferior ports until the system retires, it's the way the business works. This review was just meant as a warning to anyone who may not be familiar with EA's lovely practice of releasing carbon copies for everyone to be disappointed in."
76431,2,"THERE IS NO STORY LINE WHAT SO EVER. THE GAME PLAY SUCKS! THE GRAPHICS ARE OKAY. YOUR MUCH BETTER OFF BUYING GHOST RECON ADVANCE 2, OR FEAR. THIS ONE WILL LEAVE YOU BORED QUICK."
359651,2,"Constant crashes.  The underlying game is fun, but of the 10 matches required in a single player arcade style playthrough, I can typically finish 9 before the game crashes and dumps me back to the PS4 main menu.  I'm sure the game may one day be fun, but currently it's just frustrating.  Don't waste your money on it until they fix the game.

UPDATE - it now only crashes every 15 matches or so.  That's a rough estimate, so it's not exactly like clockwork, but I can now usually play through their basic arcade style tower once before it crashes.  It still crashes at random intervals, just less frequently, so it seems like they're fixing something.  Hopefully it will get addressed soon.

UPDATE 2 - a big new update was downloaded to add Jason Voorhees to the game... sadly, no fix for the crashing still.  The brief stints playing the game are fun, but when Sub-Zero is freezing the entire console and forcing you to reboot, it's much less enjoyable than when he's just briefly freezing the other fighter. :("
212337,2,"I have played many 3rd person games on a PC but this game isn't one that I like for PPC play, the story is good just the PC game play makes this game hard to play.

I have played the 1st game on Xbox with alot of fun. and I have tried it on PC as well, I'll put it this way, I gave both games to my brother and got them for xbox cause thats the way they were made to be played. save yourself hours of yelling pass on the PC version."
143779,2,"My mistake for expecting too much out of this game. I am into more SIM style racing games so this game really isn't aimed at me. If you like arcade style ""smash'm up"" type of games. This may be for you."
180122,2,"""Hidden Secrets: The Nightmare"" is ostensibly a casual game, but I have to say, it is the least-relaxing casual game I have ever played. It's not a hidden object game in the traditional sense. Rather, in each scene you need to find anywhere from five to ten objects. So for example, you might find a hammer in a car. Then you have to turn on the car's stereo to retrieve a CD, use the hammer on the CD to break it, which you in turn use to...you get the idea. At the end of each scene you play either one or two mini-games. None of the mini-games are ground-breaking, but there is a nice variety of puzzles, and as you complete each one it becomes available for play in an arcade mode.

There's nothing terribly exciting about this game, but it could have been an amusing pastime were it not for a few flaws, most notably the time element. You get anywhere from ten to fifteen minutes to complete each scene plus mini-game(s), and that would be plenty of time were it not for the absolutely brutal time penalties. You click on the wrong item? You lose a few minutes from the clock. Click on the right items but in the wrong sequence? You lose more time. There's one point where you have to put a jar of fireflies in a car's headlight in order to see the street. (Um...okay?) If you try to click the headlight onto the jar of fireflies, you lose a bunch of time. Instead you must click the jar onto the headlights, because that clearly makes much more sense. You can get hints in each scene, but the time penalty for using a hint is so harsh that you'll probably have to replay the scene if you use one. You're basically stuck in a position where you can't get hints but you also can't click on items to experiment. Isn't that fun? Oh, wait, it's totally not.

Sometimes you'll need to play a single mini-game to finish the scene. That's fine. Sometimes, however, you have to complete each game multiple times to move on. Trust me: whatever entertainment these games might provide is quickly run into the ground when you have to play the stupid thing five times in a row. And then, for added fun, you might get hit with a second kind of mini-game which you also have to play multiple times. Grr. I also found at least one major bug, in a puzzle where you have to switch tiles to form a picture. Not only did the game not give me any idea of what the picture would look like, but three of the tiles were just black. Apparently I was supposed to see a picture on those, but as it was I had to complete the rest of the puzzle and then randomly switch around the black tiles until the game thought I was seeing a picture.

When I bought this game, I didn't realize that it was made by Brighter Minds, the same people responsible for the truly atrocious ""Mysteryville."" To be fair, this game is a bit better than that one - the artwork is much nicer, and the mini-games at least had potential. I guess that means that this game deserves two stars. It's still not very fun, though, and if you like this kind of gameplay, I'd recommend trying ""Nancy Drew Dossier: Lights, Camera, Curses"" instead. Nancy wouldn't punish you for putting your headlights in your fireflies."
262171,2,"I just completed this game last night and am now afforded the ability to browse the reviews on here (I'm a stickler for no spoilers) and formulate my own opinion.

I got this game for one main reason - it was billed as an RPG that allows you to make choices that either majorly or moderately affect the world you are in and the story of the main game.  To a certain degree, this was true - but that fact sinks to a watery grave when diluted with the game's other problems.

Graphically, the game isn't exactly spectacular - but this is being said in the afterglow of next-gen consoles and I do own an XBox One, so.....perhaps my view is muddied somewhat.  The cutscene graphics are fairly poor, and funnily enough in-game graphics are quite good (comparatively).  But - I can overlook subpar graphics for a great game.

Now, I will start with the good:

If you were looking for an RPG, then you have definitely come to the right shop!  I have missed RPG-ishness ever since finishing Skyrim (which is a game with its own issues), and it was really nice to be able to step into a fantasy world again.

You are indeed able to make decisions at key points in the game - mostly through a 'persuasion' system in dialogue options.  I like how Geralt casts some witchcraft to 'persuade' people, too - it sets him apart from the other characters.

The world is huge and varied, although I do get the impression that you are only shown a tiny sliver of it.

But now, unfortunately, for the bad:

Player connection to the playable character of Geralt is seriously impeded by the brick wall of lore you are expected to consume, process, understand and form your own feelings about.  The game does NOT ease you into the world whatsoever.  While ME2 did a great job of introducing the player to the world all over again (as Shepard had been basically resurrected), this game does NOT.  In missing the opportunity to enkindle a basic interest in the world at large in its players, The Witcher 2 has one, initial, major fatal flaw:  it failed to make me care.  In a decision-based RPG, that is VERY bad news.  I felt that I was basically a non-sentient floating through the game's books and maps and cities, being TOLD about all these other places, people and wars - but that I had absolutely NO reason to worry about any of it, or care.

The map system.  The map system is one of the main technical reasons that I did not achieve a fuller understanding of the game world and story.  I literally missed 90% of the side quests (some of which with significant stories and/or characters in them) because I was not able to follow the quest markers effectively.  You can only have one quest marker at a time on your map, meaning you have to manually choose which quest to go after.  Unfortunately, this in turn means that you may stumble into another quest (or advance the storyline) just by attempting to transition from whatever area you are in to the marked quest area.  This is very unfortunate.  Not only that, but the quest markers seemed to me to be HIGHLY unreliable, unpredictable and - at times - completely incomprehensible.  I spent literally HOURS attempting to find two guys to armwrestle in the dwarven city (Vergen, was it?).  The quest marker showed their location, at which I was standing, but they weren't there.  I went under ground, scoured the city, looked for secret doors, stumbled through catacombs (all the time initiating and completing other missions by accident), did EVERYTHING I could think of to find these guys to armwrestle - to no avail.  I can only assume that it was some kind of glitch - but unfortunately it ensured that after that point in the game, I paid almost no attention to *ANY* side quests and did not go after any of them, because I knew I could not rely on my map or the quest markers.  Major flaw and one that makes the player feel like they are bashing their head against a brick wall.

Adult material inclusion.  I welcome adult language, situations and sex/love in a game.  It makes me care, and it makes me want to succeed in a game.  I wholeheartedly encourage the use of them in all games.  However, even I was left with a bad taste in my mouth after my pummeling by The Witcher 2's profanity, sex and unbridled objectification of women.  To make matters worse (and I don't know if this is just the way I played the game or not), but I was totally unable to actually form a romantic relationship with anyone in the game.  I mean - apart from Triss, who is just sort of the cookie-cutter 'girlfriend' - but even then there was no culmination of our relationship, or after Geralt saved her.....nothing.  She even features on the front cover of the game!  But.......yeah.  Nothing.

Profanity is used frequently to the point of sounding like every second person in the game has swearword-diarrhea.  A smattering here or there to evoke the strength of emotions at certain plot points is absolutely necessary - but in this game it comes across as purely gratuitous.  Dwarves can't even pass the time of day at the market without cussing and referencing ""ploughing"" (you'll need to know some game lore to fully understand that), and you can't even go forward to attend the end-game conference at Loc Muinne without someone throwing a VERY surprising c-word around the place.  Ooookay then.
Women are treated with the maturity you'd expect from a 14-year-old in most of the game, too.  They are scantily clad (sorceresses), can't wear anything unless it has such a scoop neck that it only just covers her nipples, and are forced into baked-in storyline scenes of bondage, spanking, etc. etc.  Very disappointing.  Like I say - I still have no idea why this game has all this in it, because you actually can't romance anyone.  Mehhh....maybe my Mass Effect is showing.

Potions.  Well wow - here's a game aspect that is under developed and under used.  You cannot drink potions in battle - I repeat, you cannot drink potions in battle!!  So basically, you have to remember to 'meditate' before you ANTICIPATE there MAY be someone to fight soon, and drink your potions.  This is a terribly convoluted way to treat something that is supposed to be one of the Witcher's main methods.  Hmmm.

So, yeah.  The rest of my review really just sums up how I feel about the plot and game story in general.  It's pretty unfollowable and mediocre.  It definitely has its shining points, but they are few and far between.  I had heard the hype about this game and was really looking forward to playing it and seeing what it was like.  In reality - I'm exhausted and very happy that I've finally finished it (well - I say finally....but minus the unfollowable, unfindable side quests it only takes about <20hrs to complete all three Acts).  The ending of the game came very suddenly and anticlimactically, and because I was playing on easy difficulty, battling the dragon (Was that Saskia?  I have no idea.....) was just a little side thing to do to get you to the credits.

There was an epilogue with lots of troop movements, people I didn't know, and places I didn't recognize with armies moving through them.  No idea what that was about."
207429,2,"I purchased this when I got my Wii off eBay for a pretty cheap price. Like another reviewer said, you get what you pay for. I find the ""lights"" are not accurate, I can have one lit blue but not be charged, while the one lit red is charged. Sometimes they even turn purple which is even more confusing. The battery life is very poor. I use my Wii primarily to watch Netflix which means I barely use the remotes, but the batteries run out in just a few on/off uses. When my nephews visit they play games on it and always complain that the remotes run out of ""juice"" too soon - they have one at home so they can compare. Needless to say, it's now getting worse as time goes by and I'm off to buy one that actually plugs into the wall, not the USB port. I had no idea it was even a USB one until I recieved it, had I known that I would probably not have bought it at all."
138957,2,"I bought the game from Blizzards web site. I need to tell these to all of you who are looking to make a big purchase;

1) I played a few hours of Diablo 2 back in the day, the game was OK but I was more of a HOMM player so I sticked with turn based games.
2) I am at Diablo (final battle I guess) in four weeks with only playing it casually, (2-4 hours a day, once or twice a week) The game is very short!.
3) The game started out fun, tagging with others was fun, loot was looking promising.

4) I reached Diablo and as of right now I have no idea when will be the next time I will play this game which I paid $65.

To better summarize this game to you, this game feels like a dungeon in World Of Warcraft. Extremely linear, I might have encountered some side quests but didn't even feel it.

One play through should get you 200-300 gamescore points."

125458,2,"I gave the Wii version of the game 5 stars but sadly the portable version of GBs doesn't live up to its older brothers on the Wii (nor the 360 and PS3 for that matter).

The play is starkly different as you lead the Ghostbusters as a group of four as opposed to the console version's new recruit. The game tries to play itself off as more of an action RPG, but generally fails. You will be entertained when it starts, leading your team with the stylus through levels like the Sedgwick Hotel. Trapping ghost is simple enough as you spray them with your beam until they stop moving. Then with a press L and a tap of the stylus, your trap is released and the ghost is captured.

Where GBDS fails is in the ability to make this process entertaining in the long term. In the station, you can research new technologies as well as make new products. The problem is, for the most part, these items are superfluous. Early in the game your team will be able to easily overpower most Ghosts. The same is true of the leveling system which offers lots of option, but little real effect to the game.

Missions are divided into story missions and side missions. All missions start with you driving to one of the 6 or 7 locations in the lousy representation of New York put up for you. This appears to be here just to extend the game. The driving controls are awful and driving in the city is boring. You can catch roaming ghosts with a car top blaster, but usually the ghost isn't near your destination. Since you are under a time limit to get to each mission start, you generally will never fight the ghosts. You can also fight them in a free drive mode, but again, it is so painfully boring to drive, there is no incentive to do it.

Side missions are atrocious. Either you have to catch all ghost, close all portals, save a few people or collect artifacts. Same 4 missions, same 5 or so locations. Uggghhh. Making it worse is the fact that many of the capture all ghost missions will only involve one ghost. Spend two minutes driving, fight ghost for 8 seconds, back to firehouse. Yeeessshhhh.

Story missions fare better with more enemies and more complex locations. However, the game can get bogged down in some fairly obtuse puzzles and an annoying habit of making certain characters look at certain things. If the wires are broken, Winston has to look at it, if it is a book, it has to be Ray, if it is scientific, it is Egon etc etc. Boss battles are sadly not much different than fighting regular ghosts for the most part. One entertaining exception of destroying a T-day float stands out however.

The story is basically incomprehensible if you haven't played the console versions. With no voice acting, the experience loses quite a bit.

You will probably start out having fun with GBDS, but long before it is over, you will be bored to tears. Take a pass and get the console versions."
363969,2,"This game has to many problems. The load times are to long,the check points are far and you have to fight everything again when you die. The weapon upgrades are also bad. And anytime you want to get new stuff you have go through like three load times. The game is hard and you die a lot so whats fun about that. People with out a life will love the game but video games are suppose to be fun, this is not. Save your money and wait for witcher or a game that is worth your money. Unless you want to play the same level over an over again."
408335,2,"Unbeknownst to me before purchasing this, each 'race' is basically a twenty to thirty second little sprint, which has to be executed close to perfect in order to obtain gold medal timing.  This amounts to endless ten-second sprints followed by instant restarts, as you invariably struggle to flawlessly execute every twist & turn as required by the game.  It should be telling that there are three controls used almost equally throughout the game - steering, accelerator, and restart level.

It would be a lot more palatable if so many of the tracks didn't require greater steering precision than the standard Xbox One Wireless controllers provide.  There are many times where you have to steer very precisely through narrow openings, requiring very tiny adjustments to course.  That's not easy, however, because the joysticks on the Xbox One Wireless controllers (as with all such controllers I've ever used) have a little bit of slack around their neutral positions, during which they won't actually register an input.  The minimum deflection they actually register results in too much steering, in many cases.  This leads to 'digital' steering where you repeatedly give little love-taps to the joysticks to try to approximate the small adjustment you want.  Which might be a subjective thing, but I at least find that exceedingly tedious & tiring."
161402,2,"I simply didn't enjoy this game, and I've gone back and tried it with new updates (since I got it on Steam I own it forever). The controls are jerky and awkward, the aiming sucks...the car physics are horrendous. The characters do not interest me. The visual style strikes me as childish.

I really just can't find anything that I enjoy about this game. It felt like a Fisher Price version of a Grand Theft Auto game.

Yes, there is a high degree of customizability of the characters and cars, and there is a lot of freedom of movement, etc. The problem is...even with all that freedom, it still just feels cheap.

No thanks."
14092,2,"This is one of the best looking games on the system with brilliantly detailed graphics, high speed, and nice parallax scrolling. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't hold up very well. This game is brutally and unfairly difficult. It is a side scrolling beat' em up similar to Double Dragon or Final Fight, though nowhere near as good as the ladder. The moves all work and some are quite funny to watch. However where the difficulty comes in is in two player. This is often considered to be almost unplayable, as there is one huge, unavoidable flaw- Friendly fire. Yes, you can actually damage your teammates. If you aren't careful then this could entirely break the game. While the graphics are nice and the control works, the difficulty alone and the broken nature of two-player mode make this one of my least favorite of the Rare's NES offerings."
429725,2,"Game is ok, I take some issue with the mechanics - particularly with the crafting and hunting systems. Wild animals are nowhere near where the map tells you they are. Also, combat is supposed to be the draw for this game, but I found it tedious and repetitive - not challenging or fun."

162419,2,"I really wish I'd had some way of reading the Terms of Service before buying this game.  Instead I didn't get around to reading it until after I'd installed the game and was waiting for three hours to play it.

In a nut shell, the TOS clearly states that you are not buying the ability to play this game.  In my case I paid for a physical DVD, an instruction manual, a notepad, and a pretty box.  That is it.  Blizzard is very clear in the TOS that just because you bought this game doesn't mean you paid for the right to play it.

That is worrying on many many levels, and takes the whole Amazon/iTunes concept of ""You don't own your digital content you just rent it"" a little bit too far for my taste.  Amazon and Apple have at least shown ""good cause"" when they've been forced by legal action to pull things you paid for from your library, Blizzard takes it to a whole new level and says that at any time (and for any reason) they can prevent you from playing this game.  Servers are full?  Too bad.  Server crashed? Too bad. You were in the middle of a boss fight when it happened? Sucks to be you.

I could understand this, I really could if this was World of Warcraft or any other game that is a MMORPG.  Diablo III isn't.  It's a single player (which Blizzard is now calling solo) game with the option to play online with friends. Sadly as an insular myopic loner, I have no friends and as such I have no desire to play Diablo III with them.  And yet, I can't play the game if the servers are down, full, or if Blizzard is having an otherwise bad day.

The simplest solution is to play on other servers in other regions.  Which sounds nice, but is TOS violation and prevents you from getting any sort continuity for your character.  I've got a Demon Hunter on Americas, a Barbarian on Europe, and a Witch Doctor in Asia, and only the barbarian has been stable enough to play to level 10.

Which is too bad, because chucking jars of spiders at the undead while your own zombie dogs chew on their faces never gets old. And neither does rapid fire with a flaming bow.

But enough of the server problems, the random ""going going gone"" mindset of Blizzard.

The game itself, when playable is fun.  It's not awesome.  It's not even great.  But it is fun. So far its Diablo II with upgraded graphics (which aren't mind blowing either, just good...maybe great for three years ago but my todays standard, just good), tweaked gameplay (which you are either going to despise, or be like me and be indifferent too), with lots of play space.  Which would be cool, if the game wasn't so liner.  The maps and world is huge, but most of its rather pointless because of all the places you can go, explore, and slaughter things in are mostly incidental to the story and the advancement of your character and the story.

Well, at least so far.  If I can get on and actually play the game for more than half an hour at a time, I'll let you know if that changes.

Edited: Well it's been two weeks now and I feel the need to provide an update.

The game is a twenty minute game, meaning I can play it for about twenty minutes before I'm bored with the click move shift click destroy things.  Which is good, because after twenty minutes of play the lag has become so annoying that the game is unplayable.  It's ironic, the lag...for a single/solo player game...is so bad the game can't be played as a single player game.

Ofcourse it wouldn't be irony if it weren't that the majority of the very features that require the game to be online, auction house (both the in game gold and the real world money) and multiplayer grouping are once again offline (the auction house has been down for three or four days).

So even if I wanted too take advantage of the very features that are killing the single player experience...I can't.

Awesome.  But not the good kind of awesome."
192236,2,Too expensive. Dumb.
470349,2,"I enjoy the martial arts, and I thought this game had a decent approach - learn martial arts skills without violence.  It's not a very good game though.

The game is basically broken up into 6 minigames, with slight restrictions based on what particular form of a game you're playing.  For instance, in the first Koi game, you catch as many fish as you can.  in the second, you need to catch one particular fish.  In the third, you catch fish as they swim across the screen.  So on and so forth.  For every belt rank, you need to recomplete each of these games at a slightly harder difficulty level, and then again during your belt test.  All of these are incredibly easy (with the exception of the Katana games, which I find are very unresponsive to the wiimote), even for me, a really out-of-practice video gamer.  I ended up as a blue belt (about 2/3 of the way to black belt) in less than an hour.

It has some interesting options, like the naming system, and the meditation system which expects you to actually go along with what Sensei is saying via guided meditation, or just a simple soothing music background while you go it alone.  It's completely optional, but it is a pretty unique feature.

Overall, once you spend about 2 hours, you'll start to wonder when you'll find something new.  Unfortunately, you'll have almost the entire thing unlocked in about 45 minutes.  That really puts a damper on the gameplay."

115730,2,"The jury is in, and Microsoft loses. Sorry but after owning an XBox 360 for over 6 months, and a PS3 for less time, I have decided that the XBox 360 is the inferior product. I don't play games on the console that often, preferring the PC for most shooters. However, because of console only titles, I bought this system. Despite the light usage the XBox 360 finally died with the famous ""3 Rings of death"" red lights. I sent it in for repairs (which were at least under warranty) and despite the fact that Microsoft said it would be fixed or replaced in 2 business days they had it for over a week before sending it back.

The other BIG downside to the XBox 360 is the noise factor. With the DVD drive going the system makes so much racket I can hear it over the games I am playing. Considering that one game is Nascar '08, that is saying quite a lot. No way I would ever use the XBox 360 for watching movies. Now that Blu-ray has won the High Def DVD wars, I bought a PS3 and was pleasantly surprised that the unit makes almost no noise, even while playing movies. Sony knows how to make hardware.

If it weren't for Mass Effect, I would have sold the machine long ago. While I have heard the Elite version is more quiet and has fixed the problems of overheating, I can't convince myself to give Microsoft any more money after this horrible experience."
32370,2,"""KAIN'S BACK FROM THE DEAD...AND THIS TIME, HE'S BORING AS ...AND LOVING IT!""
Despite having a gripping, dark tale to work with, and superb graphics to match, this game sequel is just too pain-stakingly slow and poorly paced for effective and fun gameplay.  Here's some PROS and CONS, and, unfortunately, the CONS win:
PROS:
>>> Dark, creepy tale --- fun to jump into this world, if just for a short while.
>>> Good graphics, voice-overs, and music.  Kain's jump and glide move is a cool way to cruise around town.  Also, the side-kick vampire chick is a hottie.
CONS:
>>> Slow, slow, slow.  I'm ready to play, but have to wait through seemingly endless hours of painful dialogue.
>>> Awkward fighting.  I know this Kain guy can tear some action up, can leap 20 feet into the air, can suck blood, and vanish into the mist, etc. --- but he fights like a total ..., with a big, ""...here it comes, I'm about to hit you with my claw, look out, ready...""  One would hope he'd be a little more coordinated.  ""...wait, I'm turning around, wait, hold on, I, just, I...""
RECOMMENDATION:  All in all, solid package, but not paced quickly enough to keep my interest --- finally, when the fighting does begin, it's just a little too awkward, and sucking blood out of these corpses tends to get old after the 23rd time.  Rent first, then buy."
72343,2,"This game is nothing compared to CoD, very behind the curve on graphics and action. Anything with the Valve name on it, I am skeptical like Team Fortress, suffers from the same issues."
352995,2,Packaging was all good no issues there. The game itself is what i didn't really care for. I expected better
272623,2,"I was extremely excited when I heard about this game, and the more reviews I read, the better it sounded. I finally received the game a few days ago, and honestly, I have just been very disappointed.

As far as game-play, the actual battling reminds me of mystery dungeon games, all of which I loved, except with a few annoying/interesting (depending on the map) terrain effects, and the already heavily beaten to death lack of move variety.

For example, the teleporting pads on the psychic map can get extremely annoying if you lack flying types, (which up to that point in the game I think carnivine was the only one). On the other hand, some maps such as the Dragnor map force you to consider each move carefully, otherwise you may end up with a nasty amount of damage/status, which made that map more fun.

Next, the leveling system, which was just terrible in my opinion. It took me almost half the main plot for me to completely understand it, and even then I did not understand some very bizarre caps that they placed on things. For example, one warrior had dragon/flying types as his specialty, so naturally, seeing that I hadn't seen any other dragon/flying types up to that point in the game (having battled Nabunaga once), I assumed he would at least be gold compatible(If not perfect) with the dragonite evolutions, which OK, considering the number of dragon/flying types in the real games, I could accept he wasn't perfectly compatible. Somehow however he was capped at only silver(70%). Other bizarre warrior specialties included dragon/grass, psychic/dragon, etc. In addition to that, I still cannot figure out why, even though dragon is the last type you obtain in the story, a good 20% of warriors specialize in that, and don't even get me started on fighting specialties...

While I personally hated the move selections, I can accept and sort of understand why they made it that way. Within the game, every pokemon was limited to one move, pre-determined by the game. For example eevee knew quick attack, or dragonair knew dragon tail. I guess they wanted each pokemon to be associated with a type(kingdom), rather than which pokemon is the best or any other concerns like move pool. Although this made multi-type pokemon very awkward, like gabite could only use dragon claw. My biggest complaint with this was that they could have made strategic moves like stealth rock or spikes very interesting, for example, placing it at narrow intersection. There is such a diverse amount of non-combat moves and hell, even combat moves, that were completely overlooked in the game.

In your actual kingdom managing, I tried all 3 options, although out of the 3 the only one I found useful was training. The problem with search was that the pokemon/people found tended to have terrible link caps (see above), and were generally pokemon already found. As far as the third one, I still don't know what it does exactly, I had several kingdoms on it for the entire game, and I saw no change whatsoever in my character or those kingdoms. It was an interesting concept to have kingdoms and such, but since it was the first game in the series I think they will likely expand on it in a sequel, which considering this game's popularity right now is almost certain.

Finally the story line, which I'm only going to cover the main story. The story line is simple enough, conquer a lot of type-themed *cough*gyms*cough*, I mean kingdoms, face a series of still type-themed endgame harder trainers that work under the final boss*cough*elite four*cough*, then finally the champion, oops I meant Nabunaga. Admittedly they do add a little bit of plot after that, and a few other plot twists, but in general the plot was a more linear version of the main games (No side-plots like team rocket or plasma or magma, etc). There is a lot more personality in the characters in these games than in the main series, like facial expressions and the main character actually talks.

Overall, if you are a hardcore pokemon fan, you will definitely want to at least try this game, but personally, I think reviews so far have been too kind to it. As I said so far, there was a lot of things I think they could have implemented better, like for example allowing a non-attacking move of your pokemon's type, but I still think it is probably worth a playthrough.

*endreview*

I'm sure a lot of fans will now go after me for making a 2 star review. By all means go ahead, I don't support every game a franchise makes just because I like the franchise, and I hope those of you that do respond actually look at the game as something other than a fanboy. I hated skyward sword because of the bad controls even though I love the Zelda franchise, for example."

4247,2,"With a form-factor nearly identical to the original PlayStation  controllers (but minus the analog sticks of the ""Dual Shock""  controller), this controller's obvious benefit is to owners of  ""Connectix Virtual Game Station"", the PlayStaiton-on-Macintosh  emulator.  It's also handy for arcade-y titles and MacMAME, the emulator of  classic arcade video games.
The one place Gravis makes a change is very  much for the worse -- the four separate directional buttons are replaced by  a single pivoting directional-pad.  As too often happens with designs like  this, the D-pad pushes two switches at once, and ALWAYS comes through as a  diagonal (eg, right + up, when you thought you were just pushing right).  The frequent inability to enter a true right, left, up, or down is annoying  in some games, particularly in navigating the menus of an RPG, and deadly  in others (PSX ""Asteroids"" is unplayable when rotating your ship  sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace, since that's what  ""up"" does).
Also of note is the fact that this controller works  only with games written to use Apple's ""InputSprockets"".  That's  true of most late 90's / early 2000's games, but not of some earlier titles  (""Descent"", which used to be bundled with Mac Performas, comes to  mind), and it's not clear if Sprockets will be supported in the upcoming  Mac OS X.
That said, driver installation is easy and has been hassle-free  on my two iMacs and my iBook.  USB plug-and-play almost always works  without a snap, though I've found it's better to plug it in once the Finder  is up instead of during the boot cycle.
If you play lots of Mac games  (and by the way... HOW?!), this is better than relying on mouse/keyboard  alone, but the D-pad problems are a major aggrivation."
393415,2,"Update months later: I usually love DreamGEAR stuff, but there is one big bad flaw with this one. There is no hole to insert the game cartridges. When my son needs to change games, he has to pull off the left silicon handle. Sadly, when he does this, it pulls off the back cover of the DS. It was happening so much, that the back cover has gotten very weak and doesn't hold onto the DS like it did when we first purchased the game system. So, yeah, this case caused damage to my DS because of the need to remove that part of the case to put in and take out cartridges.

We tried cutting a hole out to easily put in cartridges, but now the case just looks like something from the junk yard.

We ended up throwing his case in the junk pile and we purchased a plastic type case that has all the holes cut where they need to be.

I can't recommend it, if you have cartridges. If you only download games from the DS Store, then the case makes it easy to hold the DS.

245426,2,"I first bought GTA-5 for PS3 the day it was released. My PS3 was very old at the time, it was a 1st generation PS3 bought the day PS3 was released. The game was a little buggy, it was overheating the PS3. Within a couple weeks my PS3 fried and wouldn't turn on. I ended up getting rid of everything PS3 related. I still had Xbox 360 but I didn't buy a replacement GTA-5 until last week.

Unlike my PS3 my Xbox 360 was not as old, it was probably 3rd generation or s Xbox 360 (Had the HDMI output built in) so I was expecting a better experience. I could not have been more wrong. During the install of the game when it said to inset disc 2, it wouldn't recognize disc 2 was in. Disc 2 was in perfect shape but it kept saying incorrect disc.

I had to reboot the system, then it finally started. During the tutorial however it would not work to change characters. Couldn't get passed this part of the tutorial because it wouldn't change characters. Luckily after 5 failed tries or so it gives you the option of skipping it.

Once I finally got to the real game the controls felt horrible compared to the PS3 version. Worse after playing not that long it froze up on me. I shut it off in disgust- no idea if it even saved my place. Console games aren't supposed to be this buggy.

Also- since this game wasn't bought during the initial launch you can't get the Atomic Blimp. There was on YouTube a way you used to be able to get the blimp if you had a helicopter and could land on the blimp and jump in but the game makers WENT OUT OF THERE WAY to stop that from being allowed to happen. WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS? Punishment for people who didn't buy early? It wasn't nearly as easy as it was for people who did buy early but at least it was something if you really wanted to use the blimp.

I will never buy another game from these people. Don't waste your money on this."

I have tried all the tips, it just doesn't work. They rarely die if at all. Legit, you can kick ass and hit them all you want but they don't die. This is in the beginning of the game... Who knows how much more difficult it will get as the game goes on. I haven't even left the opening level."
56427,2,"""Rainbow Six 3:Black Arrow"" is just a bigger version of the original. But the Online Multiplayer has bigger maps and a new gun. The story isn't bad, considering that it's a First-Person Shooter. The A.I. is a little bit smarter, but thats not saying much, plus there's only ONE new gun. And whats the point in having Retrievel in a Squad Based Tactical game. It gets really stupid, and there really is no point in making this game. Say what you want, ""Black Arrow"" isn't that great to me. I realized that it's just like the original, just bigger. ""Halo 2"" may have the same problem, but people want ""Halo 2"" to be alot like ""Halo"", just a little bit bigger."
191767,2,"It's a spinoff video game as part of the Guitar Hero series of music rhythm games, released by Activision (attributed with killing the series). The game is structurally similar to Guitar Hero 5, and supports full band play (lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals).  Virtual avatars of Taylor Swift, Adam Levine (the bad), and the band No Doubt are presented in the game.  An appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero for the ""Top 40"" pop rock hits, the game is strictly aimed at teenagers.

74478,2,"I have had my XBox 360 for over 2 years and like most people I have back ground noise in my house that is undesirable to the rest of the world (barking dog, barking wife and kids, etc).  The older version of the headset had the mute switch located on your hand controller and could be switched with no effort at all - seriously, simpler than hitting the ""X"" button.  Anyway, now Microsoft fixes the previous headset and locates the mute switch some 12"" from the controller somewhere near my adams apple or whatever - not sure the brilliance with this or how this was supposed to help the gaming experience, guess I am not as smart as the richest man in the world.  Anyhow, so with the unit I now leave my mike muted all the time as I don't have time in most games to hunt for the switch dangling from my earpiece.

175983,2,"I thought this would be cute because I love cats. Yet all your doing is the same thing over and over again. Feeding,petting and dressing your pet. Also there are places that are locked like the beach and mountains and so far I can't open them."
55042,2,"I was going to write something clever like ""One word review:  Uninstall.""  But that's not really fair, so here's what I really think.  And I should preface this by saying that I do tend to be turned off by games that are rough around the edges.  Glitchy UI etc. will frustrate me and eventually I'll stop playing - that's just me.  So having read other reviews, I probably should have known better than to take my chances with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

Anyway... There's a lot to like here but its mainly in the way of recognizing what the game is trying to be, rather than what it actually is.

As far as what actually works, the sense of vulnerability in a wide-open hostile environment with LOTS of enemies and realistically fallible weapons... it's great, and probably what's earning the (undeserved?) 8/10 ""official"" ratings everywhere.  This much starts out a little frustrating, but grows on you as you catch the learning curve.  There's a real challenge here that blends action and strategy very well.

But that's about all that works.  The visuals are pretty lame on my (2G, Athlon 3800, NVidia 6800-based) system because dynamic lighting is out of the question.  Anything other than static lighting yields frame rates down around 1 FPS.  (That's not a typo.)  Sound is sometimes effective, but mix and positioning are often confused, ie. is that ground cover shuffling under my feet or machine gun fire in the distance?  Who knows?

The rest is really, really broken.  And I'm sure some of it works in some measure because a lot of people are toughing it out and really enjoying themselves.  And that's great.  But if there's a core story line that makes sense for the very patient, it is absolutely BURIED in content that makes no sense whatsoever.  I would write this off as bad translation/localisation, but it is not merely that the dialog is hard to comprehend.  It's also that missions begin and end (fail, more often than not) with no apparent reason.  When there is an apparent reason - ie. an NPC is completely incompetent - it's every bit as frustrating.  The PDA and especially the map are very non-intuitive to navigate. (Maybe it works, but not as I'd expect... not even the 2nd or 3rd way I'd expect.)  I could go on and on.

The final deal-breaker for me was the dreaded inventory page.  The game is challenging, so you'll hate to leave valuables (namely, ammo and the weapons to deliver it) behind.  But you will be forever burdened and wondering what to keep, what you can afford to leave behind.  The inventory screen that pops up when you loot a corpse is marginally different than the standard one (not so much that you won't constantly forget) and it somehow makes the process of looting a corpse and unloading the precious bullets from his weapon and then unburdening yourself so you can actually, ahem... walk... very, very tedious (and frequently deadly.)

But maybe that's OK since most other loot is useless.  Artifacts offer ""tradeoffs"" that can consistently be reduced to:  using this item will improve armor slightly but also kill you slowly.  Hmm, trick question?  And saving things for resale is also pointless since, as many have bemoaned, the game's ""economy"" is non-existent.  There are few vendors with nearly nothing of interest, and currency is mostly a non-concern.

Others have complained that the faction system is broken, that the game and the NPCs do not react any differently based on your interactions with others.  I can't confirm or deny because I'm never sure who's friend or foe until the first shot has been fired.  At me.  And that's every bit as much fun as it sounds.  And then, sometimes, I'm still not sure.

Sigh.  I really wanted to like this game.  I already spent the money, already wasted a weekend, and on top of all of that, it's a very cool concept.  But there's more bad than good here, plain as that.  This game didn't leave me feeling like a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. so much as a S.U...  You get the idea."
152359,2,"I bought this strictly for the Sega side. I have yet to try the NES part.
The video has a subtle wavy pattern to it.

It doesn't show up so much on a small analog TV, but if you plug it into
a newer digital TV, it gets wavy. My original Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 don't
have the wavy issues.

Also the sound is just plain horrible. It crackles like a cheap stereo. I have tried
this system on several TVs and always the same thing.

I didn't think NHL 94 beats could get worse, but on this system it hurts your ears.

I did like the controllers. We have a lot of NHL 94 tourneys and everyone likes
to play with these controllers. These controllers will not fit the regular Sega.
They shaped them differently."
176752,2,"Bought these shortly after Christmas, and upon reading of the horrors of setting them up I found out myself just how heinous a process it is. Even after fighting for over a half-hour for the clamps that hold the cymbal posts to the drum kit to ""JUST...SNAP...JUST...SNAP..C'MONNNNNNNN SNAAAP!! GAAAUGH! %&#@!"" with and without powertools (one of which never fully did snap 100% together), they worked beautifully, truly adding a new dimension and surprisingly seemed to make drumming a little easier for this non-musician to do-it-up more like a real one. Infatuated, I played for hours everyday for about a week straight before getting distracted from playing for that entire next week after.

The start of having these cymbals for that third week... was every optimistic-cynic's nightmare. Having known about the terrible setup, and still choosing to trudge on. Then experiencing the setup, and still going forward from that. Then experiencing a blissful 7-days of newfound drumming glory... to suddenly having DOUBLE-HIT!??

For no obvious, apparent, or investigative reason, my cymbals started double hitting any moderately-hard hit they registered. Which, if you do your homework, a lot of the disgruntled reports over these cymbals are about. If you just want to play and don't care about your score (and your score multiplier) then you won't care that this seems to be an unfixable and common problem with these.

But I, for one, also am now hanging my head low in mourning of what-was for a beautiful 7-day stretch, and what-could've been with properly designed cymbal accessories.

[PS.  Also, feel free to assume that it's just me and my cymbal pack (and dozens of others out there) and trudge onward with your purchase! Best of luck to you, honestly, because they're sadly a great addition.]

***EDIT #2: Originally I had posted an edit about how I attempted to take mine apart and found that it was missing necessary wiring so that it could never be fixed, well apparently those first few pages I found about fixing these cymbals were wrong, or else I just didn't know exactly what to look for in the guts of my broken cymbal that kept double-tapping in-game. After peeling off and realigning the wire and ""stickum"" to the proper place that they weren't in the first place to where they belonged, this double-cymbal pack only gave me problems with how the vice grip holders that wouldn't ""SNAP!"" would eventually drop my cymbal posts and I'd have to pause mid-song to readjust them--but this was very rarely, or only after extended disuse.

IN CONCLUSION: Since the pricedrop on this pack as well as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-Band-2-Triple-Cymbal-Expansion-Kit/dp/B001G57Y02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock Band 2 Triple Cymbal Expansion Kit</a>&nbsp;went into affect in late 2009, I had upgraded to the Triple set and I must say that the apparatus-es (apparati?) that hold the Triple set together seem so much more cooperative that even though I'm having a much more difficult time adjusting to now having an extra cymbal, I might've bought them again solely for the more-cooperative cymbal posts clamps/clips--it really is THAT much better of an experience with the Triples."
398351,2,"I'm not going to sugar-coat this.  I spent practically the first 3-4 hours of Witcher 3 listening to story, which is ok at first, because the story is in fact exceptionally good and the characters have a lot of personality, but when you sit in a chair that long, doing pretty much nothing, and then get thrown into a situation that requires a huge amount of micromanagement, it feels kind of awkward.  I'm obviously referring to the fight with the griffin.  I think what got me more frustrated though was the fact that Geralt's character felt extremely janky.  Passive actions such as dodging and jumping are pretty unresponsive, and died numerous times due to those alone.  Then, using offensive actions like the crossbow and performing signs (spells), all felt extremely rugged as well and made me feel like I was trying to compensate for something; not to mention Geralt looked like human robot while doing them.

Lastly, and this is the part that turns me off of games like this, the mission structure is bloated, and I mean... BLOATED!
* Geralt goes looking for Yennefer
* Geralt stumbles upon a man that thinks Yennefer might be at an inn
* Geralt goes to the inn, and talks to everybody
* A guy at the inn tells Geralt that he might know the whereabouts of Yennefer
* Geralt goes to a settlement that the guy suggested
* Geralt talks to the settlement's head honcho
* Head Honcho wants Geralt to kill a griffin before he spills beans about Yennefer
* Geralt goes to a small-time hunter to get help killing the griffin
* Hunter needs a little help killing some wolves
* Geralt and Hunter investigate the griffin's nest
* Hunter eventually gives Geralt the bait for the griffin
* Geralt goes back to the inn to get his BFF
* Geralt and friend set up camp, waiting for griffin to take bait
* Griffin comes, shoddy gameplay starts

Get the drift?

I realize that a lot of this sounds like petty crap, and I have admit, I'm not a huge fan of gamey RPGs anyway, but the experience overall was unrewarding to me.  I suppose I was hoping to get a game like Skyrim, a game of glorious proportions that had solid gameplay; simple enough for anyone to catch on, but had layers of depth for those who want to sink their teeth in.  Skyrim also had greatly told stories hidden throughout the world, in each dungeon, and in each side quest, that somehow felt like real people have those experiences.  Most importantly, the game didn't force you to spend 4 hours listening to bull crap before you get to the meat of the experience.  If I wanted to watch a movie, I'd watch the The Witcher: Wild Hunt (The Movie), and it'd probably be pretty good.  After all, I would like to see how it ends.  I did the right thing though, returned the game to Gamestop, pre-ordered Arkham Knight and haven't regretted it since then.  I know I'm probably one of very few people that didn't enjoy the game, and although I've bashed it quite a bit by now, I have to give a little respect to CD Project Red on how they treated their product.  The fact that I got a rather endearing thank-you letter tucked into the box, along with an incredible soundtrack CD, says a lot for its developer.  They're obviously nice people and they know how to put together a good story.  Maybe Cyberpunk will pull me back in.  ;)"
423096,2,"Far Cry Primal is a decent extension of the Far Cry franchise to new territories however I think it falls short on many levels. The game feels more like it should be called 10000 BCE which is more accurate than saying primal. I say this because its basically a new IP with just the Far Cry name on it to try to get more people interested. Instead of having shooting elements and weapons and such everything is just reskinned as a bow and arrow, club,  with some other non original items for the period. That isn't to really ding it but it is to say it is not really a refreshing experience. I also think  the decision to go to this territory could have been a bit better if they left the ""far cry"" name. Far Cry at least has some cinematic storytelling to it, this does too but again its been reskinned for the period and unfortunately kind of done in an awkward manner. I think having them speak english would have made for a better game than going for a period based original language. I just can't connect with them.

In any case the game struggles to remain interesting after its first hour. It feels like the traditional tried and true Ubisoft action adventure open world experience fully with the capture the zone type of missions, clear out the baddies and get the zone, do things to recruit more allys, etc. So really there is nothing truly refreshing with the gameplay, there is even a special *vision* that enables you to find hints and clues in the environment. I think the crafting system is probably the most interesting thing going on but it ties too much into the find the ally so you can clear this one requirement to allow you to craft a better item thing. Its kind of annoying. I kind of wish it was more free and recipe RPG driven where you can generate stuff as long as you have the items on hand.

So overall this is a decent game however it leaves much to be desired. When comparing it to the other games in the Ubisoft portfolio it feels right in line with what they do. When comparing it with others games on PS4, its kind of lacking compared to say Infamous Second Sun or rpgs like Dragon Age Inquisition."
234193,2,"The basic premise here is the same as ACII and AC Brotherhood, you're mostly playing as Ezio, sometimes Desmond, and sometimes Altair in this one. As a standalone game, it's solid, but for where it falls in the line of AC games, it's a disappointment.

The longer I play AC Revelations, the clearer it is they should have introduced a new main character in a new century for this game. After the huge improvements in ACII and AC Brotherhood, this game is a definite step back in gameplay and in story.

Firstly, they committed a common mistake when improving graphics: Ezio looks nothing like himself from the past games. I get that his face is more detailed and he's old, but that shouldn't prevent him from looking like the same person. They over-aged him and changed his beard and his hair. You lose your attachment to the character because he no longer looks like Ezio, he looks like some Muslim dude with Ezio's voice. You might be able to get beyond that since you have a follow-cam view of him most of the time, except that you'll be reminded about once every 30 seconds that he's old now. Random people say it, they mention it in a bunch of cinematics...it's jammed into most of the dialogue about the game. If you hated how they did a Metal Gear game with old man Snake where they NEVER SHUT UP about how he's old, you'll hate this, too. Don't give me the old man protagonist who is sometimes supposed to be limited by his age and other times able to do all the things the 24 year old character did. It doesn't make any sense. Turn him into an NPC sage figure and introduce a new main character to make the transition.

The story is not interesting at all through about 1/4 of the game. I'm sitting around 20-25% sync and there's nothing at stake, all the characters are brand new and there's no reason to care if they live or die. There's no villain established. It's just the templars...you know, in general. Ezio's just running around Constantinople looking for some keys (GOLLY, do ya think he'll find them?!?) to get into Altair's library. They introduced some Italian woman, and so far all they do is talk about books. I have zero attachment to any of the characters. After the way they George R.R. Martin you in Brotherhood by starting off blowing up the town you spent all AC II building, killing your uncle, moving the family to Rome, and then gradually unlocking the Christina memories only to (spoiler alert) kill her off, it's REALLY boring to be starting this game with a bunch of strangers you just met and have no attachment to.

They took the idea of renovating shops from AC Brotherhood and thought, ""Hey how can we make this so it's not fun? I know! What if it's +25% notoriety every time you renovate something?"" Almost all the map is immediately open instead of having to be unlocked, so all you do for 3 days is run around buying shops, then bribing heralds and killing officials to get your notoriety back down. Why not play missions? Because you don't care enough about the story to start the next memory, you don't have to advance memories to unlock new areas, and you need money.

How else is the gameplay worse? How about changing around a couple buttons for no reason at all? Nothing makes me want to ball-kick a game developer more than when they take a button that did the same action for 3 games and change it. Games 1-3, press triangle to talk to somebody. Game 4? Press triangle to shoot or throw a bomb! That should in no way blow a few 100% syncs for you! There, now just talk to this guy and you're all set WHOOPS you threw a bomb in the middle of town and now guards are all over you! Know how triangle did eagle vision in every other game? L3 now, for no reason at all. ""I really wish pressing down on the joystick did something,"" said no gamer ever.

Sometimes guards recognize and attack you for no reason, even when you're anonymous. That's a bug they could have fixed, but I bought this used years later and downloaded the patch at install...they're leaving it like that I guess.

They've added a second weapon wheel so they can confuse you and needlessly add bombs to the game. Have fun getting used to that and accidentally dropping a bomb on yourself when you're trying to shoot a guard. There are way too many kinds of bombs, you'll only ever need 2, but you'll spend lots of time learning the overly-complicated way to make jillions of combinations of them from sets of ingredients. Oh and you need a special table only found in certain places to make them. Because, you know, can't make bombs without tables that fold down from the wall. Everyone knows that.

The new hookblade is kinda cool, because it lets you zipline (good addition), but it's annoying and inconsistent to use when climbing. The climbing was fine in previous games, why'd you need to jerk with it? Sometimes it works perfectly and you climb really fast. Other times, you accidentally wall-jump backwards to your death. What's the difference? We don't know, and that's why it's exciting!

You can't tackle people any more, you leg sweep them with the hookblade, beacuse that's somehow necessary. Other hookblade stuff is cool, if unnecessary. You can use it to swing for long jumps (which could 100% be done without a hook) and to do hook slams or hook-and-run, which I also don't see the need for, but are kinda visually cool. Basically they wanted ziplines and had to add this hook for that, then they did a bunch of other crap with it to justify its existence.

Den defense is just stupid. We were teetering on the brink of too complicated with the assassin recruits in the last game, and we went well over the edge on this one. The animation on it is awful, the controls are weird, and it's all the fun of having to kill a bunch of templars without ACTUALLY getting to be the one who kills any of the templars. All you do is set up units and roadblocks, it's somehow logistically overcomplicated to do while being uninteresting in terms of graphics and gameplay.

Then we get to Desmond. Having killed Lucy off, you're fresh out of reasons to care about him, because the only thing that made him interesting was wanting to find out if he was gonna get in her jeans or not. He's stuck in the animus for some reason because he's losing his mind or something. So to remedy this you collect data fragments from within Ezio's world and spend them to access locked memories. This will somehow fix the partitions of Desmond's mind. ""Oh cool, I thought, good solution for how it didn't matter if you got the feathers and flags before. Now I have a reason to care about finding these."" Surprise! You spend them to unlock the WORST CRAP I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY GAME.

You have to play these levels that are somehow at once REALLY boring while being a little too difficult. All you do is walk around. Not climb, not swing from cool stuff...just walk and hop. Advancing the checkpoints causes Desmond to talk to himself about his really lame childhood, with this really terribly-written script that reads like a crappy play about South Dakota. Through the first two there's no fighting, nobody else there, it doesn't look cool visually, it's like they were trying to create a video game of Tron with nobody else in it and they failed. I'd try to explain it, but it makes no sense.

If this part were its own game, nobody would play it. The only reason you'll play it is because you basically have to. I've done two of them and I already am dreading the third. I didn't think I could hate anything more than those rotating picture puzzles from the previous games, but I've been proven wrong.

Also annoying: Now and then a guy will just run up and stab you in the side and then run away. Once he grabs you, you have a couple seconds to counter before he stabs you. Now...he's grabbing you, so what should you press? LOL NOOOO NOT COUNTER-GRAB! A DIFFERENT BUTTON! It's cool, you'll only get stabbed about 10 times before you get used to how dumb that is. If you kill him, you get like $1,500 which is nice, but otherwise he serves no real purpose other than to piss you off.

Then there's Altair memories. Wouldn't it be cool to unlock extensive Altair memories and missions you could play? He had this long, interesting life after the end of AC, don't you want to play a bunch of that? Well you're not going to. Not through the first 2 memories, anyhow.

You're going to run around Masayaf, the most boring city from AC, and you're going to watch a lot of cutscenes while you think, ""That's not the same guy who voiced Altair in the first game. Well, maybe...I haven't played it in a long time. No, it's the guy who does Ezio, he sounds just like Ezio. Well...maybe...no...is it?"" I'll save you the google, it's not the same guy who voices Ezio, and it's also not the original voice of Altair.

There's room for this one to pick up steam since I'm only 1/4 in, but so far it's a huge disappointment compared to Brotherhood or even to ACII. The gameplay crossed the line into being too complex, and the story is awful so far. The detail is in all the wrong places. I'll finish it because at this point I'm into the franchise and I'll appreciate AC III more if I know the story from Revelations, but this game is a shadow of the previous 2."
474998,2,"I bought Puzzle Hero when it was a buck during a promotion on Amazon. That's a decent price for it, but I'd still much rather play Puzzle Quest, a far superior game of the same ilk which you can download for about the same price as this game right now. Both games have Bejeweled style game play with RPG elements mixed in, though Quest has a story to follow with lots of dialogue, more magic/skills, better graphics, and better sound. I will admit this game does seem to be made for younger kids, so if you're a parent looking for a tamer cutesy option, this would be fine. Even if it gets marked down again, I would still recommend Puzzle Quest over this low budget imitator."
139120,2,"Diablo 3 has been fun, but Mac users beware--while Blizzard says this game is supported for the Mac, any Mac with the Nvidia 9400M video card (which is many Macbooks, including my 2010 13in Macbook Pro) will NOT play the game satisfactorily. Even on the lowest graphic settings the game is too sluggish to play (5-10 FPS). At the beginning of the game this lag seems tolerable when there are only a few monsters on the screen, but as you progress into more advanced acts the game slows down to the point where all you do is die to unseen hordes stuttering around the screen.

This looks like a fun game, but now I've been forced to buy a new computer or ask for a refund--it simply cannot play on Macs with Nvidia 9400M cards! Wait to see if Blizzard fixes this, and the game might be cheaper by then too."
89511,2,"This game is John Woo in every way, style and no substance. Great shooting mechanics but after the Woo factor wears off in the beginning of the game, it gets VERY VERY repetitive.

In the gaming world Turtle Beach has a lot hype and I bought into it, literally. At first they were nice, don't get me wrong the sound quality is amazing for 70 dollar headphones, but... there's build quality too. I think somewhere around the second week the right ear piece snapped off, not pop out of place, but snapped. Luckily I have all weather molding adhesive and that stuff is stronger than plastic apparently. Week later it was the left ear pieces turn. Molding adhesive, BAM, stronger than ever! Seriously, it's called GGLUE, good stuff. About a month later, sound quality drops and I can no longer hear people. I thought maybe the wires were stressed and took the remote apart to see if I could mend it. Nope, nothing wrong, just doesn't work anymore. Did a little reading, apparently a common problem.

240192,2,"The Resident Evil franchise is Capcom's storied survival-horror franchise that spawned a slew of sequels, copy-cat games, and an entire genre when the original Resident Evil was released for the PS1 in 1996. In the days of the PS1, Japanese developers often set the precedent that other developers in the West followed and Resident Evil was no exception. The series established survival-horror as a legitimate genre made up of careful story pacing, limited resources (e.g. ammunition) and careful use of fright elements (aka the ""horror"" element) to weave together a game that masterfully ratcheted up the tension as the player progressed. Fast forward to today and the gaming landscape has changed dramatically. Japanese developers while still relevant have largely taken a backseat to Western development studios and the mega-selling franchises made by the likes of Bethesda Softworks, Activision, 2K Games and more. Where once Capcom set precedent they are now followers chasing the elusive success that few developers dream of achieving. That is where we are today and that helps explain the ""why and where"" of Resident Evil.

--------------------
RE 6 STORY:

I own and have played every numbered Resident Evil game on consoles and have played many of the series spin-off titles such as Resident Evil: Code Veronica, Raccoon City and many others. The original RE and main numbered sequels had a relatively straight forward premise - a series of unexplained events centered on what appeared to be a dilapidated mansion on the outskirts of Raccoon City was the epicenter of what turned out to be experiments by rogue company Umbrella. As the series progressed and grew in popularity the story had to expand to include more locations, characters and events. That brings us to RE6. To put it bluntly the story is a mess. If you're able to follow what's actually happening in RE6 with any frame of reference you're in the minority.

RE6 presents 4 playable story arc's. Each features a main RE character with a partner with the exception of perhaps one. Chris Redfield & Piers; Leon Kennedy & Helena Harper; Sherry Birkin & Jake Muller; and finally (Spoiler ahead) Ada Wong and a partner. Each story is independent of each other and each plays out like it's own RE game. The stories intertwine and characters cross paths at various junctions and in brief moments help each other out. The more story arc's played the better your understanding of the events and motivations of the characters involved.

The main issue here is presentation. Resident Evil and the simple story of a rogue company operating outside of the weapons program run by the government has evolved into multitudes of characters, events, locations, endless variations of the T-virus and so on. What's left is an utter mess and essentially an excuse to run through a game shooting stuff. Capcom has shed most of the survival horror elements in favor of trying to emulate action games in order to appeal to a wider (read: Western) audience. They fail miserably. Where Western developers can generally succeed in delivering some sort of coherent story that makes basic sense Capcom falls on their faces. RE6 is rife with terrible dialogue, poorly voice-acted segments, over-the-top melodrama, non-sequitur's, and classic Japanese nonsensical events.

What this all boils down to is RE6 is a generic action shooter that tells a poor and confusing story in order to move characters from one over-wrought boss fight to the next. There is no pacing, no scares, just action scene after action scene. It's like watching a Michael Bay movie without the close-up, slow-motion shots of Megan Fox. Just explosions and gunfights, with helicopters and some giant monsters and helicopters exploding and more explosions... did I mention the game has explosions?

The best story-arc is Sherry and Jake's simply because it adds a few interesting turns, dials down the explosions, and allows for a bit of dialogue and background change. It is of course capped (like all the other story arc's) with an over-the-top, ""he's not dead yet!"" boss fight.

--------------------
GRAPHICS:

Similar to RE5 in a sense that the graphics engine seems to use a grain filter. Colors are earth tones, and generally dark. A lot of this game takes place outside at night and inside buildings. I would use the term 'adequate' to describe the graphics. They're neither outstanding nor poor.

--------------------
GAMEPLAY:

Again this is very similar to RE5. Capcom received a lot of flak for failing to allow players to move and shoot in RE5. That gulf in technological know-how has finally been cracked by the ace team at Capcom HQ. So thankfully you can shoot and move, albeit awkwardly. There is also a cover system that tries to emulate what other shooters have been doing for years if not decades. Unfortunately it is both awkward and relatively pointless as the controller will put up more of a fight than the enemies anyway. So standing in place and shooting is a perfectly viable tactic.

The inventory system in RE games has always been a point of contention. I felt that Capcom finally got the basics right in RE4. However, because not changing a good thing = a bad thing in the minds of the Capcom development studio an entirely new inventory system has been crafted. Gone are storage containers. Instead you have a ""on-the-fly"" inventory that is in a word, imperfect. Switching weapons is done by using the D-pad 'right' or 'left' buttons. Using the D-Pad 'up or 'down' buttons enables you to use healing items and explosives like grenades or remote bombs. The problem comes in whenever you need to access the deeper inventory. For example to use a green herb you have to stop, open the deeper inventory menu, select your herb, add it to your pill-capsule, exit the deeper inventory, and hit the R2 button to pop one pill at a time that regenerates one box of health. It's insane that this passes for an inventory system. It's awkward and interrupts gameplay more than assisting with it.

QTEs or Quick-Time-Events. Capcom has a fetish for these and the QTE guy at Capcom HQ has really done a number here. This game is rife with QTEs. They're everywhere and used for everything. Boss fights will, after shooting hundreds and thousands of rounds, ultimately come down to a series of QTEs. The terrible vehicle segments (motorcycle, barge (yes barge), and more) are back-to-back-to-back... QTEs. Deaths will come often and cheaply until you memorize the QTE sequence. QTEs have their place in gaming, preferably in a gaming history book under the 'Things Players Hate' chapter. Capcom has really gone over the top here.

--------------------
ONLINE:

I played through the game completely online with a friend (also a RE enthusiast) and we felt equally about this game's shortcomings. Mercenaries mode makes a comeback in RE6.

--------------------
THE GOOD:

(+) Capcom has a perfect example of how not to make another Resident Evil game.
(+) Graphics are adequate, if not a bit too dark.

--------------------
THE BAD:
(-) The gameplay is terrible and needs major work. Shooting and moving is awkward and slow. The cover system is broken.
(-) The story is both confusing and hard to follow. Simplify things and give people a compelling reason to play. We don't need 15 evil-masterminds per game just one really good one will do.
(-) The camera is terrible in many spots giving very awkward viewpoints that will result in many cheap player deaths.
(-) QTE's. Please just stop Capcom.
(-) Waves of unrecognizable enemies. No tension just bullets flying at wave after wave of generic enemies.
(-) Endlessly mutating and resurrecting boss battles.
(-) The inventory system needs to be completely redone (again).
(-) Stop trying to be Gears of War or CoD and slow down the pace of the game and the action needs to be strung along not back-to-back.

--------------------
CONCLUSION:

If ever there was a candidate for a full series reset Resident Evil is the prime candidate. Capcom has demonstrated that they're out of touch with what fans and even what gamers want in a game. If the goal is to appeal to Western gamers and a wider audience then find a Western development studio and have them do a reset on the series. Otherwise return the series to its true roots and stop trying to be Gears of War or another generic shooter. Not recommended except to the most adamant Resident Evil fans."
470445,2,"Ironically, my favorite XBox games of all time are the original Conflict series games... Desert Storm, Global Terror, etc.  I don't know what they were thinking when they made this game.  It takes too many steps backward.

I play strictly single-player.  I like being able to position my players where I want them.  The biggest pain in the butt with this game is that you can position your teammate where you want him, but then he'll saunter off on his own, or, worse yet, run out into the open, right into a hail of bullets.  You can place your teammate at a strategic location to watch your back, and next thing you know, you got killed from behind because your teammate decided to walk off, descend a ladder, and crouch behind a wall somewhere.  It's frustrating as all heck, because you're always switching players in order to regain control over the one that's moving around on his own, so you can put him back where you want him.  I can't believe none of the programmers caught this before the game was released.

It's also a lot easier for the enemy to kill you than it is for you to kill them.  Take three rounds, and you're toast.  But when you're fighting the enemy, unless you nail them square in the head, you may have to unload a lot of ammo to bring them down.

The graphics are fine, the general gameplay is acceptable, but I can't give this game better than two stars."
242983,2,"**WoWInsider asks Ghostcrawler about the decline in 25-man raiding, and how 10-man raids seem to be the only kind now:
WoWInsider: Do you think 25 man raiding has stabilized at all, or is it still in decline? Are you guys working on anything to address that?
Ghostcrawler: I don't know -- overall, I haven't looked at the numbers in awhile -- my hunch would be that it's still in decline honestly, because there aren't a lot of -- it's just entropy, that 25 man guilds collapse into 10 man guilds, and it's really hard for a 10 man guild to decide ""Hey, let's recruit a bunch and become 25!""*

This was my biggest issue with MoP. The raid lockouts for both 10 and 25 are the same, and no one wanted to be in a 25-man guild. There were hundreds (maybe thousands) of guilds on the server I played on when I quit, because all of them were 10-man, and only a handful were 25-man. As I state later in the review, this made joining a guild and creating one almost impossible.**

In Wrath of the Lich King, you had your crazies and your jerks, but at least they didn't take up ninety percent of the WoW population. Since Cataclysm, the playerbase has strongly changed, turned into some globular, filthy black mass of selfishness... kind of like a Sha, but a lot harder to kill.

Like I said, I've played during Wrath of the Lich King, and I loved that expansion. I heard that The Burning Crusade was the best out of all of them, and I believe it, because some of the more amazing tales I've heard about the game involved that expansion. Guilds were massive, raids were actually important, and people relied on one another to get the job done. In WotLK that happened as well, in Cata, not so much, then it just completely vanished in MoP.

For a while, I wasn't sure why this was. The game had improved at least a tiny bit from Cataclysm, but the players just seemed to get worse. I play a wide range of various MMORPGs, and I can say with complete honesty, I have not run into players so hateful, so selfish, and so childlike as I have in MoP WoW, and before I quit the game, it was an epidemic, brought on by TERRIBLE ideas and additions to the world by the developers.

Then I did some thinking (a lot of it), which eventually caused my inevitable unsubscribing. The guilds were too small, and too many of them existed. Every guild I ran into had at most, fifteen people in them. In BC and WotLK that was UNHEARD OF. The reason for that is because the change to raids. Before I start ranting, in my WoW days, I was a hardcore raider. I loved to raid, and I loved to make my guild large enough to take on serious bosses. Raiding has just died completely now, and for two reasons: the same loot drops in ten-player and twenty-five-player modes, so there is no need to make a big guild to do twenty-five-player. Therefore, guilds have shrank, and everyone was in a guild. No one was guildless, and if they were, it was very briefly, because there were so, so many barely useful guilds running around. This made it extremely tough to find players to join your guild so that you could raid, because everyone was already in tiny little guilds that could barely do anything. In Wrath, on the server I used to play on, there were three or four ""top guilds"" which were HUGE in size, and everyone wanted to join them. Yeah, casuals played in their dinky little guilds that never did anything, but at least ""Raiding Guilds"" actually existed. Even when moving to a populated server in MoP, I couldn't find a single guild that was worth a damn.

The other reason is Raid Finder. I know, I know, it's not meant to replace actual raids, but here's the thing: it has. People don't join guilds because there's no reason to. Why should they? You no longer need a guild to raid. Just run the baby raid. Your chances of getting gear are pretty much the same either way, and the stuff that drops from Raid Finder is only a few item levels lower than that of actual raid drops. So, when you think about it, why would anyone even bother joining a guild? If I was a casual player, I wouldn't. There's no point. Run the baby raid and never do anything with anyone on your server, ever.

I believe these two things have caused the steady decline in player accountability, respect, and of course, dignity. No one talks to each other except to call each other hateful, cruel things, or to spam general chat with crude, childish opinions. I felt lucky when another player even bother to say ""hello"" to me, and I was as polite as I could manage!! People will steal your mobs after waiting for them to kill you, they'll roll need on things they don't need, and they'll pretend to have good intentions when joining your guild, only to steal everything from your bank and running like hell. The world is packed FULL of these people. It's not just a small percentage, it's practically EVERYONE. If someone sees you're in trouble, they will NOT help you. They will simply stand there and watch you die, and never say a word to you. Ask someone for some help with quests? Forget about it. They call you something horrible or laugh or something, then blow you off. God forbid you ever accidentally kill one of the mobs someone meant to kill. You better put that person on ignore before they get a chance to sling ridiculous insults at you, usually insinuating your sexual orientation, regardless of your gender.

As I've said, I play many other MMORPGs. Everquest, Guild Wars 2, Dungeons and Dragons Online, Final Fantasy XI... none of which have a playerbase like WoW's. Take EQ for example... I have yet to run into a rude person. Even the cold, non-speaking types will surprise you and buy you some gear, even though they barely know you. People rely on each other, because if you help someone, IT MATTERS. For helping other people, it doesn't waste your time or hurt you in any way. Same with Guild Wars 2. I have never met a rude person in that game, either, and that's because it actually BENEFITS you to help other people, and furthermore, it's impossible to steal from others. In WoW, it's possible to steal from others, and there is no benefit whatsoever to applying your resources to save another player. People don't care, because they don't have to care. If you die, it doesn't hurt them in any way, hell, it may even help them, because a rare mob that they want to kill just hacked you to pieces. After running to your corpse, you see they took your rare mob and left. No one cares. Everyone is selfish. Everyone is a jerk.

Which brings me to my final point. Why would I want to play a game full of people that hate me for no reason? I'd rather play with someone who was a bad player but was at least friendly, than I would a mediocre player who is a complete jerk, but in MoP, they were scarce, and when you did find one, they left the guild in a matter of days, guild-hopping like crazy, because a guild is useless now. Why bother staying to prove yourself to your new guild? There's only ten people or so in it....

This is a harsh reality, but it's reality. If people don't see it, then they need to wake up and smell the coffee. WoW has a problem, and it's not going to get better the way it's going. By now, honestly, it should have been free-to-play. Most games have gone that route by now, and they really need to make some changes and stop being greedy. One of my main thoughts when leaving the game was ""why should I have to pay fifteen bucks a month to get crapped on every time I log on? There are better ways to spend my money."" I'm sure others have had the same mentality when quitting for good.

As for the game itself: The pandas are just stupid. I realize that most of the WoW playerbase is Asian........... but come on. I haven't met a Westerner who gives a crap about pandas. Everyone's reaction was pretty much a simultaneous groan, followed up by questions such as: why couldn't it have been Nagas or something cooler?

The environments are enjoyable, though they seem a bit recycled. Don't get me wrong, I really like them. It's easy to immerse yourself in Pandaria, because a lot of the zones are calming. I didn't like the Valley however. It strangely made me thirsty whenever I played in it. Let's just say that Pandaria is weak in aesthetics compared to the beautiful Northrend, and the music is nowhere near as good as Northrend's or Cata's, either. All-in-all, I just don't like Pandaria. I associate with boredom.

When I first started doing daily quests during MoP's launch, they were brutal on me. I was a freshly geared caster and the mobs cut through me like butter. I couldn't do most of the Shado-Pan quests without assistance from a friend. There are certain things I really love to grind, and reputation is one of them, but I can't stress enough how boring daily quests are. They're monotonous and mindless, and after doing the same dumb quest fifteen times each on multiple characters, you just want to strangle someone. If Blizzard were to change anything in the next expansion, it ought to be reputation via quests. Make it one long, continuous story quest, where each quest progresses you through the reputation, and each one gives a large chunk of reputation. Make it interesting, and if you're going to make daily quests, at least make them fun, not, ""Kill X a million times."" Since resubscribing recently, they're easier to tolerate because I have a couple of friends to do them with.

PvP: At launch, it was terrible. We lost more than half of our BGs because the Alliance (yes, I'm Horde), had way too many healers, and despite having more damage than heals on our team, we couldn't out-damage the healing constantly going around on their team. Now, I noticed a huge spike in wins, and their team isn't cluttered with healers every single game. We usually don't have more than two... but at least they usually don't, either. Of course, people still do the wrong thing (like running the flag in EotS, because hey, who cares?), but even the losses don't seem like such a waste of time anymore, because I'm not thinking ""get ready to lose the next four BGs, too."" It seems much more balanced now.

Raids and dungeons: Here are the raids I've tried in MoP-- MSV, HoF, and the first half of ToT. Of all of them, MSV was the funnest. Even with the same old ""run away from X, don't stand in Y, hit CDs at Z,"" it seemed more authentic. Some of the fights in the other two were just... dumb. Not HARD, just dumb. I don't really get psyched about weaving around tornadoes (too many headaches from Alysrazor) or killing spinning turtles. Again, not hard, just dumb. Elegon in MSV was the funnest raid fight I've done in MoP so far.

Mounts: I'm a collector, so I'm drawn to every new mount they released.

Pet battles: I didn't think I like these at first, but they were actually pretty fun. They're not required for anything but achievements, but they can be pretty addicting once you try them out.

UPDATE (5.4): Since the release of Timeless Isle, I've seen some improvements. The improvements aren't wide or sizable, but when it was released, floods of people returned to the game. Guilds are advertising once again. People are looking to do REAL raids, not just LFR, even if it's just Flex raids. All kinds of people are forming groups to get reputation together, inviting people in to help them get some kills and coins. There are no more daily quests, not on Timeless Isle. It's a breath of fresh air to be rid of those. You can collect BoA purple items to give to your fresh 90 alts to help gear them up faster (another brilliant addition, in my opinion, since I have a lot of alts now). Are there still trolls? Oh, absolutely, but I can honestly say I don't see as many as you'd think there would be. People still hurt others, but in ways that make it a bit more... productive, depending on your view. You can purchase items that flag you for PvP, regardless of faction. Sometimes you win... aaaand sometimes you lose... hard. You could face off against a class weaker than you who is semi-AFK from their keyboard only to get mutilated by a group of people who saw you do it. Now, people are still a bit on the lazy side, and communication is still... off at times. But since lots of players returned with this patch, it's only a minor complaint, as opposed to a major pandemic. With many new guilds forming and old ones recruiting for the new raid and core RBG groups, things on my realm seemed to have gotten a bit better. Before 5.4, the server was pretty dead, and only trolls were left hanging around.

UPDATE (5.3): I've returned to World of Warcraft after eight months of unsubscribing to reassess my opinion, to rejoin a returning companion, and to check out if anything has changed. If anything, I'd say things are a little worse, in terms of community. Here are some examples:
--No less than a week of playing, I've experienced someone pulling world bosses to grief raid groups. Not only did they wipe a raid once this way, but about four times. When asked to report the harassing offender, he laughed and said ""Lol GMs won't care, go ahead."" The sad thing is, he's totally right. He probably does this all the time, and never once got in trouble for it. When bringing it up to a friend of mine, she said ""Oh, yeah, it happens all the time."" So, half the populace is thirteen years old, I suppose. I have to question the motives behind this. Doesn't it waste a lot of time, not only yours, but everyone else's? What are you doing in this game where you are not entertained by anything else it has to offer and pay your fifteen bucks a month only to annoy others? It's depressing to think how it actually worked, because half of the raid left. I've never heard of such a thing as leaving a raid after a few short wipes. I stayed with the group and waited for more patient players and we killed the boss anyway. So, good job, and stuff.
--Ran roughly three Raid Finder raids, each one complete with its own ""jerk of the group."" Sure, everyone was a jerk in their own way the entire time, but it was so glaringly obvious who was the bigger one. First RF I ran after getting back, a shaman lost his mind when accused of using Bloodlust at an inopportune time. He started swearing and ranting and just wouldn't stop. I can't even remember if he was right or not, and it didn't matter. In another RF, someone constantly pulled trash mobs to grief the raid, and rolled need on every dropping green item. He was vote-kicked at least, but it cost everyone repair bills, because we continuously wiped on trash. In yet another RF, someone placed a feast down before a boss. Without a ready check or any warning, tank ran in and engaged before anyone got the chance to eat. When told off for it, they pronounced ""Sooner we get this over with, the sooner I can go out and get drunk."" So, people aren't really thirteen in the game, they just act like they're thirteen. The feast was wasted, by the way. I'm sure that player appreciates it. I have not run a single Raid Finder where something like this DIDN'T HAPPEN.
--When I came back, I saw no one ran normal raids on my realm. Ever. People sit in cities on their mount and troll trade. I got a new addon to help with that. More on that later.
--People kill-steal rare mobs by manipulating/exploiting game mechanics to reset their tap. Paladins camp Halfhill market and attack players, and via exploit, escape unharmed by guards while they kill the people he attacks. There is one particular guy on our server who does this all day, and I mean... all... day.

It's not that I can blame the players. Blizzard appealed to kids, and that's who flocked in. They are now down to 7.7 million subscribers, and are still losing large chunks of them in short time frames, the worst they've ever seen. I rarely see classic or BC veterans. I initially quit because I couldn't stand the kind of idiots I played with, but also because Pandaria is a little on the boring side and leveling there is a pain. I didn't mind banging out levels in Northrend because I liked Northrend.

I've been told once ""it doesn't matter where you go or what game you play-- you're going to get jerks no matter what. WoW is an MMO, so of course you're going to get mean players."" I disagree with that. I've already stated in this review that WoW was hardly the only MMO I've ever played. I've had the pleasure of playing with other communities, and I'm sorry, but they are nowhere near as bad as WoW's. Yes, there is truth in the statement that ""you will always have jerks,"" but it's in WoW where it's the worst. It's so bad that when someone tries to help me kill something, I think they're trying to hurt me in some way. That's how paranoid WoW has made me. I don't get that feeling of ""history of abuse"" in other games, in fact, I'm far more trusting. The average of polite players in other games is much higher than that of WoW's, because in those games, if you aren't nice, you aren't getting anywhere with anyone. You NEED to work together to complete something. In WoW, you can sit back and watch bosses die and just auto-attack. If there is no effort required, do you really, honestly think people are going to bother putting in any effort at all? Of course not.

I realize that WoW might possibly still have players that are just as tired of this plague of childishness as I am. Don't assume I hate every single WoW player. In my return, I've actually encountered some good people, who were surprisingly good players. Just yesterday I ran some YOLO RBGs with a bunch of completely random people, and they listened to our instructions quite well, didn't screw off, and we won our games. Some of them were cool to talk to, as well. The problem isn't them, of course. It's the other jerks around them ruining not only my experience, but theirs. They're addicted to WoW, just like I am, and maybe can't quit, because it's a big part of their life. That doesn't mean those people don't suffer through some of the most agonizing, irritating displays of selfishness. They're just stronger than I am for tolerating it and moving on.

It's realistic to think that ""trolls will be trolls,"" but I can live in a world of trolls. However, I cannot live in a World of Warcraft where every other person is out to waste your time, hurt you in some way, or make you feel bad. There is no other reason for it other than narcissistic satisfaction, of taking your problems out on others. I can even claim that it's not your fault. It's Blizzard's fault. They made this game for you, not for me, or the other hardworking individuals that put their sweat and blood into their raiding schedule. PvP is really the only reason to come back and stay, and if it's not your thing, stay away. That's all I can say about it. Luckily, I really enjoy PvP, and PvP is one of the few things WoW does right.

Update: I began to utilize an addon called ""OQueue,"" a very handy little tool that allows you to create groups for all types of WoW things such as raids, dungeons, BGs and RBGs, and advertise for it cross-realm. You can also join one of the many other groups being advertised on a constant basis. It allows me to do raids and RBGs despite the fact that my server has lost half its population. If I were to try to get a group on my own server, I'd be searching for hours and might not even fill the raid group. I don't have to run LFRs all the time after all. I can actually be a part of something greater. If you're interested, you can download OQueue at Curse.com.

Speaking of LFRs, I continued to run some over the course of my return. In every group, someone rolls need on green items."

411731,2,"Boring with little to no story/purpose. It's a cool experience the first hour but then it just becomes pointless. It shares a lot in common with Journey only its in space instead of a desert, though, given the lack of excitement, it might as well be set in the Sahara. In its own right, it's not a terrible space sim but rather a victim of hype.

If your idea of fun is spending hours going to a galactic core by blasting things with a laser and jumping into a ship and repeating it hundreds of time, this game is for you. As for me personally, I have better things to do. I will most likely never play it again as I just became too bored after an hour, maybe there's more to it, but they don't make it easy to know where to go which is the death of mostly every open-world game minus the witcher.

Save your money and get Ur-Quan Masters for free instead, that's a real space game with a real story that's actually fun (it's the free to play version of Star Control 2).

If they update the game with an actual story like discovering ancient alien artifacts and creating alliances to save the galaxy from an evil threat or something that can give life to this dead and meaningless universe, I'll update my review. As an indie game it's 3.5-4 stars but as a AAA title as it's being hyped as, in no way does this have anything on Uncharted 4, Until Dawn, Witcher 3 or Metal Gear."
6278,2,"Let's just get one thing out of the way, the battle system in this game is bad. Very bad. There are much too many random battles, a lot of the time you're ""drawing"" magic from enemies (a HORRIBLE idea on square's part, it makes no sense and is extremely tedious) both to use and EQUIP it to your characters. Since the power of your equipped magic is based in the number you have, and all of your enemies have an unlimited number of the magics they're able to carry, you spend a LOT (a WHOLE lot, HOURS) of time just hitting that draw button and selecting which magic to get from them. Yeah, not fun, at all. Both the equipment and magic systems are bad. The new focus on summoned monsters as equippable characters which level up and gain skills to boost your character, such as strength upgrades or upgrades to themselves which boost their damage or HP, is really not fun at all, since there's zero strategy involved. You just level up and decide which skill they'll learn after enough battles. I easily blew through the first half of this game, killing bosses in a ludicrously low number of hits. I couldn't stand the second half, it was just more of the same, and the story line became very, very stupid. A select few will actually like this sappy love story mixed with something about a summoner going to destroy the world and some other junk that I just didn't care about. The love story was actually the best part, and the rest felt like a filler. There really isn't anything to praise about this game that separates it from previous Final Fantasy games. A sub-par RPG."

It was traditional top/bottom split screen and was perfect. Now you can only play with the screen split vertically, making it difficult to see upcoming turns and the like. Was a 5 star game... If they fix this mistake, it will be again."
64803,2,"I'm not really here to comment on Madden's game, but from what I here it's not all that great. I just want to comment on what the person under me said ""the best football game this year"". Hey dumb*ss, it's the only football game this year! Madden played the coward this year by buying all of the NFLPA credits, so they wouldn't get overtaken by ESPN's NFL 2K6(ESPN 2K5 is a far better game than Madden 2005, *check out my review on it*). They knew that ESPN's game had been creeping up on them for years and would finally pass them up on sales this year. But, the p*ssy Madden owners were too scared to allow that. So they bought up the credits and put out an exact replica of Madden 2005 (Madden 2006). The only difference is the Accurate Passing. I heard it's not that great. What's a matter EA Sports? Can't take a little competition? Isn't that what football's all about?"

428199,2,"I owned a Turtle Beach PX24 (also broken in the same way) where the plastic above the right ear was cracked and broken.  I am giving this one 2 stars as I did own it for a few years before the issue occurred (compared to the four months I owned the PX24).  There is a reason why an extended warranty is not offered on these (they have a 90-day limited warranty), it's because the quality of its construction is absolute garbage.  Do yourselves a favor and save $50 and pick up an SA928 (quality construction)."
264291,2,"So you know that feeling you get when there's this series or game that's awesome, and you hear about a REAL continuation to the main storyline, and...then you have this cop-out with a lot of add-ons that seem designed to pull in fans of OTHER series?

Imagine a long-time fan of The Lone Ranger. Imagine, the recent movie has JUST been ""unofficially"" been announced, and...the fan knows the movie's not going to be the same, I mean, there's only ever ONE Lone Ranger, but...
And then the poster. Everything the fan grew up on with The Lone Ranger, and all the work put in to even FIND the stuff, I mean, this WAS the late 90s, and even now hasn't seen it all...and along comes this...this MOCKERY. This...this face-painting and...I mean...

Apply it to Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance. The Lone Ranger mockery, the disappointment of Tales of Symphonia 2 and its complete and total LACK of the events of ToS what with Emil being essentially ignorant of...well...enough of ""recent"" events to not being even ruffled by the world suddenly being doubled in size and people...and this giant plant destroying half of one side of the world...and all that...there's no need to actually, you know, talk about what happened in the last game, because it's not relevant? And oh, hey, what's this Regeneration System? What? The world was split in two? When did...4k years ago? Umm...sure...I know all about it.......yeah...(not...really.... I'm confused...)

This disappointment, this let-down, was like all that. Combined. Not that it was anything like what happened with ToS 2...except what's this monster battle system? Oh. Pacts. Where's Tenebrae to make them? At least HE was funny...
It's not any one thing, really. It's just...not what I was expecting. And I wasn't expecting much, even. Just more KH and a relatively similar...what's this? Changed up the entire real KH system? Oh, the parts are there...they're just kinda floating around, disconnected, occasionally bumping into each other...

All that stuff with the Gummy Ship system? It's like this entire game is made of that level of...crap. At least at the end of the Gummy Ship battles you have a new world and never really have to battle that section again if you don't want to. This? It's like you take KH and make it as exciting and fun and...playable...as GS battles. ALL of it. One big Gummy Ship battle. Oh, and please add something between ""Random Monsters Beating Up Your Enemies"" and ""Tales of Symphonia 2's Pact System Monsters Helping You By Dying"". Real drudgery. That's the word.

KH:DDD is DRUDGERY."

369505,3,"Have been playing Destiny since the Alpha and decide to give it a go.  While not the worst game, there is a huge lack of content for $60 and co-op play doesn't make up for that.  You basically will experience the same content 100's of times if you enjoy repeating the same thing over again to make any progress.

About half are easy or predictable. There are a couple of difficult ones that will get you stumped and will make you feel like a genius if you figure it out on your own :) And there are a few that are almost impossible unless you are a member of Mensa.

440114,3,"The 3rd Gen Astro A50's are plagued with glitches, Audio Drop outs, bad design choices, all packed into such a great little package. That makes this the most mixed product of Amazing Pros and Stupid Cons I have ever used.

FIRST Ignore the Patch notes as of December 27th, 2016.
As of right now ALL issue reported since this headphone released still occur. And ALL occured to me in the course of 24 hours.

List of CONS

- Audio Drop outs
Just like it says, the audio will randomly cut out 2, 3, 4 times for about 20-30 seconds and then go back to working

- Issues pairing the headset to the base.
The headset comes paired with the base, but for no reason at all will randomly lose it's pairing.

- Firmware update fails and causes headphones to crash
To fix this Hold down the Game and Dolby buttons for 30 seconds to ""reboot"" the headphones. Put it back in the base and try to update the firmware again.

- These DO NOT easily go from PC to Xbox/PS4. You need to move the USB cable each time AND Change the PC/Xbox Switch.
Why bother having the switch if the USB cable needs to be swapped each time?

- No Audio jack on the headphones
If the battery Dies or you have a portable device you are out of luck.

- Audio jack on the base has tons of distortion over the microphone.
Like it says, there is some kind of electrical buzz going through the audio jack's mic return. Mine randomly went away after about 12 hours and has been working fine so far.

- Dolby Surround sound is fake-ish
The surround sound button only makes everything sound like it is in a tin can. However with some games it works... It does not work with ANY movies yet as far as I can tell. I have 2 other 5.1 Headphones and a real 5.1 speaker setup to compare it against and the Surround sound on the Astro A50's is total garbage. It just makes it sound like you are in a giant metal room

- Sleep mode?
Headphones appear to go to sleep after 15 minutes and completely lose sound without turning off Optical audio on the Xbox and re-enabling it. (Stereo or Dolby Only, DTS did not work at all.)

- Microphone sounding robotic
They added features to adjust the Noise Gate and quality on the microphone, it sounds better. But still no where near as clean as most Turtle Beach mics.

List of PROs

- 3-4 Inputs
USB to Xbox for Chat
SPDIF to Xbox for game Audio
AUX to PC for Mic and Sound
or
USB to PC and shows as 2 sound cards. 1 for Sound and 1 for Chat
SPDIF to Xbox or PC for 5.1
AUX to Phone for phone calls (Phone will need to be near base or you will need a long wire)

- Comfort These are the 2nd most comfortable headphones I have ever used. The first being the Turtle Beach Elite Pros. With that said the comfort is nearly perfect and the comfort is simply different that with the Elite Pros

- LOUD
These get nice and loud. I have a HUGE issue with most Wireless headphones or headphones plugged into the controller where they are just not loud enough at max volume. TIP - For EXTRA loudness plug it into the AUX port, that port easily pumps out the most volume.

- Bass
The headphones ""Can"" have very good bass with the right equalizer settings. I found the base ""Astro"" setting to be the best for some nice BOOM.

- Crisp
The sound can get soooo bright it hurts. These are very versatile headphones they can give you deep lows or sharp painful highs.

- Wireless Range
I walked 2 rooms away and went upstairs and they still reached through my horse hair plaster walls. It had a cut out here and there, but I did not expect them to work that far. So Excellent Range!

- Neck-a-bilitiy The comfort level when around your neck
These are the most comfortable headphones when just hanging on your neck, they open up wide and the ear cups rotate flat to sit comfortably around your neck without rubbing or choking you.

Closing Comments:

The initial setup with these headphones was a nightmare. For $250 from a 3rd gen product from Astro was horrid. Absolutely the worst first impression for a product I have EVER experienced.

Please note I have only owned these for 72 hours and I have encountered ALL of the issues listed above. With a TON of googling and sifting through forums for fixes and workarounds.

I will be holding on to my receipt and see how these perform in the coming 2 weeks before the return policy expires.

The Astro A50's have a TON of bugs to be worked out. And I hope they do get everything fixed. But I have dealt with Astro in the past. Issues with their headphones can go on for months without any fixes and their support team is an absolute nightmare. The worst support in the industry. So I do not have very high hopes that the Gen3  A50's will be in working order in the next year. I hope so, cause I love these things... But man what a disappointing initial experience."
272406,3,"We bought this to try and keep my daughter's games in order. The problem is it broke the first time she tried to take the games out. It still keeps the games together, but I wish it was a little bit tougher. With this being a case for DS games it should be assumed kids are going to be using it. Therefore it should have some sort of ruggedness because kids can just be tough on things."
443681,3,"Similar to the first Resident Evil game but completely lacking the fun and replayability factor.  This isn't a bad game, it's just merely okay, which is disappointing for a Resident Evil game.  As I progressed further into the game, I was hoping for more diversity in the enemies, and maybe just a little more combat.  Instead you get the exact same monsters throughout the entire game.  No zombies, no hunters, no dogs, no Ganados, no soldiers, or anything with any kind of personality.  Personally, I found ""The Evil Within"" to be a much better successor to the Resident Evil series than this.

Yes, we were a bit worn out with all the ""Call of Duty"" style action of RE6, but it seems they could have had some balance.  RE4, arguably the pinnacle of the series, had a great balance of combat and exploration.  Once you finished that game, you wanted to start over and play it again.  Sure, you can replay RE7 and try to get bigger and better guns, but for what?  There really isn't that much combat to make it worth it.

Once I got to the end of the game, I was hoping there would be some bonus content (similar to ""The Mercenaries"") that would make me want to keep playing.  But there was nothing.  I admire the fact that Capcom wanted to try something different, and it's fun to play through once, but that's about it.  I'll probably end up trading it in within the next few weeks."
42481,3,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Matrix. I grew up on Philip K. Dick novels, and the whole Matrix concept is one I've always loved. I thought the movie's plot, characters and special effects were great. Also, I'm a big fan of Splinter Cell and played it many times. I've always loved the Bond style games where you work your way through a level, finding objectives and taking out the bad guys.

So while I really, really wanted to be blown away by Enter the Matrix, I just wasn't. It was a GOOD game, but not nearly as good as it should have been - not nearly as good as many other games that are out right now. I almost wonder if they rushed the game into production to match the timing of the movie, instead of finishing up some much-needed polishing.
First, the good parts. It was directed by the Wachowski brothers and features the quite talented actors and actresses from the movies. It really ties in to the movie and sort of 'immerses' you in the experience. So that is quite neat. They do have Matrix-time ""focus"", much like in Dead to Rights, where you can temporarily slow time and do cool moves. Just like in Dead to Rights, it seems cool at first and is hardly used in actual gameplay.
Gameplay is intriguing. You're given general objectives but then have to figure out how to get to them. So you're not exactly led by the nose. There are sometimes big rooms with lots of directions, lots of offices, lots of choices. Still, the game is about getting from Point A to Point B. I definitely miss Vice City's free-roam ability.
I was pretty disappointed by the graphics. There are many other games out right now with truly STELLAR graphics, and this isn't one of them. Objects vanish from the screen. The rendering just isn't very good, compared to other games we play quite a bit. The physics models are a bit bizarre. People slide like hockey pucks across the floor. You can leap on some things but not on others, apparently at random.
The sound has serious issues. My brand new CD right from the store started double-talking almost immediately in several scenes. Also, one of the hallmarks of a great game is that the sound is context sensitive - quiet and brooding at times, thundering at the exciting parts. But this game is ALWAYS thundering. It gets very monotonous after a while and completely destroys the atmosphere.
The load time is incredibly long, and many missions are incredibly short. There are times that you almost load longer than you get to play that mission area! With the instant-reheal-totally, the instant-restart-10-seconds-ago and the lack of challenging enemies to fight, most of the game is a cakewalk.
Add to that the quite annoying aspect that there are times that a door won't open until you kill all enemies in the room. So you go around and check the doors, but you have to slay everyone there before the ""special door"" will open up. Yes, some games use that technique. But this game in general is supposed to be a realistic adventure. In realistic adventures, doors don't sense when all enemies are dead and then spring open.
AI, one of THE most important parts of any game, is spotty at best. Sometimes the guards hide behind cover. Sometimes they stand in the open when cover is right next door. I've had cases where a guard stood pointing a gun at a door even though I was right behind him, pounding the stuffing out of 2 of his friends. He didn't even turn around until I bashed him in the head.
And finally, the camera is just plain annoying. Every friend I've had try this game says the same thing. They all play tons of adventure and action games. Somehow this game just does a bad job with positioning the camera anywhere useful.
The game really had a great deal of potential and I think with another month or two in QA testing it could have shone. But there are many, many areas that appear to have gotten through in a ""good enough"" state instead of a ""ready for prime time"" state.
Yes, I'll play the game. And yes, I'll see the movies many, many times and talk about them endlessly with my programmer / hacker friends. But I do feel let down that with all of the money and talent available to the Wachowski brothers, they didn't give this game the attention it merited. They focussed on the MOVIE aspect of the game, but not the GAME aspect."
66594,3,"First of all- I am a casual gamer. I do not know about technical things with graphics, so my comments are based purely on how a middle-aged woman (who enjoys mildly difficult games and marvels at stunning graphics) found Myst V.

The graphics were disappointing, to say the least. There wasn't enough color and detail- most scenes were tones of gray, browns, etc. I played the game using a Radeon x800 on a brand new tower, so it was not a matter of hardware. After Uru and Riven, I expected much better, especially since came with several discs to download.

There were no views giving us tantalizing glimpses of other worlds, no animals (except for a bird and a couple of stray butterflies), no people, no intricate details either static or moving. Esher's costume moving was nice, as was the grass and palm trees.

The first time I saw the Bahro (the creature who does your bidding), I thought something was wrong with the program- chunky body pieces and jerky movements. Pitiful considering it was from the company that set the standard.

Yeesha is still weird. Esher is about the only active, living thing in the whole game and I found myself liking him simply for that reason. I don't know how he and Yeesha were made, but surely there are better programs for animating people. A video clip would have been much preferable.

I do not like very hard puzzles and make good use of internet hints, so my opinion of the puzzles will not be helpful to most serious gamers. Sorry. A few made sense, but many did not. If you like difficult puzzles, you will be happily entertained for the most part.

I thoroughly enjoyed Myst, Riven, and Uru and will go back and play them again, just for the lovely graphics...but not this one.

Bottom line: there was no ""WOW!"""
163696,3,I have not played this game a whole lot yet.  The controls defintely take some getting used to.  It is not quite arcade flight but not a flight simulator either.  It seems fun but at least for me as a steeper learning curve.
408350,3,"Every time you press ""B"" you restart the race???? This becomes beyond frustrating after a few times."
308380,3,"Not sure exactly WHAT I was hoping for, just something.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  Either way, the controls are pretty good.  The intro,....wow,...they really should have left that out.  SUPER cheesy!  But it doesn't affect the game in any way.  You just have to wait thru it to start playing.  I've only played it a couple hours at this point, but there's really nothing special about it."
340112,3,"The game looks and plays great to me. I loved having another Metal Gear property especially one on the PS4. I really can't stress how great this game looks. However, as much as I loved a lot of aspects of it it really is a glorified demo. I don't feel so bad about getting it because I traded in some games I no longer paid. So as I saw it I didn't come ""out of pocket"" for this game, but really I could've used it for something else or begged a friend to bring over his copy he got from Gamefly.

While I really want to give it at least 4 stars, I can't help but to feel a bit let down in a way. I mean it felt great having a new ""game"", but this title really is a bloated/glorified demo.

Don't get me wrong, it's worth playing, but consider Gameflying it or waiting for a price drop on Amazon. $5-10 maybe would be better, but really you shouldn't pay for demo games period."
136491,3,"There's one very annoying thing about the Game of the Year Edition for the PS3 that makes me glad I didn't pay extra for it: it's no different than the regular edition. While the PC version offers extras, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for the PS3 no longer gives you the bonus map pack (or anything else) for paying extra and purchasing the Game of the Year Edition.  Any additional map packs (I found one, the ""Variety Map Pack"") have to be downloaded from the PlayStation store for an extra fee. If you're looking at the GotY edition for the purpose of multiplayer, keep this in mind as nothing extra comes in the GotY and the ""Variety"" map pack costs extra to purchase. The ""bonus map pack"" referred to on Activision's site was a limited-time-only promotion.

Now that I've played this game on the PC, XBox 360, and PS3, I have to say that the XBox 360 feels just a bit better--but the PS3's translation is still very good. As a PC Gamer coming to consoles, I have a hard time finding a first-person shooter that I'm even barely competent in. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare for the PS3 has been one of the best translations for me (my other favorite is the Orange Box). It has a very ""playable"" feel, making my WASD-familiar brain feel very comfortable switching over to the PS3's controller.  While I've seen more than one title using very obvious auto-aim, making your reticle snap-to and stick or making anyone in the neighborhood of your shots magically sprout magnets and pull fire to them, CoD: Modern Warfare doesn't do this. Instead it just makes it easier for me to center on my target while I'm running and/or crouching, jumping, etc.--it's like the right stick moves consistently smoother. That makes it just plain easier to multi-task. Given that I typically have some pretty hefty hardware on the PC, I wasn't certain if the PS3 version would match the quality of my high-end gaming machine.  I was pleasantly surprised when things looked just as sharp on the console as they do on the PC:  the programmers definitely took advantage of the PS3's unique hardware.

I've now played this game's Single-Player Campaign through more than once, and loved it. Like other titles in the Call of Duty series, it uses team-based play, and simulates your team using the computer to ""drive"" your teammates. Continuing in the tradition of the other titles, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare adds more structure to the missions, more life to the characters, and more depth to the story. You spend most of the game as new recruit 'Soap' MacTavish, but you also get to flash back to an earlier point in the story, play as your commanding officer, and learn more about him.

One odd departure from other games is that there are storyline sequences that are not exactly ""playable"", but neither are they cutscenes. You live a segment of the storyline through the eyes of the person going through it. These are short, so they don't frustrate, and what they do is heighten the drama. It's an interesting technique, and because it isn't overused, it works well here to keep the storyline going.

Another great pacing trick is that the storyline spans countries. It crosses continents and it puts you in more than one spot: one of my favorites was manning three guns using night-vision cameras aboard a large plane as it provides air support to your team on the ground. Overall, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare graphics are very detailed, the environments feel authentic, and the sounds impressed me. I liked the dialogue and I really enjoyed the fact that my teammates seemed to be somewhat intelligent. There were some really neat goals in each mission, and I have fond memories of the adrenaline rush. I'm delighted that they made a Modern Warfare 2."
430626,3,"The Division, what can I say?

You got the good and the bad. The game is pretty fun with friends, though I don't like playing it alone much. I played it a bunch when it first released, but to me, the game died off and I don't really play it that much. I would recommend to get it only if there was a good sale on the game and you had a friend to play with. Otherwise it's a pretty repetitive game that was a bit too over-hyped."
81845,3,"For those who just want the essence, here it is: this is a fun, well made game. If you can find it cheap, and you can, I'd definitely recommend picking it up.

The graphics are top notch! The game is really well constructed and user friendly. There's lots of cool monsters, a big game world, plenty of stuff to...kill, mostly...lots of treasure...I know it sounds pretty standard, but Titan Quest is, overall, a pretty standard fantasy game.

You'll develop your character semi-D&D style, and shape him into an incredible hero. Don't count on fleshing him/her out too much though. Character customization basically means how your character annihilates monsters.

One major con is the lack of plot and character. Characters you meet in the game are pretty useless and offer tons of boring, heavy-handed dialogue. The dialogue isn't very interactive like you might find in more authentic RPGs, which is good for some and bad for others.

The plot? Meh. There's monsters, you're the hero, you kill the monsters, you save the day. Everyone lives happily ever after!

It's VERY reminiscent of the Diablo games, Dungeon Siege and a few others. That's not a bad thing! But this baby doesn't bring much new to the table. It's basically a fun, fast, pretty hack-n-slasher.

That said, it's not nearly as adult as some other games and would be just fine for a younger audience. If they can stand the dull greek banter. Ugh."
44016,3,"Far better than San Andreas and a huge improvement of GTA3. Best addition: MOTORCYCLES. Also you can buy properties and houses which leads to more save spots and more missions to do. Excellent game overall when compared to the others in the series. Alhough it is still rockstar, which means it has its frustrating points. Cars still randomly explode when you flip em. And it is extremely easy to die. But still fun for a couple of hours. Not worth the money though guys, for lack of replayability."
138163,3,My son loves it
331853,3,its a decent mount but just to clarify it won't fit on wall mounted TV's. If you have a free standing LCD/LED TV it will work great.
53067,3,Title basically said it all. This is a game that's worth buying if you can find it for $20 - $30 or better yet cheaper but it's not worth $50. My main flaw with this is that it was too easy.
77006,3,Fun but I don't know how to unlock achievements and title shots
87901,3,"I am enjoying the whole COD series, but this game was more frustrating than fun. The collision detection was too precise. A guy walking over rubble will step over things like a suitcase, but COD3 stops you at such trivial obstacles. The A.I. is unbelivavly stupid, always getting in the way and blowing me up with their grenades. Not as much fun as COD4 or COD2."
492595,3,Not a lot of stuff here. Only about four hours of total playtime. Buy if you get a ten buck sale buck other than that its not really worth it.
77008,3,"It is OK, but from the description I thought it would be more erotic. Just a few women in normal swim wear fighting."
201033,3,"The joystick doesn't use the rechargable lythium ion batteries like a normal PS3 controller, you have to use AA batteries. Even worse is the wireless technology, whereas the PS3 controllers connect to the console itself via bluetooth, this controller requires a USB dongle that's just asking to be lost. Why isn't there a compartment to store the dongle on the controller itself?

374999,3,"There is so much that gamers have said about the Wii U. It has showed Nintendo has moved the furthest away from the game gimmicks that Sony & Microsoft are trying to deliver, with what Nintendo already had done with the Wii. But with every game system coming out, there are a few gimmicks that won't work as well to start with. That is the case with the Wii U controller. It works very well on some games like Sonic & Sega All-Stars Transformed and Madden 2013. Surprisingly, it will or work with games like New Super Mario Brothers U, or the original Nintendo Wii games either, like Super Smash Brothers Brawl. But down the road, there will be more games compatible to the Wii U Pro Controller, and hopefully those will make the Wii U sparkle with the controller.

274089,3,I played it for a few weeks and got bored pretty quickly. It just became stale for me. I love the graphics but there's something I can't put my finger on. I started playing other games that are more colorful and more fantasy based and it seems to keep me entertained more.
292066,3,"I'm a huge fan of the Halo series and a huge admirer of Bungie.  I must say, out of all the games I saw presented at E3 a couple years ago, Destiny is the one I most anticipated.  Heck, I pre-ordered it, which I rarely do for a game unless it's something I really, really want.  The game looks amazing, proving the PS4 and Bungie did a great job; it always amazes me to see next gen (actually, current gen if you think about this hardware technically being a few years old when it was first created) graphics and remember the days of pixelation chaos and even what passed as amazing back in the day (the original Halo anyone? Yeah, I'm not talking about the Anniversary edition).  There really isn't that much to say about the voice acting because, besides the cut scenes (I actually love cut scenes and wish there were more, especially since Destiny feels so stark with its dialogue and story elsewhere - more about that later), there really isn't that much of it.  As other reviews have pointed out, Destiny is much less big than what many people expected it to be.  You land someplace, get out, shoot stuff up, find something, then go back and find another place to do it again - seriously, that is pretty much all you do.  Now don't get me wrong, that's perfectly fine and what Destiny does it does well, but it definitely wasn't what I was expecting.  That's not to say I don't enjoy it, because it's a fun game.  It's actually the kind of game your PS4 was made for.  But instead of being something to delight the tongue, Destiny is really pretty vanilla; I love vanilla, but sometimes it's too bland, and that's exactly what Destiny is to me."

49712,3,"Max Payne is about to relive some harsh times. Picking up the pieces of his shattered life, Max resumes his role as a detective, tying up the loose ends from the original game in a much, improved, slicker and gloomier sequel.

Chasing a group of contract killers, Max runs into various figures from his past, such as Mona Sax, his unspecified love, Alfred Wooden, the Inner Circle organization and nearly everyone who was left breathing from the first title. The plot feels like a standalone title, while the same cast appears and the back story is touched upon at certain points, you never feel as you're playing a real sequel, mainly revisiting old faces and wrapping up the first game. One again Max delivers moody inner monologue, spoken amongst much better looking storyboards paired with animated cinematic scenes that neatly tie it all together with a drop of noir, mixed with a love story overtone.

Every positive thing returns in this game, only greatly improved. Characters move and act in a very realistic way with wonderful looking graphics, far more superior then the original. Max even has more than one facial expression this time. Bullet time, a staple of the series, has also improved, lasting longer and making quicker to access to use against fewer enemies allows it to be used more sparingly. All the sweet weapons make a second appearance, looking ever more lifelike and sounds just as great.

Rise and Fall of Max Payne is truly the improved and far better sequel even if it doesn't feel as such. It looks, sounds and feels much better, making one wonder why this title didn't arrive first, matched with the original story. Unfortunately all the immeasurable positives are almost overshadowed by two large negatives that can't be ignored; length and gratification. Playing the adventure just doesn't seem to be as fun this time around, parity due to the serious story and suitable to the fact this is a short game, short enough to beat and have a few days left on your rental. Payne may look good; it just doesn't feel as good the second time around.

Last Words: B-, great looking, serious entry that falls short of the original experience."
490575,3,"This game is mediocre at best - it has an interesting concept and some things are done quite well but others are a complete mess.

The Good:
1) Combat/Upgrading: This is really the best the game has to offer.  Combat was handled well and you level up quickly.  You can customize skills and each talent can be upgraded twice.  You can play as a two-handed warrior or a ranger with daggers. To be most effective, you don't want to go middle of the road here - pick either the warrior or ranger and upgrade the skills in that stance. You also have access to a crossbow and traps.  Whether you play as a warrior or ranger, you have access to magic in the form of fire attacks and you can assign your favorites to specific buttons for ease of use.  The fire attacks can also be upgraded so you can make your favorites as powerful as possible.
2) Graphics & Load Times:  The game looks decent and cut scenes are adequate. There are some lighting issues and once the background completely disappeared during combat but I didn't have issues with lag even with multiple characters on screen. Load times are fairly fast but all of the areas/maps are small.  The game froze one time.  The camera is not fixed so that was not a problem.
3) Customization: In addition to the skill upgrades, you can upgrade all weapons and armor to add things like physical resistance, magic resistance, etc.  You can also make your own potions, traps and crossbow arrows, which you can do at any time even during battle.  You also have skills (separate from your weapon/magic skills) that can be upgraded such as adding damage, reducing items needed for potions, etc.  Again, just focus on those that best support your play style.
4) Enemy AI: While there isn't a huge variety of enemies in the game, the AI is actually decent.

The Bad:
1) Story: Sadly, the story is mediocre at best, which is a shame because the premise is fine, it was just poorly written.
2) RPG Search Mania: The game is very linear so exploring is limited and pointless.  Once you complete a chapter, you cannot go back to complete any unfinished quests. There is little reason to search every nook and cranny because chests, etc are limited and clearly visible from a distance. You can pick up items after you kill nearly every enemy, which helps with upgrades and potion making.
3) Character Appearance:  Basically you choose to play as male or female, pick a standard face and hairstyle and that's it - it takes about 1 minute to start a game.  Oh, you also get to enter a name but its pointless because you will never see that name anywhere in the game  - your name is Vulcan...too bad if you don't like it.
4) Party Members:  You can only have one party member with you and you have to ask them to come with you or you will be playing solo. All of the party members are rather useless and most are incredibly boring.  You can initiate a conversation but there are limited responses and after you use them, its over.  Unless you babysit them in battle they tend to die quickly though they can be useful to draw away enemy attacks.  Yes, I used my party as cannon fodder.  There is also limited interaction - you can set the party member to be offensive, defensive or focus on their special skill but you can't customize or level them up.

The Ugly:
1) Voice Work: This has to be the worst voice acting I have heard in a very long time.  It's so bad that it's hilarious - play as the female character if you really need a laugh.  Its cheesy, vulgar, poorly timed and just a hot mess.  I would not recommend playing this around little kids or those that are easily offended because they frequently drop the F-bomb and it is usually out of context.  I mean someone says hello and you just start cursing at them.  The NPC voice work is equally bad.  There is one blacksmith that literally screams at you in a robotic voice when you talk to him ""HELLO VULCAN!! "" It mostly sounds like they are all reading and the dialogue is just really bad.  Also some of the characters are incredibly annoying like the Knight that refers to himself in the third person or the demon that possesses you, which says things like ""Thou hast abandoned me. Whilst I were hereth waiting. HA!""  Uh, what?
2) Decisions:  The decisions you make have minimal impact.  You can be a hero or a complete jerk but it really doesn't do much overall.
3) Romance: Ha ha haha...don't bother.  I played as the female character and decided to romance the elf - mostly because I had finished all of the lame quests he wanted me to do.  First off, there is no indication that any character is interested in you romantically - I mean not so much as a flirt or a batted eyelash or anything.  SPOILER ALERT:  This was the entire romance: he held my hand then begrudgingly kissed me in the dark, dank ,stinky sewer that was filled with piles of dead bodies and flies.  Then we left and never spoke of it again.  How romantic.  I'm blushing as I write this.  Sorry if I've ruined things for your Elf romance though I actually I received a trophy for that.
4) Endings: There are three endings and each one is disappointing.
5) NG+:  Nope.  Once you finish a game, you have to start over from scratch.

So, bottom line - this isn't a terrible game. In terms of the combat and upgrade system it's actually quite good but if you are looking for a deep story, you will be disappointed.  If you can overlook it's shortcomings and the absolutely hideous voice work/dialogue and if you understand that it has little to do with what most of us think of as an RPG, its worth playing especially if you are bored and sick of the games you have.  That being said, don't even consider paying full price for it."

177537,3,"I have finally finished this game and it is average to slightly above average.  If the Wii is the only system you have it is still one of the better games on the system.  The game is average because of the problems.

First,

I was able to shoot enemies through doors.  On one part I just walked through the door and backed back through and let the door shut.  The enemies came to the door and I could see their head through the door and shot them.  I was at one section were I shot multiple enemies through the cover they were behind.  This happened in many places.

Second,

The enemies are dumb.  They will run out in front of you a lot and just stand there for a few seconds while you wipe them out.

Third,

The game is not very challenging even on the highest setting.  With the dumb AI and the ability to get enemies in situations were you can shoot them through the doors and the walls/objects it take some challenge away.

Lastly,

The online is not near as good as i was hearing or expected.  I have never experienced connection problems with any other game or even when downloading games and software.  But i played online for a while and noticed that you could unload 2 clips into another player as they charged in for a melee kill with one hit.  I caught on and tried it and sure enough.  Just charge in and melee and you will 9 times out of 10 win.

That is what i thought was wrong with the game.  Now, for what i liked.

I thought the controls were pretty good and responded very well.  The graphics are not bad at all and things look like they are suppose to with the detail needed to make things out.  The story isn't to bad if you like this kind of story.  And the enemies keep coming, out of the portals so you are forced to push forward and close them, or out of egg pods that you have destroy to stop the growth of new enemies.  And although the problems above were apparent I still enjoyed the game as it was fun and the online can be fun with friends.

All together i recommend this game for the Wii owner.  Without the problems i would have given the game a 5-star as it is really fun.  So, if you can look past the problems definitely get this game."
51259,3,"BAD:

The memory card manager corrupted my memory card and destroyed saves.  It takes a long time for the disk to load, and like most cheat devices many codes don't work and it also causes freezing quite often.  This device uses a different type of code than any other device so your stuck with what the manufacturer come up with...which isn't that great.

GOOD:

The most usefull part to me is that it lets you play different region DVDs on the PS2.  Also, the ability to download codes and gamesaves is pretty cool.

Over all this is a decent buy, but I would probably be happier with a Codebreaker or the newer USB AR MAX."

142087,3,"First off let me say that the PSeye is great,but when I got the product it was not in it's original packaging and when I called Worldwide Distibutors they assured me that the the item was new and that the ps eye never comes with instructions Which is obviously a LIE!!!!!!! I had to call Playstation customer service and asked them to email me the instructions they also said that their items always come in official Playstation packaging no matter who they sell to. By buying this from Worldwide Distributors I did not get original packaging, instructions,and the manufacturers warranty which is typically 1 year which gives me peace of mine for 1 year. My advice to you is to make sure it's shipped and sold by  amazon if not get it from the store for around 3-4 dollars more u get the warranty, instructions and packaging which is a must for gifting. BTW this is my first order that wasn't satisfactory from amazon, my first among hundreds so amazon is still a great place to shop online, but please write reviews about your experiences good or bad as people like me never buy an item until we read the reviews, Thank You."

I understand that it just came out and is probably really busy, but there was no excuse for the weird glitches unrelated to that!

It started this great franchise but part one is not a great game and borders on avg to good."
18076,3,NBA Live has consistantly been the best basketball game on the market and every year new things are added.  Untill now.  This years version is just average.  The game looks great and the players are very detailed and the new post up option is great.  Unfortunatly the 1 on 1 mode is very boring.  Another downer is that the players don't have thier actuall faces and the three point shootout is missing.  The games season option lost some of its appeal without a franchise mode available.  I hope EA uses this game as a stepping stone and improves on it next year by adding some new modes and working on the gameplay.  Despite these few let downs the game is still a blast when playing with a group of friends and a multi-tap.
284161,3,download is long and game graphic sucks but still works
240518,3,"RE 2 is my favorite game in the series, and RE 3 is a close second.
So I love that they returned with elements and characters from those games-- even though the stories are too action-laden and unbelievable even by RE's outlandish standards. I felt as if they needed to pause the action sometimes, let the player regroup and determine what else was planned *in order to build tension* (as they did in the classic games from this series) THEN we could go in with guns blazing.
Instead, as someone mentioned in a previous review, it's like Call of Evil (to combine two titles) with the nonstop action and shooting, which is good in some regards and an insult to the series in other regards.
I completed Leon's story, and I'm halfway through Chris' story. Leon's story was mostly an insult to his RE 2 roots, although I was glad to see that he briefly reunited with people from RE 2 (I won't spoil it). Chris' scenario is actually much funner to me, but I can't shake the feeling that this game should have remained faithful to its survival/atmospheric origins.
For me, the controls were very difficult to adapt to at first because I'm accustomed to survival and roleplaying games, but by the time I completed Leon's quest and moved on to Chris I was such a bada-- that I felt as if the background music should have been something from the Django Unchained shootout: ""AM I WRONG 'CAUSE I WANNA GET IT ON 'TIL I DIE?!""
Slaughter. Total slaughter.
As other people have mentioned, the sudden deaths that are unavoidable such as a giant hurling a car at me because I didn't move 20 feet in the two seconds that were allotted to me are my #2 complaint.

It's probably a comment that you've already read many times: it's an above average video game yet a below average Resident Evil game.

I wish that I could rank it 2.7 of 5 stars. It's just slightly above average overall.

UPDATE: I'm currently playing Chris' end boss, which looks like a Mass Effect 2 ripoff. Anyway, Capcom should be absolutely ashamed of itself for these moronic camera angles, which make it almost impossible to move him around effectively. At one crucial point he isn't even visible to me. How the hell can I control a character I can't even see?"
429690,3,Certainly cheaper than other gaming keyboards. The shift key kept falling off though. Returned.
361978,3,"The 'skin' on the right side of my controller separated and eventually came off completely, so now I have original Squid Grip on the left side, and just foam on the right. Honestly I feel like the foam only side is more absorbent than the 'skin' side, but I would have just preferred it stayed together in one piece.

Overall, I like having something on the controller over nothing at all. The original hard plastic promoted sweat to the point my fingers would get 'pruney' from all the moisture, but these allow me to play as long with very limited moisture production. Maybe just the foam padding part is all that's really necessary for a good working design."
167460,3,"Instead of creating a new game all they did is repaint COD4 with WWII paint and released it. Every thing is WWII replacement. Air strikes are replaced with dogs, etc. Zombie survival is not as much as fun as R2 or Gears co-op. Also the game single player mission is really short. If you have played COD games before and can play without dying; it can be finished in one sitting."
404469,3,"I was disappointed in this headset. They are wireless as they claim and that aspect of them works perfectly. My complaint is the sound. I previously used Turtle Beach XO One headphones wired to my controller, and the sound produced from those is nearly identical, if not better than this headset. That being said, the build quality on this set is far superior. Overall, it is a decent set of headphones, but, if you're looking for a more immersion experience, save up and buy the surround headphones Turtle Beach offers, they are some of the best you can get."
171140,3,"This is a good ole FF game. Has an odd flow though.

The first 20 hours are very driven, absolutely on rails. There are as many cut scenes as there is game play. Basically the first 20 hours is a playable movie/tutorial. Then you reach a point that is more open world and VERY difficult. Unfortunately it's so difficult I lost interest a bit. Hoping I get back to this soon. I really want to after investing so much time.

The paradigm system used in fights now is very interesting. Since your party is only 3 members, but you have 6 to choose from, it gives you the ability to have characters with multiple roles that can change on the fly. The combo system is also fun. Over all it's a good game. I just hit a really hard section and got bored. The beginning had such a long ramp up I got easily frustrated. Also because of the way the early parts of the game worked, it was hard to do a lot of farming to beef up skill levels. Now I'm at a difficult section where I need to farm and can't win enough fights to make that useful.

I expect a full play through will be 40+ hours. I don't know if I have the free time anymore to invest in an RPG like that."

463443,3,"It's a good game whenever I'm able to play it. The product arrived as stated with the cover art, manual and all, but the disc was all scratched up. Whenever I put it in to play it, the main menu screen would load up, but an error kept popping up that said ""Please re-insert disc"". I even went to a local gaming store to get the disc resurfaced and the problem still persisted. The only way I was able to get past the error message was to keep opening and closing the lid on my PS2 so that it would read the disc. The problem only happens during the main menu screen and during the car select screen, other than that, the game plays fine. That is the only thing I hate about purchasing used games online, because you can't check the disc, even if the seller posts a picture of it, you still can't tell if it has tiny scratches on it, you just have to take their word for it. At least when you go to a gaming store, you can ask the cashier if you could check the disc before purchasing it. That is why I always prefer going to a gaming store rather than ordering games online, but there are a bunch of games that are very rare that you won't find in gaming stores, so what other choice does one have?"

I guess they were worried about getting in trouble, like getting a bad name, racist issues or whatever. You know how some people are, they would start something and I guess that's what they're thinking. Anyways, the original Wolfenstein 3D is classic, just like Doom. The SNES version is in no comparison but it's still worth playing. This game is pretty rare now. If you beat Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War, you will be able to play the original."
119554,3,"2008. After another stellar holiday season and the strongest first-party releases to date now in the marketplace, no one can deny the status of the Wii as the current contender for worldwide ""winner"" of this generation's console war. Despite this, most third-party publishers are content with porting massive amounts of trashy PS2 games and tacking on waggle controls. They often tell gaming news sources that this strategy is due to the fact ""people only buy Nintendo games on Nintendo consoles.""

One third party that isn't afraid to push new content onto the console is Sega. With new games in the Sonic and NiGHTS franchises, along with ports(both good and bad), Sega sees potential in the 'cheap PS2 dressed up like a Mac'. Fortunately for light-gun afficionados everywhere, HotD2&3:R is a GOOD port, and a perfect fit for the Wii's control scheme (cheap Zapper excluded).

That being said, you basically get what you're expecting. Arcade-perfect versions of House of the Dead 2 and 3, along with a few extra modes tacked on for good measure. And when I say arcade-perfect, I mean it. There's no Wii-specific watering down here, which is a welcome change from something like Ghost Squad. Sadly, I was actually surprised by the crispness of the graphics, despite their simplicity when compared against today's standards. There are a few unexpected framerate issues with HotD3, but nothing nearly as painful as playing the Xbox version on the 360. No noticeable issues are present in HotD2.

The games control very well with the Wii remote, although surprisingly there appears to be a bit of lag between pointing at the screen and having the cursor go where it needs to. Both HotD2 and 3 are MUCH harder than I remember in the arcades, and reloading quickly is actually somewhat of a chore, despite the accuracy of the controls. This is a small disappointment, though a noticeable one.

The cheesy voice acting synonymous with the series remains intact here, and fans of the HotD games wouldn't have it any other way. Interestingly, without the loud beeps, bleeps, and blaring music of the arcade, the voices are actually MUCH, MUCH cheesier than I was expecting. Music is mostly forgettable and 100% arcade authentic.

The extra modes present in the game pretty much match point-for-point with the DC version for HotD2. HotD3 contains an extra mode containing an option for a melee attack along with a time attack mode. In my opinion, more work could have been done to add additional modes to HotD3, because it seems pretty barren in comparison to HotD2.

Overall, for a ported compilation on the Wii, this game is surprisingly solid and well worth the $30 price tag. For those who are fans of the arcade versions, picking this one up is a no-brainer, as the control on the Wii goes hand-in-hand with rail shooters, and the port quality on both games is good. Additional options and modes would be greatly appreciated, but given its budget price, it's really difficult to complain too much. Thanks, Sega.

Rating System: Who needs stars and numbers? I'm all about the otaku emoticons!

*-* = Amazing
^-^ = Good
-_- = Fair
T_T = Poor

Graphics: -_-
HotD2 is a perfect arcade/Dreamcast port. HotD3 is nearly perfect but suffers from scattered framerate issues that weren't present in the arcade version (however, not nearly as problematic as the Xbox version of HotD3 when played in a 360). That said, the lack of widescreen and 480p support is a glaring flaw. All Wii games should be required to support these options. Also, these games are a few years old, and are beginning to show their age. Red blood wasn't taken out (a relief - considering the preview videos showed the green blood) and can be turned on in the options menu.

Sound: ^-^
Cheesy voice acting is here in full-force, along with all the sounds you'd expect from the arcade versions. Music is arcade-perfect as well. Not particularly memorable, but recognizable nonetheless.

Replayability: ^-^
Additional credits and difficulty settings open up if you perform well or poorly. Completing both HotD2 and HotD3 opens up an additional mode for HotD3. Extra modes (including Time Attack, Boss Attack, and Original) are plentiful in HotD2 but are seriously lacking in HotD3. Both games can be beaten in under an hour if you have enough credits, but that won't be the case at first.

Downloadable Content: N/A
Wii game. No DLC planned.

Fun Factor: -_-
These are arcade ports, and therefore are more fun to blast through with a friend. The additional modes (especially Original mode on HotD2) add a lot to the game as well. My only complaint is the length of each game (especially when compared with RE:UC), but given these are ports rather than a new original game, it can't be helped.

Overall: ^-^
Not bad, Sega. Not bad at all.

468139,3,"The movie to game adaptation of the Golden Compass is a fairly enjoyable experience. Graphics are decent, gameplay is solid but I would most recommend it for fans of the film. Had I not seen the film first, some of the concepts would not be clearly explained within the game itself (which is understandable as the game is not the right place to get into deep philosophical discussions on religion). For achievement hunters, achievements are fairly attainable although you will need a symbol guide to avoid lengthy trial and error during gameplay. Solid if not spectacular game."
53903,3,"has some serious flaws. There's no New Game+ (like in Final Fantasy X-2) which means you have to learn abilities all over again. This is probably why the designers made huge levels with tons of enemies so you can collect lots of Xperience points necessary for leveling up your characters and see their Xtreme powers (although I finished the game without unlocking the other abilities so I don't know how they look in battle). You could, however, train in the Danger Room if you want more XP but it gets boring eventually. Some people say only the characters you use gain XP, but I think it's wrong. I found that characters which I rarely use in the game also gain XP so no one is left behind. The AI can be very stupid at times - characters fall off cliffs; and when you try to fly an ally and go back to pick up another one, the first one will follow you and fall down again (best thing is to use iceman or magma to make bridges). It's not always easy to change team since save points are not so frequent and this can get very annoying during timed missions. I don't mind the cel-shaded graphics as they work well during gameplay (no slowing down even when it gets very chaotic). Lastly, load times are quite long but at least you get to see some cool load screens."
216527,3,"I am a BIG fan of the Biggest Loser and when I saw this game, I decided to get it along with the WII.  I love doing the exercises, but this game could have been WAY better!  So you create your profile, and you can chose your own exercise program or let them chose for you.  I exercise with it 3 days a week 40 minutes a day. You can change it if you want to.  You also do exercises on days that you aren't doing a training exercise or you can do a challenge.  Theres just too many glitches in this game though.

I was originally only training with Jillian, and then today I decided Bob and Jillian. Why for the full 40 minutes did I only train with Bob?  The WII balance board...why I really like using it, it gets to be a real pain in the neck.  Move your balance board out of the way...move your balance board into position.  Sometimes the game even tells me to move my balance board out of the way, put the WII remote into my right hand.....and then it tells me to move my balance board into position!  Then it tells you to put the WII remote into your pocket which I don't have I have to like stick it down my shorts(disgusting I know but what am I supposed to do)?  The remote doesnt pick up all the moves so Bob and Jillian are yelling at you even though you are doing the exercises.

I am not training with Jillian anymore because I don't see the point. You are training with Jillian and yet Bob is doing the voice overs telling you how to do the exercises.

Today Bob was telling me to put the WII remote into my right hand while the exercise was already starting.  I get up to all 5 bars and then Bob tells me that I didn't do so well.  Then I only get like 2 or 3 bars and Bob is telling me I did great.  Also like I said I work out for 40 minutes, but it takes an hour, so make sure you have enough time.

It is pretty cool how you feel you are right at the ranch.  Its so real.

This game needs some BIG improvements."

450851,3,This is a decent game but the Nintendo 64 version blows it completely out of the water. I mean I could really use a combat simulator to play when Im stuck in the main game but still there are some great action scenes. The graphics and sound are terrible though. I suggest you skip this one unless you're a die hard Perfect Dark fan. You should get Super Mario Deluxe instead at least that is more fun.

452647,3,This game was pretty good. It had some pretty good jump scares and it had very good level design. However the story was not very good. It was very predictable and parts of it didn't make sense. The voice acting was also pretty bad. But what saved the game was the actually gameplay and the cinematic scenes. The cinematic scence were beatiful and stunning and the gameplay was so much fun. I do recommend buying this game if you are a lover of survival horror don't mind running away and hiding from your enemies.
360085,3,"The Good: Great visuals and facial animations, characters really stand out

The Bad: Boring gameplay, every case plays out the exact same way, not much in a way of suspense

The Sherlock Holmes adventure series has had its ups and downs. If the story isn't up to par with the show or books its clunky controls or poor gameplay. Crimes and Punishments sounds darker than it really is. Honestly the game is more about the characters shining through and less about the crimes or gameplay.

The game starts out surprisingly cinematic for a point and click. Watson is dodging Holmes gunfire in his study as he ducks and weaves between furniture. It shows just how more nuanced the series is and just how much it has grown. Among the four cases you solve neither of them are all that interesting. The game tries to get you thinking big mysteries but honestly the dull way of going about the cases keeps you from really caring.

The gameplay consists of walking around areas and finding anything you can click on. Some items can be examined, certain characters can be profiled where you scan the character in slow motion to find interesting points. There are various puzzles as well but these seem to be half broken since pieces won't snap in place and various objects won't register. Surrounding that is figuring out where to go and then solving clues to bring the whole thing together. Hopping back and forth between areas gets old especially with the long load times. The character interactions are somewhat interesting and I couldn't help but smile at Holmes sarcastic way of going about things. Other than this the game offers a dull experience of the detective mystery of old.

I played through the first two cases and honestly started losing interest. Each case has the same exact way of being solved. Wander around an area and pixel hunt, interview characters, run back and forth between areas and rinse and repeat. The game looks really good and the facial animations are surprisingly well done. Adventure game fanatics may love this game, but anyone else wanting a bit of action or suspense like in the Telltale adventure games won't find it here."
27317,3,"I'd like to keep this review short since I'm low on time, but anyway...
I found this to be a good game, but it was kind of a let down after playing Metal Gear Solid 2.  Its just not in the same league.  If you have a PS2 and don't have MGS2, that is the game you want to buy.  After MGS2, buy this one."

***UPDATE 9.15.2014***
-----------------------
After returning this bundle and grabbing the XBOX One with Kinect, I will admit the XBOX One is a much better, more fluid and overall better experience in every aspect. While The $100 was hard to swallow for me, especially I have ZERO desire play any Kinect enabled games, the XB1 with the Kinect is just better. I love the voice commands and multitasking with the Kinect is just exactly what I thought the XB1 should/would be. I am not disappointed by it at all.

Keep in mind, if you get the XB1 w/ Kinect it has an ACTIVE MIC which will be on and let other people hear you in an online game, such as Madden. It annoyed me so I had to disable this feature when playing online via the Settings.

Again, if you get an XBOX One, I HIGHLY recommend getting it with the Kinect as the experience is much better. I am a happy camper now.

-----------------------
***UPDATE 9.2.2014***
-----------------------
I decided to return this bundle and get an XB1 with Kinnect bundle as the XB1 experience without the Kinnect is vastly subpar, mediocre, inferior, however you wish to word it. I will get use to the Metro style OS even though its not my favorite. I will not consider a PS4 because I have been using an Xbox 360 for years and all my friends on are Xbox.

As for the graphics, I did try a few other games and they graphics ARE better than 360 without a doubt. Some games, like COD Ghosts MARGINALLY look better but that is due to the Developers not making the game 1080p NOT because of the Xbox One capabilities. Some games look AMAZING, some, meh not so much.

I am going to leave my review 3-stars because without the Kinnect, the experience is just horrible IN MY OPINION. Do yourself a favor, get the Kinnect bundle.

----------------------------------
COMING FROM PS3 to 360 to XB1
----------------------------------
I was an original PS3 user until PSN when out for 3-4 months year back. At that point I bought a 360 and never looked back. I currently have a 360 250GB Slim with no issues and I still love it. I love the 360 interface/software and how easy it is to navigate and use, even as a first time user going from a PS3 to a 360 many years ago I didn't find it hard to navigate and get to know the 360 interface. Now I love it. I love a lot of the games, have played a lot of games but mainly I still play Madden 25, COD Ghosts and COD MW3 (yes MW3 still) most frequent. I am a HUGE fan of Madden series, even though they usually suck each year and I pay $60 for roster updates like an idiot conformist. For my birthday, I decided to buy an Xbox One and just snag the Madden 15 bundle.

Before I start, I first want to say I did NOT assume this came with a physical copy of Madden 15, anyone whom might have thought that is ignorant, no offense. To sum up my experience so far, I am still on the fence about the Xbox One altogether so far.

--------
SETUP
--------
The setup was easy and quick. That was good. I hooked it up to a Samsung 55"" LED SmartTV via HDMI. Very easy and intuitive guide that walks you through setup.

---------------------
INTERFACE - METRO
---------------------
The next thing I noticed was the PATHETIC Metro 8.1 style interface/software, its just not as easy and far more cumbersome to navigate compared to the 360. Microsoft, seriously, Windows 8 or 8.1 is a joke, it's more of a joke on a non-touchscreen device, such as a TV... sometimes I wonder if companies ever get the general public's opinion on things before release (they don't).

If you're familiar and like Windows 8/8.1 this won't be an issue for you, other wise, it's different and far less intuitive on a non-touchscreen.

------------
GRAPHICS
------------
Am I missing something? I have an HDTV with the XB1 setup via HDMI, I even tried a different HDMI cable than the one that was included, but the graphics, well really NOT that impressed, not initially at least. Madden 15 looks marginally better than Madden 25 on 360. COD Ghosts looks IDENTICAL on XB1 compared to 360 especially since on the XB1 it runs at 720p (wow, pathetic). Titanfal, well that looks GOOD at best. It does NOT blow me out the water like many claim. Sometimes I wonder about peoples hyped up claims.

I have not played any other games, anybody have any recommends?

--------------------------
KINNECT or KINNECTLESS
--------------------------
I've never owned the Kinnect on my 360 and I opted not to get it for the XB1, but already I can tell its far less integrated without it, which is a down fall because I believe I have 0 use for a Kinnect. $399 without the Kinnect is a better deal, still not the best and it's still overpriced IMO, but at least it came with a $60-$70 game for free.

I don't need or want to talk to my XB1 but without doing so, so many of the marketed features are useless or extremely dumbed down. Very disappointing IMO. That's what I get for being poor and too ignorant to buy it with the Kinnect.

--------------------
HDMI PASSTHROUGH
--------------------
I did hook up my Comcast Motorala Cable box to the XB1, well without the Kinnect and it's IR (Infrared) capabilities, this is almost useless as it won't send any IR commands from the XB1 to the cable box without an IR cable or Kinnect. I would have some minor use for the Kinnect after all, oh well, I don't need to snap into TV while gaming. BTW, the snap feature is actually pretty cool all in all.

--------------
IN THE END
--------------
In the end, all I really want to do is game and the graphics have YET to impress me for a new generation console as much as I THOUGHT they would. Maybe give it more time? Maybe my vision will get better? Ha. Maybe I need to give it more time and try more games. Anybody have any recommends?

I guess at the end of the day I could have done more research on the Kinnect-less Xbox One bundle. As of now, I am disappointed more so than I thought I would. I am on the fence and I may even return the XB1 soon if I cannot get into it. I will keep trying the XB1 for another week or so and decide at that point if I want to keep it or return it.

I will update my review in a week or so."
213468,3,"Why do creators of sequel change the best aspects of the original and make it worse?

The original Resistence was a great game. It was fun and addicting. Its weapons were great.

I wish the creators had kept the weapons and their functionality. Plus, this game is buggy. Even after the 1.5 upgrade, the weapons don't change properly and some of the chapters have issues (doors don't open when they should etc).

This isn't a bad game. It is a very average game.

I've never played Resistence 2. But if that game is worse than this, then Resistence 2 must be a downer indeed.

Maybe I had high expectations. What I am sure of is this game doesn't meet them.

Overall, this game is OK."

362249,3,"Well there are good and bad things about the Playstation TV first off it plays most PS Vita games some of the games aren't supported yet hopefully they will patch it soon.  The unit it self is very tiny so you can place it anywhere you want and it does have WIFI on it but you also have the option to add a LAN line to it for people who want to go wired instead also it is Bluetooth compatible so Playstation Dual Shock 3 and 4 controllers can be used however on the Dual Shock 4 controller you can't use the touch pad or the headphone jack just won't work with the PSTV.  Graphics of the unit if very sketchy the only options are 1080I ,720P and 480P most of the games i have tried won't go to 1080I and there is a reason one reason is that the game does not support it and the second reason is that the game it self looks like crap on a big screen you gotta remember that most of these games were made for the PS Vita system on a 5"" Screen so the games on PSTV are really just blown up and that's it but i can say some games look really good on here well other game like the older ones need a bit more help and tweaking. Another thing is that you could play other games from different systems like the PS 1,PS 2,PS 3,PS 4,PSP well yes and no this is the thing everybody thought that if you have a Playstation Plus Account you could get all the free games from PS 3 and PS 4 and play it on the PSTV and its probably the reason to buying the PSTV well your wrong you have to remember its just a PS VITA.  They do have the ripoff APP called Playstion NOW yes it is a ripoff you can play PS 1,PS 2,PS 3 haven't seen any PS4 yet the reason why its a ripoff lets just say starting price is $4.99 for just 4 Hrs and it does play the games well and there are a selected few that you can play on the PSTV.  I won't go in to remote play for the PS4 don't really use it for PSTV.  Final Thoughts about the PSTV well all I can say that it is just starting out hopefully there will be patches and fixes in the weeks to come but if your looking for a small compact and home use PS VITA get the real PS VITA  PSTV to me is Still in beta and needs a lot of work but it does what it suppose to do bring PS VITA to the big screen.

Good:
1) Brings PS Vita to big screen TV
2) very tiny can place anywhere
3) plays most games very well
4) Blue tooth compatible so dual shock 3&4 controllers can be used
5) Wire or Wireless
6) future updates

Bad:
1) most games won't go to 1080I (graphics need work)
2) most games are not compatible
3) just a chopped up version of a PS VITA with a HDMI
4) only way to play other games it through ripoff APP Playstation NOW
5) future updates (they should have tested everything before releasing the unit)"
146656,3,I got this game as a gift from someone and I'm not a big fan of it. I played it a couple times and it's not too good. I highly recommend you play Wii Tennis from Wii sports than this game.
7667,3,"A somewhat entertaining video game to pull out of your cartridge stack to play and help kill thirty, maybe forty-five minutes with. Out of the twenty Nintendo 64 games that I own, I play this one probably every other month or so. Good graphics to say the least. Also like the music that's played when I put this cartridge in for a race. Sounds very much like that of The Orb or possibly Aphex Twin. Used price for the video game simply cannot be beat."
139111,3,"Count my husband and myself as diehard Diablo fans.  In fact, huge Blizzard fans.  It truly pains me to say that after so many years of anticipation for D3, that I wish I didn't buy my copy or my husband's as well.  $120 gone like that.  I now wish that I would have ordered it off of amazon so I could return it, but I had to have it right when it came out and went to a store that doesn't accept open software.  Figures.  My husband used the guest pass key and then paid directly to Blizzard itself, so I doubt there is any way to refund that as well.  Anyway, live and learn.  Sometimes it's more costly than others.

Let's start with the things that I liked.  It's finally out.  After many, many delays on release dates and preorder options that were made available all over the place only to be cancelled, it is now in stores.  Hallelujah.  Of course, there truly is no longer a reason to actually preorder a game since availability on release dates are no longer an issue.  You can just about buy a computer game anywhere now.

The graphics are excellent.  If you enjoy cinematics and story, Blizzard is never one to disappoint.  The music is good as well as the characters voices.  The gamer's point of view is exactly the same as it's predecessors.  Point and click which is perfect for people like me.  I get motion sickness off of 3D games and playing from the first person point of view, so this is actually a game that I'm able to play.

The main reason that I enjoy the Diablo games is the multiplayer.  My husband and I enjoy playing together.  It's a great way to get our ""geek"" on.  Ha!

On to the negatives, which are many for us.  We have played for a week now, and after an initial enjoying of the game, by around level 15 or so, we really started noticing things that were bugging us.

First of all, we receive an error most times we attempt to log on.  It usually will take us about 5 or 6 attempts and finally we seem to ""slip"" through.  Our computers are both up to date driver-wise and are completely capable of running games that have much higher requirements than D3, and are quite confident it's not ""operator"" error on our part.  Granted some games can have issues when they are first released, Blizzard is usually quick to correct them.  Reading all over the forums and various other sites online, this error is quite common and is very frustrating.  Not something you want when you spend $60 on a game, let alone the $120 we spent.

Blizzard has managed to take away some of the things that made Diablo 2 fun and different from other games.  I see it as a damned if you do, damned if you don't kind of thing.  I understand some of the whys, but am not happy with the execution.  For example, in multiplayer games, each player receives a drop.  You don't share gold or have to fight other players for your items.  Yes, this does keep you from having some punk level 3 character stealing your high level drop from a boss, but it also takes the challenge away when playing with your friends.

Power leveling is now a thing of the past.  You can't rush other characters through.  You can't create your own game names anymore.

Town portals are practically useless now that waypoints and automatic save checkpoints are a thing of the past.  You also can't cast a town portal in boss fights, or at least we weren't in the couple we have tried so far.  You also don't have to buy town portals anymore since it's just a capability you have automatically.  Very little strategy is needed in your game play.  If you die, you don't have to go back for your corpse.  You just materialize at the last checkpoint.  Yes, you have 10% damage after level 10, but other than that, you are good to go.  Once again, no challenge.  You are left right by the waypoint, or you can town portal (if you have to, which is rare since you are usually since most checkpoints are near the waypoints anyway) and repair your stuff.  Like I said, town portals are worthless.

Deckard Cain is in the game, but doesn't identify stuff for you.  Not a biggie, since you can do it yourself already.  Just right-click on the item.  Most things are identified already, but for the few that aren't, super easy.  It's just one less task in a game that you don't have to do, but when you start taking away all these ""trivial"" things away from gameplay, they do add up.

Another of our biggest complaints is that almost EVERYTHING is magical.  You find blue and yellow items like crazy.  There is no struggle in finding weapons and armor for your characters.  Rings drop like manna from heaven.  It's insane.  You are no longer subjected to having to wear or use items that aren't exactly what you want.  You have no need for items that vendors provide and even those are magical.  Instead, the rare drops are actually regular weapons and items with no magical capabilities whatsoever.  And I have yet to find an item drop that I wasn't able to use immediately.  No need to save it for later in hopes to build up to being able to use it.  Diablo 3 has very much become an ""everybody wins"" game.  It's like Blizzard is patting us all on the head and handing us a little trophy just for playing the game.  Give me a break.

I like the idea that you are able to change your skill set during the game because then you can alter your fighting techniques.  I currently play a barbarian, so I can alter my points depending on whether I am fighting a singular boss or a mob of monsters.  However, it also takes away the challenge of the game.  Part of the fun was picking the way you want your character to be played, and you had to commit.  This is perfect for those that want to straddle both sides of the fence.  Not so much for me.  I like to make mistakes and then be able to use what I learned to start a new character later.  It really adds to the replay-ability of the game.

Points are added with each level, so you have no need to concentrate your points in where you want you character to excel.  Once again, there is no need to work for something.  Everything is handed directly to you.  For those that really enjoy playing a game, it's like they might as well have just played the entire game for you.  It's foolproof.  It's like playing a game on easy so you don't actually have to play.

I'm sure there are other things that I don't like that I'm just not able to think of right now.  Should have kept a running list next to the computer.  Like I said earlier, I hate that I'm am this disappointed on a game that is 12 years past the last one.  With the capabilities of computers and technology in general, this game feels at least 6 years past it's prime.  It's not challenging.  Yes, my character will die on occasion, but there is no strategy needed.  Everything is done for you.  For a game to be rated mature, it should have some challenging gameplay that requires more than what could be done from an 8 year old.  The chances that I replay this game, despite having the choice of other characters, are very slim.  My husband is away most of the week working, so we were going to play this together at night when he is away from home, but we may just have to go back to World of Warcraft or I may have to resort to playing Starcraft 2 with him (ick)."
161391,3,My son loves it
330276,3,"The game looks and plays great.  It's visually stunning and I have to be honest, I thought Forza 4 was awesome and this is even better.  However, I do not like what they've done to Forza 5.  Forza 4 came with a bunch of tracks and a ton of cars.  This comes with  less tracks and very few cars.  But don't worry, they CREATED a ton of cars, you just can't have them for free.  But they'll be happy to sell them to you!  Forza 4 also had car packs so car packs aren't new (and I bought every one of them for Forza 4) but it looks like they purposely kept the number and type of cars to a minimum so you'd have to buy more to enjoy the game.  Had they lowered the price of the game and you only paid for the cars you wanted in a way to save money, it'd have been a great idea.  After all, very few people drive all of the cars in the game.  They also stopped rewarding drivers with new cars as they progressed through the driver levels.  But once you finally have paid for them to be in the game it takes 10 times longer to level up and earn enough credits to put the car in your garage, essentially forcing you to pay cash again to use them.

Rent it. Play it. Love it. Just don't buy it new because you'll be supporting this new Forza business move.  It's a shame too because I love Forza and despite the money grab it's a great game just as you expect from Turn 10."
200583,3,"Have you ever heard of the PC game Hospital Hustle?  If you have played that game then this game is pretty much the same game, except on DS not PC.  I really like time management games, but this game is just alittle slow and boring.  The graphics on some DS games are really bad because the screen is just so small, and that is the case with this game as well.  The graphics are really cheesy, the setup of the game is really slow overall, and you just keep doing the same thing over and over again.  I think if the game was alittle faster and the game changed alittle it might be somewhat more enjoyable.  I liked the PC version of Hospital Hustle it got alittle repeative as well, but the game sped up as you advanced so it was alittle more fun than this one.

Overall the game isn't bad, but if I knew what I know now I would not go back and purchase the game again.  I would save my $20.00 for another game.  I've played the game for about 35 minutes so far, so maybe as I advance in the game it will speed itself up alittle.  If it doesn't I am not sure I will make it through completing the game.  If anything changes I will edit and update my review, but as of now I would have to say that buying this game is probably not a good investment unless of course you like games that are alittle slow in speed and not complicated or challenging."
363788,3,"Okay game, if you like being slaughtered and like having a million buttons and options."
166935,3,"I usually don't like platformers, but I took a chance on this game after IGN raved about it.  The result is a mixed bag: the platforming action is enjoyable, but I find the combat engine to be unresponsive and annoying.

The heart of the Prince of Persia series - going back to the franchise's side-scrolling days - has always been an agile, acrobatic hero as opposed to a muscle-bound brute.  The newest iteration stays true to that formula, and the hero, who isn't really a ""prince"" at all but a Han Solo type rogue, has all the moves from the Sands of Time trilogy and more, and it's really cool to pretend that I'm the one doing the wall runs, ceiling runs, and rebound jumps to scale impossible heights.

One IGN reviewer complained that the hero's abrasive personality really annoyed him, but I found the opposite to be true.  While the hero is a selfish mercenary-type who helps Elika only because he's forced to, his witty back-and-forth banter with her is entertaining and serves as a nice diversion from the usual platforming - ""Run, jump die, repeat, run, jump, die, repeat.  I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.""  It's a good thing that Elika has the intelligence, wit, and (sometimes) sarcasm to go toe-to-toe with the hero and hold her own; this is a credit to the scriptwriters.

Elika is a wonderful AI character.  She is the first AI partner I've had in a game whom I don't have to constantly babysit (yes, I'm looking at you, Fallout 3!  And you, Saints Row 2!).  In the platforming segments, she can perform every action you can, so there's never a worry that she'll fall behind (I'm looking at you, Silent Hill 4!).  She never bumps into you or obstructs your path.  I also thank Ubisoft for Elika's ""compass power"" which shows me how I can reach my next destination (unlike in The Sands of Time, where I once searched for my next jump for over 2 hours - no joke).

The fact that Elika saves the hero whenever he's about to die has brought some criticism from players, but I say this is a good thing; when you die in a game, you simply load the most recent save file and try again, right?  So having Elika rescue you saves time and makes the gameplay smoother.  But to encourage players to not be too reckless, Ubisoft has included an Achievement which is unlocked if Elika saves you less than 100 times in a single play-through.

So if I like this game so much, why did I give it only 3 stars?  One reason is that it gets real repetitive real fast (again, it's ""Run, jump die, repeat, run, jump, die, repeat"").  The other big reason is the combat system.  If Ubisoft was going to give me only four enemy types in the whole game, they could have at least varied up the enemies from one encounter to the next.  For example, fighting the Concubine feels exactly the same whether I'm fighting her for the first time or the fourth time.  She employs the same tactics, same patterns, same everything, so I too have to do the same things over and over (since there is only one type of attack that damages her).

The timing of hitting buttons during combat also proved problematic: I hold Right Trigger to block, then release, then hit X to attack, but nothing happens on the first press.  So I lose a fraction of a second there, which is just long enough for the enemy to hit me.  This happens time and time again!  Enemies also have the uncanny ability to interrupt my combos, but I can't interrupt theirs.  Whenever I'm on the offensive, pushing the enemy back, he will somehow miraculously interrupt my combo and instantly turn the tables.  This feels so unbelievably cheap and frustrating that I have to keep from throwing my controller into the wall.

So the end result?  Only a ""meh"" rather than a ""wow.""  If the monotony of the platforming segments were broken up with more variety, and if the combat system had been tightened up, we could have had a real winner here."
221858,3,"I really enjoyed the first release of ""Hot Wheels: Beat That"" on DS that become a surprising favorite considering that it's most likely aimed at kids, but turned out to be a really fun game for all ages. I didn't enjoy ""Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5"" but that hasn't stopped me from being anxious to play this 3rd game in the Hot Wheels franchise for the nDS.

Perhaps ""Activision"" dropped the ball a little in the sequel to a great game; however there was a major bug in the original that prevented anyone from achieving all the goals. Now THQ have taken over, and given the 'Hot Wheels' racing games a new look and different feel to the original two Activision titles.

So now we know this 3rd game is not made by the original DS HotWheels makers, is it any good to those who loved the original? Sure it is, but expect a whole different ball game to what you where used to... if you never played the original, I recommend you do, even with that bug in it to prevent you from completing it.

This time around, it is mostly just racing to the finish line; forget about the power-ups like blasters, mines and rockets etc... They are not in this game! This is a completely different experience on many levels for the Hot Wheels gamer.

The first thing I noticed once I started racing was;  In ""Beat That"" you had an atmosphere where you felt like you where racing on an actual Hot Wheels racing set-up inside some kids bedroom, or whatever location... in this game, say goodbye to all of that... there is no pencil barriers, no rubbers to bounce into, no paper clip thingies, no feeling like you are in a room, this is more a racing game atmosphere then the feeling of racing a true Hot Wheels track setup... also, when in the air on jumps, you will not be able to spin around and do the stunts, which is something I miss a lot in this game, but oh well, it is what it is now, and there is nothing we can do about it.

But does that mean it's a bad thing? No, it's actually a very good racing game, and one of the best you can find on DS, and I say that having played just about every racing game the DS has to offer. It's not THE best (Sideswiped is), but it's pretty gosh darn good!

At first you may feel the racing is a little slow, but like a lot of other racing titles on the DS, the designers have most likely done this so you start off slow, but as you earn `tokens' in the game, more and more vehicles become available to use, and they can also be upgraded to increase their standard default values. You can increase the vehicles performances by selecting the vehicle, then clicking a spanner like icon above it, and you can increase ""top speed"", ""Acceleration"", ""Handling"" & ""Boost (Nitro)"". However, you must collect blue tokens on the race courses to obtain enough of these to increase things (2 or 3 tokens per single upgrade, and around about 4 in max total) Also, depending on what vehicle you use, provided you have access to it at the time being, some cars even maxed out won't be as good as some of the much faster vehicles you will eventually unlock.

So, to skip back a little now; upon boot up of the game, you get the annoying company logos and things, which are annoying that you cannot skip and just get to the menu within 30 seconds of booting the game.  Once you are on the main menu, you have the option to go do the main thing and compete in all the events. Second option is Multiplayer that I have not participated in. Thirdly is the ""Track Builder"" where you can go and design your own tracks to race on (fairly simple, but could use a lot of work to make it more fun). And Fourthly, the game ""options"" which are the standard audio, music levels, data options and surprisingly a password screen that might hold some nice secrets for future playing.

Back to the racing aspect of the game; there are four island looking icons on the touch screen for you to choose what event you want to be a part of. At first 3 of them are locked, but as you race and earn your tokens, they open up. You can then participate in what events you have access to. So select your event, then it's time to choose a car. You start off with only one car to begin with, but go out and win a race, and you will begin earning what you need to unlock more and more cars/vehicles. The vehicles are in 3 screens of categories; ""Roadster"", ""Racer"", ""Off Roader"", ""Muscle Car"" & ""Supercar"".  Unless there is a few hidden ones I have no unlocked, there is a total of 24 cars/vehicles to choose from varying from Hot Rods, Cruisers, Regular looking thing, Irregular looking things, and a Formula 1 with each vehicle having its own attributes.

Once you begin racing, you can participate in 3 different kinds of races. The first being a regular 3 lap race. The second being ""elimination"" which means you race 3 laps, and if you are in 4th by the time the first 3 cars go over the finish line, that vehicle is out of the race. Basically, just place first to win. The 3rd event I hated at first until I realized what I was doing wrong... I thought it was a time race, but it's just a barrier race where you need to drive into all the targets showing on the track and get to the finish-line without missing ANY of the targets. So don't make the mistake I did and thought I had to put the pedal to the metal and race it, you can just cruise along, but just don't miss anything and run out of time. There is also a ""token run"" where you have a limited time to just drive around a course and collect as many tokens as you can for car upgrades. It's a bonus game pretty much.

Controls
The controls are pretty straight forward for a racing game on DS, or a controller for that matter. You have your accelerator, brake and a nitro button. Steering is controlled with the direction pad, so it's pretty much like most other racing games, so the stylus is never needed for the racing portion of the events. The stylus is only needed for the options and selection menus.
The control response is excellent. No complaints about it, but it will be up to you to find which car/vehicle you can handle the best... but no matter what you select, expect to hit the wall on a few turns unless you get used to that brake... which I never did, but hitting the walls doesn't slow you down so much that every other car zooms by you and it takes too long to build up speed again... so it's not an annoyance like other games, and you should find the controls are not your problem if you do lose a race (which doesn't happen that often, beleive it or not... well, if your decent at these kind of games anyway)

Graphics
The graphics are not the greatest for this game. I think Activision did a better job in car detailing and coarse visual with ""Beat That"", but where THQ have lacked in the graphics department, they have made up in speed and response making an overall great game that you will (or might not) enjoy playing so much that the graphics are not worried about.

Sound
The sound of the vehicles vary from one to the other, they sound good enough to me. The music however is rather low in this game, however it is pretty much generic rock music, so it's just there to hear, but not listen to. No real problem with that for many people I wouldn't think. If for some reason you would prefer real music with vocals to alternative and rock songs while you race, try ""Dirt 2"".

Cons
Now onto the things that bugged me in this game;

Load Time
First off, the load times are annoying. Between every event, you will see the same old logo of a fire emblem. I really got sick of looking at this after a while, and the amount of time it takes to load. It's between 7 to 12 seconds, maybe longer sometimes.

Saving Data
At the end of each race, or when you change something, the game does an auto-save. I really got sick to death of the game telling me to not turn the power off or take the cartridge out while it was saving. Why THQ couldn't make this a background thing that you are not even aware of it doing it, while it takes you to something else i'll never know. You just have to sit through it, just like the annoying load times.

Event Selections
The layout of the island looking things is pretty straight forward, you select which of the 4 islands you want to select a race for. Then you get a bunch of dots all over the place to choose from. Seeing as how these are not all there to select until you have unlocked them by earning tokens, they look scattered all over the place. But what was even more annoying, when you finish a race, you get the options to select ""choose another event"", ""Restart Event"" or ""Quit"" to the main menu. When you select ""choose another event"" you are taken back to the island like selection screen, and have to go back into that to see the next event that's opened to you. Why they couldn't just add a ""go to next race"" puzzles me, and why it would not at least take you back to the 1 of 4 event areas of the island you selected if it's going to do this is beyond me.

Track Variations.
I mentioned the four islands thing, in the bottom island that you start from; it's kind of like racing in a beach area. The second area is like a desert, the 3rd is a jungle, and 4th is asphalt streets in a city like atmosphere. There is a few races to every island, some have about 15 to 20 or so... but they are all very much identical. Most of the time you are competing on the same track, but in the ""race"", ""elimination"" & ""barrier"" rules... meaning you are racing the same course over and over again, and the variation of differences between the changed up races aren't always all that different to the last race. I guess this might have been done due to the ""create a track"" option limiting it to 4 styles was the way to go, but I felt seeing the same 4 objects and skies etc... a little too repetitive and something else needed to be added in to make it feel more variant then just a bunch of reworked tracks the same as the first.

Car Layout Selection
It's rather annoying that you have two ways to view the vehicles. One is like looking at a few side on, within 3 screens. Then once you click on a car, it takes you to that cars model and shows the attributes of the vehicle, you can also press L or R to slide through the cars this way too. Whats a bit of a bother is it takes a second or two to load the car in the second view, and this is the only way you can see the cars attributes. Whats also annoying is the cars are not in order of performance. It would be much simpler is say the first set of cars where the slow ones, and as it goes on, the performances increase, but they are not like this, and it's all over the place. It can be rather annoying to try and compare cars, having to click L or R a bunch of times, or pressing B to go back to the side view thing and select it that way, having to go back into that 2nd screen to see the attributes.

Replay Value (once completed the game)
Nill, zip, nadda, none. Once you have unlocked all the vehicles, there is no message or anything indicating you have completed the game. This is what gives me the `bleeps' about so many DS games that are fun to play, but the pay-off in the end really `bleeps' me off that there is nothing at all. A small NES like ""Thanks for playing/Congratulations"" would be something... but nothing at all? Come on... was no one expected to ever complete this game? Because, I did it in 2 days!

Overall
A great racing game for the DS, but it does have its share of annoyances. But the A.I of opponents is enjoyable, you don't get that feeling like you can't win because the computer is cheating, it's fun, not a lot will challenge you greatly,  so it's kind of relaxing, but well worth the purchase if this type of game appeals to you. Just keep in mind, this feels much more like a racing game that could have utilized whatever vehicles it wanted, the Hot Wheels aspect of it is not what you should concentrate on, as it does not really have anything to do with the game much other then what vehicle you select. But as a racing game, it's a lot of fun for a short period of time.

Which is Better? Hot Wheels ""Beat That"" or ""Track Attack?""
For me personally, I still prefer ""Beat That"". If you have not played either titles, and are interested, I suggest playing ""Beat That"", but do try this game after that one. They are two completely different games, but both are highly enjoyable racing games for the Nintendo DS."
474072,3,it's a find the objects game but some of the objects were very hard to identify. i didn't really like playing it.
233825,3,"First off you should know up front this product is a Chinese counterfeit before you buy it like I did. You have to press down really hard to get the Kinect to attach to the TV mount. The mount seems to work as advertised, but it is obviously not made by the real Pelican video game accessories company. This is a cheap Chinese knock-off that claims it is ""licensed for Ki-nect for X-360"" amongst many other spelling errors. The plastic has a horrible smell which makes me wonder how safe it is to even be touching and using. I feel it is very dishonest to sell this product under the Pelican brand name. If that doesn't bother you then it's a cheap alternative that will probably get the job done for you."
131307,3,"As I said, not worth fifty dollars. The detail of the backgound is indeed impressive. The sounds are in tune and don't sound like old age game songs. I like this game because of the characters you get to play such as the mythological creatures. I have never seen a game that had these creatures in it. The closest game that came to this was the LOTR series. The background of this game was amazing. Technology this advanced made the game more life like. The castle, forest, and even the battle were life like. The characters on the other hand need a little tune up. There is only one problem with them and only one character, which is susan. She stands funny. Some people don't usually care about that, but it was enough to catch my eye. Congrats to caspian's uncle, he knows how to fight. I didn't like lucy that much. She only used daggers. Daggers don't do much for my taste like swords and bows and arrows do. There was one part in the game where caspian was talking, but his mouth didn't move. Sometimes when the characters spoke, their mouth isn't in sync with the words. There was another thing, aslan didn't show up! Then there was the worst thing, after the battle ended, the game ended. In the snap of fingers, it ended! I give a five on detailed background, four on the characters, and a zero on aslan's appearance. The worst thing out of all this is that the game itself didn't even last two hours. It was too easy!"
76840,3,"First of all I will say that the game is lots of fun, if you are willing to cope with trial-and-error gameplay. There are tons of gadgets and if some of you are worried about not having goggles then heres the deal. Ironically, after you throw your goggles out the helicopter after hearing Sam's daughter is dead the JBA gives you an identical pair. You will not get the goggles on the JBA HQ missions or in the prison of Africa (where you get strange aviator type sunglasses which you toggle on and off like night vision). The scope in very fun to use and it even has it's own integrated Night vision, heat vision, and EMP (electro magnetic pulse) vision. The sam's visibilty meter is now a green (total darkness), yellow (visible yet undetected), and red (detected) light. There are so many new gadgets but now I will tell you the major downfalls. This game forced me to spend around $900 to buy a new processor, motherboard, and a video card at half price from a friend. Frankly, Ubisoft have formatted this to work with SM 2.0 which will probably cost them lots of money. Also I have heard (but I cannot be considered reliable) has announced they will not release a patch to fix this problem. In any case the game also has some wierd glitches but I won't go into details since they are very unnoteworthy. The only other annoying thing is that, if you want to get the good upgrades, then you have to go totally undetected the whole game. Mainly I rated this 3 stars overall because of the really annoying system requirements. Last thing I would like to say is, if you have a computer that will run this game, buy it since it is probably one of the best Splinter Cell's ever."
332255,3,"sort of a meh for me. these little rubber grips are too soft in my opinion. getting them on takes a fair amount of effort, and once on the pretty readily slip right off again. the plastic is more slippery than the rubber that is already on the PSV nubs so they effectively made my grip worse."
72383,3,"This game isn't over in a few days,
There are not any short cuts either,
This game requires time as well as doing a balancing act if you are a lone gamer,
If you like slow paced games this is right down your alley"
91718,3,"I'll stay away from a novel here. This game offers nothing new in terms of core gameplay. If you played and loved the other games in the series - you are probably only reading this review so you can flame me for not going ""5"" stars.

Rockstar has employed the quantity over quality technique. You will play the same missions you've been playing for a decade. People will curse like they have touretts, the cars are tough to control and the graphics still can be distracting... but...the story is really good. Nico is very likeable and I was compelled to see what happened next all the way through. Had the story not been as strong, this game would have wore out its welcome after the first couple of hours. I'm usually not a sucker for story, but in this case I'll make an exception. The targeting and cover systems are well implemented for the action sequences, but like most of this game, it is a jack of all trades, master of none.

There are a lot of games that do some of things GTA IV does much better, but only pieces. The game is tremendous fun and I can't stress enough how great the characters are, but you've played it before, this version just has the shiniest wrapper."
295485,3,"Thief is a reboot and revival of the classic Thief Trilogy of video games: The Dark Project (1998), The Metal Age (2002) and Deadly Shadows (2004). These games were hugely influential in their introduction of stealth elements to video games, with importance placed not on combat and killing enemies but on the player sneaking past foes and 'ghosting' through levels to complete objectives with the enemy not even being away of their presence. The SF roleplaying game Deus Ex (2000) also followed a similar strategy, though gave players more tools to choose stealth, combat or other options as they wished.

When Eidos Montreal released Deus Ex: Human Revolution in 2011, they received praise for managing the difficult feat of making a game that honoured its predecessor's freeform choices and design whilst also making the title more accessible and approachable to modern gamers. Hopes were high that they could manage a similar balancing act with Thief. It is questionable if they have succeeded.

The newest incarnation of Thief is superficially similar to its forebears. You have a large hub area in the City where you can buy supplies, carry out opportunistic robberies or undertake minor side-quests for different employers. There is also a storyline that you can dip into and out of at will. Garrett is not very good at combat (although he does receive upgrades as the game progresses and can hold his own more effectively later on), so stealth is the order of the day. Hiding in shadows, moving quietly and making use of both the environment and tools such as rope arrows are all essential to avoid tedious fights which will usually end with Garrett's death. The game puts a large amount of importance on light, with enemies only being able to spot you motionless in well-lit areas. Water arrows can be used to extinguish torches and Garrett has a special 'swooping' move which can be used to move rapidly through lit areas whilst only briefly confusing guards, rather than fully alerting them to your presence.

All of this is theoretically good stuff, and the game is at its best in tense moments where you have infiltrated the heart of a dangerous location and one wrong move can spell disaster. However, it also feels stage-managed. Unlike the previous titles, you can only use rope arrows on specific beams of wood, which makes no sense. The game also discourages you from using certain lit routes by making the light sources indestructible gas lamps (which inexplicably can't be smashed by any of the tools at your disposal, including explosives) or oil lamps instead of torches. Exactly how oil lamps in the City work when they have no external controls of any kind is something the game leaves a mystery. The game then goes a step further into hand-holding by allowing you to jump and climb walls in certain contextual circumstances, usually by sign-painting climbable walls in white paint or sticking very large and obvious grills on them. Thief seems to delight in giving you an array of options and toys to play with and then arbitrarily places restrictions on how and when you can use them.

There's still usually a variety of different ways of accomplishing each task, but these boil down into two or three approaches per mission that everyone will experience. The original Thief trilogy was more of a simulation, which let you run riot with the tools and abilities in the game in large, sandbox-like levels, with dozens of viable approaches for each situation at hand. The new Thief never comes close to replicating that experience. Sequels should expand and improve upon their forebears, so for this game to be more limited than what came before is disappointing.

Even worse for Thief was the release of Dishonored in late 2012. A homage and love letter to the Thief series (amongst others), Dishonored featured a mix of stealth, combat and magic in a weirdpunk world that felt more like the original Thief games than the official reboot does. Dishonored did place more emphasis on magic and combat, but it was also extremely atmospheric with a well-designed world, a reasonably well-written (if not particularly original) storyline and a well-defined supporting cast of characters. Thief, on the other hand, features a wafer-thin backdrop, a badly-written and corny storyline and a largely forgettable cast of cliches. If you haven't played or are not interested in playing Dishonored, such a comparison may be meaningless, but between the two games Thief stands as the weaker.

None of this is to say that Thief is a terrible game. As the first title in a new franchise it would have gotten a much more favourable reception, and there is much to enjoy about it. The game is decently long: doing all the side-quests will take it well over 20 hours, and successfully 'ghosting' some of the trickier missions gives a real sense of achievement. There are a couple of missions, most notably the excursion to the lunatic asylum, which are chillingly atmospheric and well-designed. And, as superficial as they are, the game systems are intermittently effective at creating the illusion of being a master thief. It never really lasts very long, however, and in the endgame Thief loses whatever grasp it had on being a stealth title and turns into a linear action adventure with you dodging explosions, defeating your enemies in a series of boss fights and completing the game in the exact one way the designers want you to, to get a tediously predictable cliffhanger ending. I should probably also mention the mutant enemies who have super senses and can't be disabled with a takedown, which are a woeful game design decision.

Thief (***) is an enjoyable stealth game that fails to live up to the titles that came before it and is distinctly less accomplished than the similar Dishonored but, when taken on its own merits, is entertaining enough to merit a play-through. But the title falls way short of its potential."
352626,3,"In a nutshell, the thumbsticks are extremely sensitive and you will have to adjust your X and Y settings in games that provide that option.  The face buttons, however, are very insensitive and require a harder press to register.
The D-pad is less than impressive...but at least half the fault lies in the Microsoft design for the D-Pad
The cord is 8 - 10"" shorter than most corded controllers which has required moving my chair that much closer to the TV.

So it was always night time in my town and i couldn't do any of the daytime activities without playing with the 3ds internal clock (which is considered cheating BTW)."
323711,3,"This game is a solid 3 stars. The reasoning being besides the obvious comments about the missing toddlers and the pool missing in the beginning, but which they gave back, I miss the free world playing where you can simply visit the neighborhood without a loading screen. I'll give Sims 4 the realistic aspects of the Sims resembling the person playing or however you want it, plus the cool features of unlocking stuff and aspirations/traits. The Sims 4 reminds me of a more advanced version of the Sims 2. Although Sims 3 is much better hands down on certain features that are lacking in Sims 4, I wish not only they added the careers back in which you can actually see your Sim actually going to work, but I wish they kept removing the loading screen just like Sims 3, how it was so easy to view anything."

445961,3,"Tomb Raider 3 was by far the most difficult Tomb Raider I have ever played. I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me?
The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at.
Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire ""Story So far..."" feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels.
Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!!
Yippee.
Antarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck!
But in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3.
If you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize "" Draw a flare, take one step forward, one step back, turn around three times, then jump forward"" if you want to beat this game!"
226399,3,"Then why 3 stars?, this new bread of adventure theme games I love it now, and off course Uncharted wins the prize and that's the number one reason why Tomb Raider lost the first star because doesn't beat uncharted or be at the same graphic level, The animation, the landscapes ""the camera point of view"", the textures and sound FX could be better, If Uncharted did a really good job why not Tomb Raider?. The second star is for a bunch of reason, the game-flow is slow and sometimes boring, I think the idea to get points and spend it to ""earn"" something is better in a RPG games than a adventurer game if the idea is tray to show a progress and grow up from the character itself, OK that progress can be imply over the story continue not stop it and think ""Ok I want spend this on mmm...mmm... ok more bullets... ok now, o yes Lara is trying to find that thing....mmm so..."", That kind of things is good only in Rpg games, in adventurer games I want jump, fall, climb, shoot, discover the secret without pause the mood and obviously fight, what happen with the melee action?, Lara doesn't Fight actually she needs run or dodge if a bad guy are to close, I want punch or kick he not run.
In another hand the music is amazing I will buy the soundtrack, the actress for Lara Croft made a superior work (you can see her in extras file), the story is not amazing but is interesting and you can enjoy it, It's a really good game but no amazing."

Now the case didn't get in the way of the screen or anything but the way it looked just bothered me. The more I looked at it, the worse it got to the point where I ended up buying a hard plastic case to replace it. I'm unsure if maybe I stretched the case too much putting it on or if all of these cases are just that loose around the screen area. It also might just be personal preference but I just couldn't deal with how it looked around the screen."

2015,3,"Croc is one of those games I only had a small chance encounter with when I was younger. The demo disc that came with my PlayStation back in 1997 had a demo of the game and by all accounts I was pretty taken with. The graphics were bright and colorful, the world it presented (and by extension Croc and the Gobbos) were cute and likable and overall it seemed to be a pretty solid 3D platformer. Developed by Argonaut Software who developed the Super FX technology used in Nintendo's Star Fox on the SNES in the early 1990's, I ordered a copy of the game based on those memories... but fifteen years is a long time to be away from any game and with advancements in gaming this leaves little room for error. Unfortunately, if the title of this review is any indication, Croc pretty much squanders most of the good will its positives bring to the table and only serves as a history lesson as to why the series never saw daylight after the 32-bit generation.

Almost all of Croc's problems center on the controls. Well, it's not completely on the controls, rather it's a combination of the controls AND a camera that does whatever it wants - but if it wasn't for this I firmly believe more people would remember it. The game's controls are not unlike those in Core Design/Edios' Tomb Raider series - which in today's world some people find rather archaic - but I'm still at home with them since I grew up with that game. What makes Croc different (and ultimately more problematic) is the camera is not completely locked behind Croc at every moment. This makes certain moments of the game painful to play and its because these controls are more befitting of a game like Tomb Raider where the game world is more technical being built on a grid of squares. This isn't the case with Croc.

Well, that's kind of a lie because the further you get in the Legend of Gobbos the more technical (and challenging) the levels are with all their little platforms and obstacles where the clunky controls become a real liability. Even worse are the controls when Croc is underwater or doing a mini-game as these sections are simply horrendous. The situation with the controls is a real shame since the game (aside from the utterly pathetic boss battles) would still be astounding today if it wasn't for them. It's (kind) of possible to enjoy Croc despite its problems but I personally had to play the game in small bite-sized portions to really avoid my building frustrations - a red flag for a gamer if there ever was one.

Despite Croc's shortcomings I can't really tell people to flat-out avoid the game. I still have a soft spot for it (and the characters) despite what I experienced while playing through it. Still, if you can I'd recommend trying - or revisting - the game before you buy it. For those that played Croc when it originally came out nostalgia might be enough to save it, but those without an attachment to the IP will quickly see the game as the ailing entity it is."

13370,3,"I've always like this game. It tends to be one of those I choose to play whenever I want a game to just relax with. I tends to create my own maps and that makes it more enjoyable. One thing. The game will, on occasions, playing user designed maps, just lock up. This shows up as an ""illegal operation"" and you can usually hit ESC and then tell Windows to close the game. I tend to play this game under Win98se as it runs better under that OS. It will runs under XP, but not very well and the lockups seem more numerous there. This doesn't totally keep the game from running, just really creates a problem running the self created maps. The campaign game seems to run fine without the lock-ups."

74264,3,"I've played Perfect Dark on the N64 back and the game was hated for a stupid reason, an ALIEN CHARACTER. It's a stupid reason because the game was fun, it had an okay story and the graphics surpassed the 1997 'Goldeneye'. Perfect Dark Zero, the game looks beautiful, they made Joanna Dark sexier than the N64 incarnation, the graphics had more oomph which demonstrated how powerfull the X-Box 360 is and it brought me back to the early 2000's. Why did it fail? Here's why, Hit detection was annoying, Aimming was below simple and the story was just too danm confusing to follow. It's okay for a rental, it's not too terrible to where it's unplayable. To get your money's worth, buy the special edition version which includes a novel, the soundtrack and a short comic book along with the game itself.
The game is okay, nothing speecial but it's far below the expectations of the first game."

I realized that this week was the first time I've touched it in months. The graphics suck and the customizable characters are little wierd looking. The only game I semi like is volleyball and disc golf and sometimes cricket. The bocce, football and soccer were just .... you fill in the blank.  I'm a sports fan, for a sports game, it just does not compare to Wii Sports. It may be cheap but I would not waste my money. Maybe a small child may find these games interesting and won't care about the graphics.  I think I will just go out and get Wii Sports Resort. At least it looks more interesting. I tried it out a Best Buy and it seems a little more on par (the graphics were great) and I liked the play control. I should have listened to the previous reviewers on this one."
346086,3,"The system itself is pretty cool. Nothing Really revolutionary...kinect, voice commands, etc. The game sthat are available now are somewhat limited but I'm excited to see what happens when they really push the limits of the system in the coming years. The console is about the size of the original x box along with a brick sized power supply. There are quite a few cords and this makes for some hasssle when attempting to set up. The voice commands don't always work and you feel the need to yell to use them. The facial recognition is spot on. The reason I'm giving the system 3 stars is because I had a disc drive malfunctiuon, Luckily I was able to take it back to the store and exchange it. There is absolutely no reason for this to happen. You'd figure they would have learned their lessons with the ""red ring of death"" on the 360. These malfunctions can be prevented by spending a tiny bit more per console during construction, This laziness almost make me go buy the PS4. If anything happens with my replacement system, the only reason I will use microsoft is for windows gaming on my PC. Titan fall is a blast. The game is fast paced and to my liking, most everyone on there is silent lol. The titans handle well and make you feel big and powerful. The pace is breakneck and right off the bat youll be able to really beat up on some people."
324074,3,In my opinion the ridges are in the  wrong place. They are where your hand doesn't touch. The ridges should be on the sides of the controller and where your pinky finger and the next finger grip the controller on the bottom.
478782,3,"This game does a lot of things for the good, unfortunately a lot snags it down.  The biggest draw to the Lunar franchise it's it's amazing Music(it's part of the story!), the downside is every time you change zones in the game it pauses or sometimes even restarts the music!

The main story is there with some redone visuals and remastered soundtrack.  Combat system is also there with some tweaks as well.  It's still an overall good game, but it is nowhere near as good as the PSone game."

475043,3,"I enjoyed the story and I reminded me very much of other adventure games, like Tunguska, Interpol, and the like You play as 2 characters alternating between the two while following the story-line.  There are many cut-scenes and some ""timed"" responses needed that affect the gameplay.  Supposedly there are 8? possible slightly different endings depending on how you answer the dialog questions and what actions each character takes - (each character can be affected independently apprently). I only played it through once so far, so I have only experienced the one ending. But it was a pretty good one though.  Graphics - on par with other adventure games - voice acting - not bad in my opinion. I enjoyed the story and the cut-scenes although i can see where some might say there were too many. also the game was broken up into 18 acts? This may have been overkill as some of the ""chapters"" are very short. to me this was a solid 3.5 (out of 5)"
49573,3,"I looked forward to this game and wanted desperately to be able to give it a good review, partly just to reward the publishers for having the guts to publish a story-based game (as opposed to yet another first-person shooter featuring mute Neanderthals with guns). But as other reviewers have said, the interface is so clumsy it short-circuits the game completely. I'm not good at the hand-eye stuff, and this game has some sequences that require lightning reflexes -- coupled with an interface so unbelievably awkward and anti-intuitive that it's almost another bad guy trying to make you fail. And it's all the more frustrating because the story, the characters, the acting, the writing are all so good that I really want to go on with the game, to find out what happens. How could they do the story so well and the interface so badly?

Well, I hear Benoit Sokal (of Syberia fame) is working on another game. Guess we'll just have to wait for that."

13341,3,"First of all, PS2 is not the most powerful gamesystem on the planet.  4MB  of VRam is holding this system back.  The X-Box demolishs the PS2 in terms  of pure speed.  The X-Box will have DVD, Ethernet, Hard Drive, and four  controller ports built in not two like Sony.  The only reason Sony wins in  the long run is not games but because zombies believe their marketing and  buy Sony.  Don;t believe the hype.  Metal Gear Solid X is coming out for  X-Box so don't brag PS2 owners.  There is one game that looks great and  that is The BOuncer, I have to admit that game looks fantastic, but that is  Square, not Sony.  Wait for the X-Box and save your money and time for  another system.  If you want to wait for 3 months to get your system and  pay 400-500 dollars just to get your system and a couple of games, be my  guest, it's just money down the drain."
386324,3,"I've seen this game get a lot of hate, but it's really not that bad.  Unfortunately, when you have to start with ""it's not that bad"", you also have to concede that it is also ""not that good"".  For every good idea there is an equally bad one, it's a very middle of the road game.

Visuals 6/10:  The character models for the monsters are great.  They look just like I remember seeing in the classic Godzilla movies (by the way, once you unlock them all, you can play just about any iteration of Godzilla you want, from the original 1954 Godzilla to the more recent American 2014 Godzilla).  However, the environments are incredibly bland.  The attacks and movements are very well detailed and rendered, but the destructible environments look very low-res and copy-paste when they fall apart.

Sound 5/10:  The Godzilla theme has been one of my favorite pieces of movie music since I was a child, and I am happy to report that it is very present in this game and it is a great as it has ever been.  Unfortunately, all of the other music is very forgettable.  The monster roars are exactly what they should be (you can even hit a button to make Godzilla do his classic roar) and some of the funky attack sounds (like Ghidorah's lightning) are perfectly pulled from those old movies . . . but the rest of the sound design is very weak, full of repetitive, stock sound effects that just don't have the 'oomph' that should accompany a game about giant monsters blasting each other through cities.

Controls 5/10:  The gameplay definitely takes some getting used to.  You know how roughly 98% of games these days use the left stick on the controller to move forward/back and side to side, while the right stick is used to turn left/right and look up/down?  In this game the left stick is the same, but the right stick only controls the camera.  If you want to turn, you need to use the shoulder buttons.  The goal, apparently, is to have the player treat the right stick as the camera of the military team watching Godzilla's rampage.  At certain points, if you have the camera aimed well, you can hit a button to 'record' Godzilla research which helps you level up.  It's a very weird mechanic that is not fun enough to sacrifice smoother controls for.  Though, it's possible that the weird turning wouldn't be such a big deal if the game moved just a bit faster.  You mover terribly slowly in this game.  It's not so bad in small doses, you really get the feel of a huge, lumbering behemoth stomping and battling while tiny cars/tanks/trees/and such are crunched underfoot, but when you have to cross the map to get to an objective you may as well wrap a rubber band around the controller and go make a sandwich, cus it's gonna be a while.

Story 5/10:  Well, to be fair, the human stories were always the weakest part of any Godzilla movie.  The game is no different.  The 'story' is from the perspective of the government and military as they try to figure out the best way to deal with Godzilla (you) rampaging across the country.  Thankfully these segments are minimal.  At the beginning they serve to provide the controls and there is some humor to be found in the dialogue of the  government officials as they try to brush off the importance of dealing with the situation (I seem to recall one character claiming that Godzilla would stop soon as he would recognize humans as fellow citizens of earth and show compassion, pretty funny actually), however, the continuous messages manage to get very old very fast.

Overall I'd have to give it a 5 or 6 out of 10.  If you are not a Godzilla fan, I doubt you'd find more than an hour or so of enjoyment from it (just look up the Game Grumps playthrough of it on YouTube and save yourself a few bucks).  If you are a Godzilla fan and don't mind your nostalgia with some blandness on top, then it might be your cup o tea.  Honestly, it's a lot like an absolutely delicious burger served on a really bland, dry roll.  If you don't mind the tough, cardboardy bread, you'll find a pretty tasty burger there."

29261,3,"The Nintendo GameCube Memory Card 59. It is definitely a good memory card, don't get me wrong, but this card could definitely be improved. It is fairly small, and fits into the memory card slot A or B in your Nintendo GameCube. You could easily take this card over to a friend's house to play with your saved game; it fits in anyone's pocket very well.
The only major problem with this memory card is that it lacks a lot of major space. A typical game save can be between three to ten blocks, but some take many more, especially if you want to do a season on a sports game. One game, All-Star Baseball 2003, takes over two hundred blocks to save a season. This is ridiculous! There is one third-party brand memory card that offers over one thousand blocks of memory space, and it is only double the price of the ordinary GameCube memory card!
One thing about this memory card, however, is that it never fails. Never have I had any trouble with any of my memory cards. They have never cause any trouble freezing a game, or messing up my GameCube in any way.
The dilemma of the memory card space will soon be solved with a first-party memory card coming soon with two hundred and fifty one (251) blocks of space! The GameCube Memory Card 251 will be much easier to save your games on.
Overall, this memory card is good, but not great. It needs improvement, which it will get at some point in the next few months.

70945,3,"When i first played this game i found it to be a very impressive showcase for what my X-box 360 is capable of. Well i was half right, you see the game does look good, the graphics ain't the problem it's the horrible bugs and awful framerate that are the biggest problems with this squad based shooter. I had to restart the game three times during one session because of bugs, i mean it's just not on. Another problem is the AI of your squad, you give them an order (The few orders there is) and they just start running around like headless chickens. The enemy AI is also bad, they start firing at you before they even see you and there appears to be no jump which can be exteamly annoying. It's not all bad it can be a very engaging experience but you have to be prepared to put up with some very annoying bugs and glitches. If your a fan of the Ghost Recon games then you'll more than likely look past the bug's and just get on with it but if your new to the series then i suggest you buy Call Of Duty 2 or wait for Splinter Cell: Double Agent instead."
26348,3,"this games is the most FUN of any of the games I've played on PS2. My wife and I just load it up and start shooting everything.

I didn't give it 5 stars because it's WAY to short. You'll go through all the levels the first night you have it. But it's fun, you'll go through the levels again and again."
196644,3,"Super Mario Galaxy 2 is, unfortunately, unforgivably bland. Simply put- it does not live up to the hype. It does not make the original SMG pointless in comparison (which is the ridiculous suggestion I've been reading on message boards by posters who are apparently still wrapped up in the hype machine to see things how they *really* are). The game basically copies every single aspect that made the original so great without adding much of anything innovative. Many of the enemies and obstacles are exactly the same, but placed in different environments and situations as a way to assure that any comparisons be kept to a minimum. The only problem there is that I can see through the disguise and take the game for what it really is: a decent continuation -but ultimately a shameless copycat- of a fantastic and highly original platformer in Super Mario Galaxy. This means not only does SMG2 hardly stand apart but it barely even warrants a purchase. This may be the first time in the Mario series I can recall where the follow-up (sequel) is almost exactly the same. Oh wait, there is one other example- the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (NES game). It's almost exactly the same as the first one, but most people either haven't played or simply don't care about the Japanese version of that old, overbearingly challenging game.

It should be mentioned right away that the boss fights are much worse this time around. The strategies with bosses such as Bouldergeist and Bowser from Super Mario Galaxy encouraged me to sort through a fairly elaborate set of patterns concerning several different attacks until I finally figured out what it is I'm supposed to do. I mean while playing Super Mario Galaxy, I was standing there in my living room eagerly and excitedly trying to figure out their weak points all the while totally amazed that Nintendo actually went the extra mile in making them so varied. These are two VERY creative bosses that I happen to believe smear everything that SMG2 has to offer, that's for sure. What made them so extraordinary is that I was completely dumbfounded at the complexity of their attacks. ""This is coming from a Mario game???"" I'd frequently say to myself (since I grew up in the early 90's with Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World when boss fights were made extremely simplistic by only having to dodge a few moves and stomping on their head 3 times- the polar opposite of THESE fights). Everytime I made a mistake with Bouldergeist or Bowser (which was plenty of times I'm embarrassed to admit) it was the result of me being careless, not the game being cheap. Bowser in particular completely blows me away. His pattern consists of dodging SEVERAL fireballs, dodging his spiked-ball form, spin attacking his exposed weak point while he's rolling around in a temporary boulder formation, and carefully jumping over his many (up to 5 sometimes) layers of rings. If you mess up once and take a hit, Bowser seems to backtrack to his previous pattern and you have to successfully dodge these moves all over again. A far cry from say, luring him overtop a few layers of bricks so he can fall through the floor, or running underneath King Koopa on a bridge and reaching the end. Let's be honest, Bowser was bland in the early days with only fireballs and hammers doing any kind of damage. Yeah, this SMG fight is what I call extremely elaborate in comparison.

Which brings us to Bowser's SMG2 battle. Well at least Nintendo had the good intention of making the boss fights strategic and enjoyable, but... it feels watered down and ""Been there, done that"" now. Bowser in particular is basically the same fight with only one or two new flashy moves (including launching high in the air and soaring down like a meteorite pounding the planet which is admittedly cool and encourages the player to ground pound these floating golden balls that temporarily hang in the air and smack Bowser's body) and it's impossible for me to believe anyone in their right mind would suggest this is in any way shape or form superior to his original incarnation from Galaxy 1 where the true innovation of boss fights and level design was in full swing. There's a gigantic floating snake boss that seems intimidating at first, but since he floats around the planet with a simple to take down strategy (all you really have to do is spin attack the rings on his body up to 6 times after hearing a familiar ""choo choo"" train sound effect as he shoots through the ground) he's not much of a threat and certainly not an appealing example of creativity. The fire snake fight is pretty hard, admittedly. Same battle, but he's on fire this time. I suppose the boss in Flipsville Galaxy is sort of unique- you have to walk under the floor (or over, depending on the situation) so you're standing directly underneath of the boss and ground pound his stomach. The bosses in Freezy Flake and Boulder Bowl Galaxy are WAY too easy and unnecessary inclusions.

The darn piranha plant boss that screams like a baby comes back for another helping (you know, the first boss you fight in SMG) and this time he has no tail- you just repeatedly and mindlessly spin attack the cracked egg around his backside until it breaks and he dies. Why Nintendo felt the need to dumb down an already pathetically easy boss is beyond me. Just bringing it back is an even bigger question mark. A couple other bosses (and levels) come back for another round as well (such as an even easier to defeat Bugaboom, and that one thwomp area from Beach Bowl Galaxy but sped up considerably faster this time) and these are all totally pointless returns since we've already completed them in the previous game. Lazy programming decisions. I must say however, that the Megahammer is a really cool boss fight. You have to frantically run around platforms using Yoshi's tongue to gather torpedoes, and then launch them back at the glass sections of the Megahammer itself while dodging torpedoes and rings. Running around makes the battle quite the exercise too. Unquestionably a high point in the game. Bowser Jr's Boom Bunker is pretty cool as well, even though it's clearly just a gigantic screen-sized version of the Undergrunt Gunner from the first games Toy Time Galaxy with the same fireball-homing attacks and glass protection above his head. It only stands apart because you need a cloud flower this time given his enormous size.

The music is a LOT worse too. Make that inconsistent- for every awesome theme we have to persevere a bad one. In the first Galaxy you had dreamy and effectively atmospheric outer space music of the Space Junk Galaxy, subtle touches of jazz in the grassy lands of the Honeyhive Galaxy (that's been remixed with unnecessary flutes here, though granted the flutes DO give it a peppy 70's feel similar to the Brady Bunch), the detective-like mysterious theme of the Bubble Breeze levels, and cool early 80's-resembling synths (particularly sounding like the rock band Genesis) in a couple of the water stages (such as Buoy Base). Actually the Buoy Base music plays in a stage here that strongly resembles the design of the Buoy Base itself, but dumbed down considerably with switch-hitting slow motion effects and less rotating platforms making for an easier climb in comparison. I do really admire a particular subtle touch when the music sounds like it's being played through headphones. This occurs briefly whenever you hit a switch. Not a fan of the cliched Middle Eastern music found in Clockwork Ruins Galaxy either.

The music in this game just does not live up to the same incredible standard. There's a distinct style of jazz being played in several of the stages such as Yoshi's Star, Boulder Bowl and Throwback Galaxy. For my personal tastes, jazz music is completely inappropriate and distracting for video game music, especially in a challenging adventure game when concentration is mandatory for completion. Not the proper setting at all. At least the beach music this time is somewhat listenable. However let's give credit where it's due- one of the water themes is REALLY awesome (from Cosmic Cove). Dare I even say the best water theme ever? Probably influenced by the theme from the first Donkey Kong Country's water stage, it's amazingly effective in both mood and melody. Oh and Bulb Berry's Mysterious Glow (or rather Sweet Mystery Galaxy) contains another excellent theme that captures the feeling of dreaminess. I really DESPISE the theme from Throwback Galaxy. Perhaps you'd have to either be a huge fan of Super Mario 64 or simply have strong childhood memories of the Nintendo 64 days in order to appreciate this theme, who knows. Then again I can name an equally crappy song from Yoshi's Island and no special memories in the WORLD can make *that* piece of music any more enjoyable. The other water theme from Slimy Spring Galaxy sounds like some partial Radiohead-influenced ambient piece that doesn't work for me. I admit I absolutely LOVE the Upside Dizzy Galaxy theme. The main melody is based around one or two techno notes with a colorful dash of other rich and rewarding arrangements in the background. A well-performed song, as is the familiar underground Super Mario Bros. theme turned really eerie and haunting in the Flip-Out Galaxy.

Only a few levels are superior to the ones from the first Galaxy in the fun department. It should be said that the ghost galaxy in this game (called Haunty Halls) is better than the ghost sections of the previous Galaxy only because these ones actually feel like *levels* where you have to avoid disappearing/chasing boos along with the obstacle of having to jump across several tricky designed platforms that come out of the dreaded dark matter. You better polish your shoes if you want to quickly make it across these moving platforms! Lots of dangerous and exciting situations this time around that really plays on the ghost theme- unquestionably influenced by Super Mario World's ghost houses. It actually FEELS like I'm going through a haunted house in SMG2. This was sorely needed in the original SMG's ghostly stages. The one section where you're surrounded by dark matter and urgently need to run through moving platforms is atmospherically creepy and it's quite intense making your way through. The ghostly portions in SMG are mainly occupied with ghost races which are really cool, don't get me wrong, but not as entertaining as the actual ghost stages featured here. I could probably do without the obvious Super Mario World moving platform imitation, however. I think the planet with these type of platforms is called Boo Moon Galaxy. Riding on them wasn't particularly fun in Super Mario World (because I remember how many times I'd miss and fall into the lava, ugh) and it's not any better here. I guess seeing the same set-up upgraded to a 3D environment is sort of cool, though.

Several levels are flat out boring. The honey (bee) levels are back and the one called Honeyhop Galaxy is shorter and somewhat sloppy and rushed in its design with less emphasis on exploration. Honeybloom Galaxy is worse since it's based around a really easy 2D level design with hardly any dangers whatsoever. A level for babies or newbies. At first my impression of this stage is that it works magnificently as a fast-paced chase to the finish involving swinging over vines and avoiding pockets of water while in the bee form. Now however, I realize it severely lacks challenge. I feel the same way about the 2D swimming portions from the Cosmic Cove stage. Beautiful, but easy easy easy. The lava levels have segments that are really intense and nerve racking such as the one with the mad dash upwards across several fast-moving platforms while trying to hold onto a cloud flower, and the exceptionally frightening stage where a neverending parade of those lava monsters (that first appeared in Super Mario World) march down the screen and munch at the platforms, requiring the player to be really careful moving across- can you say pink elephants! However these levels ultimately fail to live up to the consistency and plentiful variety that the original presented with the Melty Molten stages and feel more like rehashes, and my goodness, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to overload this game with so many darn gigantic CHOMP HEADS and OCTOOMBAS? They were implemented just enough in the first Galaxy to get your fill, but here? It's overkill, seriously. Chomps are rolling all OVER the darn place and octoobmas are located in every single place where they can get in a cheap hit (now occasionally shooting TWO rocks at a time, ugh!) The entire galaxy devoted to the numerous chomps is a nightmare too, especially the one where you have to spring bounce (or backflip) over an endless amount of chomps rolling across the floor. The level that is puzzle-like with the gold rolling chomps unfortunately isn't backed up by being any fun on numerous playthroughs. It's more like ""Oh that was clever"" when you figure out you're supposed to roll the chomps across platforms a certain way while *standing* and pushing down on the blue buttons, but definitely annoying to repeat this level again. Oh and you'll sometimes see MINI chomps as well (or kid chomps as I like to call them).

The water stages are worse in SMG2. I admire the way the Cosmic Cove Galaxy alternates between 3D and 2D camera angles and swimming movements, and creatively uses a freezing technique near the beginning that makes the water and the scenery very beautiful. The part near the end where you're swimming through water cubes is unbelievably cool and a rare example of amazing design creativity. Still, none of this is the least bit challenging. I could definitely do without yet another bunny grabbing mini game though. I've had my fill of those from the first game. This rabbit mission is way more dangerous than all the ones from the first game combined due to the many holes that serve as endless pits, and the fast-moving ice skating skills needed to catch up to the bunny. However the first SMG game has so many unique and better utilized racing levels in the water with penguins, cosmic Luigi, whales, and an enormous bony fish boss fight with torpedoes that it comes as no surprise that the water stages in the sequel simply can't compete.

There's a snow level here. It's not as enticing as SMG's Freezeframe Galaxy and it doesn't really do anything noteworthy that stands apart from the snow levels in several other 3D games, but I do admire the beautiful snowy environments. It's really short and generic with giants snowballs and snowgoombas everywhere. I admire the brief blizzard segment for the way it makes you feel secluded and lost somewhere in Russia. The sand levels -at least as far as collecting green stars- are MUCH harder this time around with more emphasis on overflowing rivers of sand and several rows of fast-moving fireballs. It's extremely easy to lose a life by making a bad jumping (or sliding) decision. Literally sliding off the entire river and directly into the bottom of the screen is a strong possibility. The sand often flows backwards, making the trip across even longer. I like a certain platform ride near the end of one mission, however. It involves magikoopas and yes, chomp heads. Magikoopa uses his magic wand and the chomp head uses his rolling ability to destroy portions of the moving platform that Mario is riding on, making navigation to the gold star tricky and fun. Bowser's final castle is rather disappointing since it's relatively bland in comparison to the fast-moving, obstacle driven intensity found in the first Mario game. The navigation through this one is slower, and the obstacles are less creative and threatening. It's inconsistent too. The part with the drill/pockets of sand/dodging giant bullet bills is boring with no replay value, and the segment with Yoshi near the end is downright tedious since controlling Yoshi whenever he grabs a dash pepper makes for plenty of jerky, awkward movements and plenty of deaths as a result of a rapidly closing wall made of fire that you'll discover. We've already seen rotating fireball rods mixed in with tricky camera angles for dramatic effect in the first game so nothing new in that regard here.

Oh and the most insulting level imaginable is definitely the Throwback Galaxy. I don't mind the updated and prettier graphics of the Super Mario 64 levels (even though Nintendo is repeating what's already been done which just SCREAMS a lack of creativity) but what I DO certainly mind is the stage where you have to fight 5 bosses in a row from the first Galaxy. It's not only pointless to make us repeat the same bosses and strategies of the previous game, but it's also flat out boring and irritating since these bosses are the weak, easy versions and not the daredevil or speedy comet versions so there's no real urgency to try your hardest or even feel satisfied after you've conquered them. What a terrible idea to repeat what's already been implemented previously and a COMPLETE waste of time. Still, this is at least better than the levels that focus on red and blue platforms that open and close whenever Mario spins. Absolutely boring and a chore to go through these particular stages (the chore being, when you're not sure you'll make it across a long gap so you instinctively spin Mario at the end of a long jump and yet, spinning in this stage could result in a quicker death than you originally planned).

The Supermassive Galaxy is obviously trying to recapture some of the magic that World 4 of Super Mario Bros. 3 used by scattering the levels with overgrown, super-sized enemies, however it's underutilized and way too short here. We've already seen giant goombas in the first Super Mario Galaxy, and giant green koopas and piranha plants were first presented to us, again, back in SMB3. This idea is nothing new or innovative. Oh and another major disappointment- another terribly bland beach level that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. Sorry Nintendo, but beach levels haven't been interesting in Mario games since Yoshi's Island. It's been THAT long! At least this one has Yoshi and spiny-throwing lakitus. The lack of interest is because these particular type of beach stages play on the ""beaches are relaxing"" theme (or in the case of a video game, ""beaches are less threatening"") which means these portions of the game are really empty with only a few enemies and dangerous platforms in sight, and honestly there's barely a reason why these particular stages should even exist other than tossing in a bit of variety. I mean if I wanted to take a breather I'd just put the game down for a few minutes. Beaches don't fit Mario games in my opinion. Oh and whether you're going through the stage normally or with the drill, it doesn't change the fact that Flipsville Galaxy is downright *boring*. I truly despise this stage. Drilling and/or flipping upside down over and over again just to progress forward... VERY tedious. The drill may be a cool item, but this is proof that basing an entire stage around it was a disastrous idea. The purple coin mission in this stage was initially horrendous due to the limited movements of using the drill, but better now that I found a reliable formula.

I don't really like the cloud levels either (Fluffy Bluff and Cloudy Court Galaxy respectively) for a couple reasons. Again, the design of these stages is sickening and unbearably cutesy in a Super Mario Sunshine kind of way (the resemblance is immediately noticeable) and the cloud flower is overused in both stages (I'll share my feelings with this item below). Both stages share the same unbearably overdone orchestration. The Puzzle Plank Galaxy is fun the first time around, but never again. Catchy hoedown theme song at least. The Space Storm Galaxy was great until all potential was lost the moment I had to guide one of those darn red spinning topmen around several open holes and do this while avoiding these VERY annoying, tiny ricocheting type enemies that insist on pushing Mario over the side and to his death. The topmen were more tolerable in the first SMG game. The Battle Belt Galaxy feels more like a practice or beginners course stage for those unfamiliar with the game mechanics and the way Mario travels (star blasts) from one miniature planet to another fighting enemies that are basically generic and overused by this point. Even worse- this stage appears in World 6 near the end of the game! The worst spot to put a level like this. This stage is unnecessary in my opinion and feels incomplete. The Flash Black Galaxy is a total ripoff of an old Donkey Kong Country level where the lights frequently flicker on and off. Same idea here, but at least in the case of the SMG2 level it's saved by unique floating movements by Yoshi. However I found out that sticking to the left the whole time guarantees an easy trip to the launch star- turn right when you reach the top ceiling. Oh well. Some of Bowser's stages are boring. I already mentioned Bowser's Galaxy Generator (the last one) but Bowser's Fiery Flotilla is dreadfully dull and short (as is Bowser Jr's Boom Bunker which isn't even a stage really).

Much to the displeasure of thousands (if not millions) the rolling starball levels are back and more complex than ever! Oh and get this- while riding and maneuvering the ball you actually have to push chomp heads off platforms. No kidding. You can probably sit there and imagine how difficult this is, however nothing and I mean NOTHING is harder than the purple coin mission where you're rolling down a steep rainbow-colored hill at lightning speed and forced to collect (if memory serves) 100 out of 110 coins. This means you can only miss 10 coins while riding that horrendous starball and trust me, it's VERY difficult. You better believe you're in for a rude awakening with this stage, haha. I wish the bubbles and stingray race levels from the first Galaxy made a return. They were awesome, however in Galaxy 2 you get gliding levels with tedious and jerky movements. The backgrounds may be beautiful (especially the dark green trees and peaceful flowing rivers in Wild Glide Galaxy) but the frustratingly SUPER slow control movements of the actual gliding makes it hard for me to enjoy these stages. I REALLY wish you could pick up speed by simply holding down the A button. Instead, speed increase occurs by pointing the Wii remote down but... depending on the mission, sometimes this isn't reliable enough to gain enough speed. If you remember stingray racing was fairly simple since the object was to just make it to the goal in under 3 minutes. I wonder if the generous 3-minute expectation is because Nintendo thought people would struggle to just keep the stingray on the slippery and narrow water track? We'll never know the reason for such a generosity. Anyway, back to the rolling starball level with the chomp head. Get this- you actually have to re-do this stage if you want the extra star, and this time you're TIMED! As if maneuvering the starball wherever you want it to go isn't difficult enough. It's a nightmare, trust me! Still, the requirement in memorizing the ramps in Rolling Coaster Galaxy is necessary in order to collect 100 purple coins which easily makes it the second hardest level in the game.

Yoshi is a decent addition but he's not as frequently available as you'd probably expect given all the hype he's received from the numerous online reviews you've probably read. He's in a few levels though, and while he's there he's certainly fun. An extremely easy and effective way to get rid of enemies maybe, but fun. Mindlessly and constantly tapping the B button makes using Yoshi WAY too easy. You'll find out what I mean when you play the game. Otherwise I can take or leave him. The powerups are somewhat cool, such as the boulder that can charge into (and break) heavy objects. I like this one the most because crashing into objects feels impactful and adrenaline-rushing. There's a boulder level where you have to jump over a series of platforms and it's probably going to result in over 100 deaths until you complete it. This is all because of one tricky part at the very end where you have to roll into a bouncy thing that makes you go in a completely different direction, and then forward up the path to the star. You have to accomplish this without rolling off the side. It's incredibly hard believe me. Some people complain about the stiff controls, but to me it's understandable that controlling a boulder would be difficult. The drill is alright I guess. You can dig through the soil and land on the other side of the planet. This is used in a fairly clever way on a few occasions- you can take out enemies and bosses by popping out of the soil underneath their bodies for a nifty attack. However it's a severely limited powerup used mainly for just these two purposes. The honey bee makes a return as well, and it's exactly the same. With all this said, I REALLY don't understand what makes the cloud flower so appealing to the masses. It's really not that fun skipping through several portions of a level by creating/floating on clouds; just convenient. It's used WAY too many times throughout the game as well. Yes I realize the main purpose of the cloud flower is to be able to reach the really high or far out areas needed to collect certain important items, but come on, it's definitely not very exciting to actually *use* and fans are clearly overrating it. Perhaps the ice flower not being included this time around is a minor disappointment because it was pretty fun bouncing off walls and waterfalls with it, but at least the classic fire flower has remained. I enjoy the return of the hammer brothers even if they only appear in a few spots. They're much easier to handle in a 3D environment since the main challenge you faced in the older games was making sure you were able to successfully jump over (or run under) them without eating a hammer for your troubles. Now you can simply counter their moves by walking to their side (thank you 3D world!) and spin attacking them into pieces, easily avoiding the tossed hammers.

Like I mention above, those dreaded purple coin missions are back and you may have already guessed- some of them are really a chore and time-consuming to play. One mission (Flip-Swap Galaxy) has Mario flipping through platforms while trying to avoid electric beams and rolling chomp heads which is a REALLY high challenge that requires accuracy of the highest extent. You can't make a single mistake either. In another level (Clockwork Ruins Galaxy) Mario collects coins while riding a few clockwise-rotating wooden or stone structure, and what makes it annoying is the way the rotation plays tricks with your mind- you WILL mess up, slide off and fall to your death. Guaranteed. Oh and what's now considered one of the hardest levels of all-time from the first Galaxy (Luigi's Purple Coins) returns, however now it's been dumbed down- the golden platforms no longer flip over. It still has the ""step onto once and they disappear for good"" green platforms, however. More or less the same idea returns, but now it's tame in comparison. The purple coins are easily within reach now. They threw in Mario clones (enemies that follow Mario's every movement- don't touch them) but they hardly ever interfere with your focus to collect the coins. I guess Nintendo received some hate mail from fans voicing their displeasure with the trickiness of Luigi's Purple Coins so they toned it down for the sequel, haha. The Yoshi mad dash purple coin mission in Starshine Beach Galaxy is fun but it's over before you can even blink your eyes, and the one purple coin mission where you're underground and encouraged to move quickly in order to avoid the Mario clones and grab the bunches of coins grouped together sitting on the small steps is another *extremely* short one. We're talking less than 30 seconds here for *both* missions. Not sure why the latter even exists- it's practically the definition of bland.

Let's not kid ourselves however- the hardest stage by FAR (called Grandmaster Galaxy) is 100% guaranteed to have gamers pulling the precious hair out of their head. You have to go through six EXTREMELY difficult portions of the stage without taking a SINGLE hit. Let's break down how challenging this really is. First you have to carefully twirl your way around several floating rocks, paragoombas and torpedoes with Yoshi's tongue while being in the air the whole time, then you must step on several extra large blue platforms and make them turn yellow in order to open the launch star without eating two homing electric beams for your troubles, then you must make several cloud flowers and float over a series of electric beams that occupy the top and bottom of the screen with a few tricky spots in between, then you must properly figure your way through a series of red/blue flipping platforms while avoiding homing fireballs, laser rings and more electric beams (INCREDIBLY hard)... then you find yourself surrounded by even MORE trickily placed electric beams and paragoombas using the pull stars, and the hardest part of all comes last- dealing with quite a few insistently vicious hammer and boomerang brothers. Luck is pretty much the only way you'll make your way through a neverending swarm of spinning boomerangs and hammers in the final segment. In fact these obstacles are so difficult I just pretend the daredevil portion of this stage doesn't exist and settle with 241 stars. If you know what's good for your sanity, you'll take my advice and avoid this stage like the plague. It makes the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2/Lost Levels a cakewalk in comparison. The good news is that you're given the option to play through this stage the normal way (without the ""one hit you're dead"" way) which is STILL really hard regardless.

The good news is that the very best level in the game hands down smears ALL the levels from the first Super Mario Galaxy- Tall Trunk's Purple Coin mission. This is easily the most exciting and coolest level ever for a Mario game. It's a fast-paced race... on feet! Is it sort of challenging properly landing your jumps, avoiding crawling wigglers and collecting enough coins? Absolutely. Is it fun? Absolutely! I'm also rather fond of a few mini games. The 5,000-point boulder/bowling mini game is a highlight, and especially the ones where you have to jump on enemies heads and produce enough points to reach 10,000. These ones in particular are *awesome* and a very useful way of temporarily bringing back the point system. I never cared for gaining enough points in the older Mario games since the only reward was achieving a really high score and bragging rights for beating your friends record highs, but now -with this challenge- there's a clear and exciting purpose in getting enough points. There's a 10,000 point mini game in the water where you can ride a koopa shell and destroy ghosts and weeds that's equally as much fun. The ice skating point games involving a monkey are pretty cool (but the second one that requires 600 points is WAY too hard). I also really love the missions where you only have less than a minute to take out a pack of octoombas in Shiverburn and Flash Black Galaxy. On the negative, I really miss the cosmic Luigi races from the first SMG game. They sort of remind me of Super Mario Kart but on feet. Also, the robot mini games this time around are honestly rather simple- you have to destroy a bunch of crates using a fire flower in under 30 seconds. A shallow game compared to the demanding bomb-tossing accuracy and short time limit that the robot requires out of the player in the first Super Mario Galaxy."
105359,3,"First of all, Medal of Honor Airborne only has six missions to play in and that is it. The game should have had at least twelve missions to play in it to be called a full version game. This game is suppose to be a full version game. Not a add-on or an expansion game. I feel like I have been ripped off by someone.

Of the six missions, only the first four missions honor the brave soldiers that fought in World War II. The last two missions do not honor the brave soldiers who fought during World War II. The last two missions are fantasy made missions that remind me of going to amusement park. You have super Nazi's in the last two missions that take forever to kill. Shoot them in the head or blow them up with grenades it doesn't do any good. It takes at least fifty to a hundred shots with your weapon to take down one of these super Nazi's. I felt like I needed to find a super weapon like a laser gun to bring them down.

I notice in the fifth mission (Operation Varsity) there are railroad cars that are not European made rail cars. They are North American made railroad cars. What is up with that? It is quite obvious that somebody just slapped some North American railroad cars into the mission just to finish it.

In the last mission, (Operation Der Flakturm) American paratroopers land on a German Flak tower in Germany right after Operation Varsity. This mission never took place during World War II. The Russians were the only ones to assault German Flak towers during the war. In fact, the Flak tower used in the game never even got built in Germany. There was three generations of Flak towers built by the Germans during the war and only the first two generations of towers were built in Germany. Those towers were built in the German cities of Berlin and Hamburg during the war. The game shows a third generation built Flak tower built in Germany, that was actually built in Vienna, Austria during the war. Somebody screwed up.

It almost seems like two different teams of game developers work on the Medal of Honor Airborne game. One team worked on the first four missions of the game which were realistic and actually happen during World War II while another team worked on the last two missions in the game which are more sci-fi and fantasy. I really wanted to like this game because I'm a big World War II fan. With all the actual events that happen during World War II, why would the game developer need to makeup any missions for the game?

This another example of a game that should of went somewhere that ended up going nowhere. Either the game publisher or the game developer just wanted to hurry and finish the game just to try to beat the holiday rush. Somebody was trying to hurry and make some money on this game before the other big name titles come out later on this year. I hate to say it, but Call of Duty 4 is going to be the game to beat this year."
147817,3,"This game is very fun.  But anyone can beat it in 1 or 2 days.  It's not a traditional Resident Evil game.  Things have changed.  The Zombies are more intelligent and guess what...They can talk, shoot, just about anything.  Are they still zombies...nope.  The end comes at you faster  than you might expect.  I bought it on Friday night and ended on Sunday afternoon.  There will be a patch.  A patching of a sorts to fight ones comrades.  Fun and bumming at the same time.  Things graphically look great.  Mobility is flustering at times.  The game play, all in all, is a cinema walk threw.  Have a great time playing it."

I know that Ubi has in-game advertising in some of it's newer games and I am wondering if they have done this in Wolves of the Pacific as well.  If they have not I will buy this game.  I have decided not to spend thousands on a new gaming rig just to make it possible for marketing jerks to desecrate my PC with advertising trash.  Thanks."
247006,3,"Not a bad game, just younger than I expected. Each level was pretty redundant and all the areas were the same as the rest. No real challenge to the puzzles. It was OK at first until I realized nothing was really different from one level to the other."

It is.
Really, that's all I have to say.

68011,3,"I picked this up down the street used for around 6 bucks.  That's about what it's worth.  It's just a boring shooter.  I mean, back in the day, when 3-D graphics were new, ""Quake"" was just awesome.  It was the game to beat.  But these days - with every single game being some form of 3-D immersion, the coolness of Quake has long since vanished.
-
It's a boring shooter.  I didn't think any of the weapons, or their subsequent upgrades, were that good.  I rarely used the top gun - that dark matter one - it's just weak.  So many other games have had so many cooler and better weapons.  The graphics are fine - but what game isn't these days?  I felt the game was far too difficult.  There are so few health paks around, you die all the time.  I got pretty frustrated with it and looked up the cheat codes online and blew through it in under a week.  It just wasn't engaging or rewarding enough to fight through waves of aliens or zombie-people or whatever to play it as-is.  It did have a bit of a dark side to it, which was neat.  But this game is, at the outset, utterly forgettable."
270266,3,"Beautiful scenery and graphics, solid gameplay, but terrible logic.  You might wander around for a week trying to fulfill a mission because it's not clearly explained.  Guards attack me for no reason, even when I'm in good standing.  Killed the governor with six guards attacking me, it switches to a cutscene, then the guards are magically gone.  The game logic is really missing QA.  But it's a fun game to play on a portable device.  Consider buying Uncharted: Golden Abyss rather than this."
231806,3,"So please don't think that I'm just creating this review at random.

The game is definitely interesting and held a lot of promise, it allows you to explore/destroy/alter an entire island (which is very expansive). You can drive cars, fly planes, etc, etc. However, I didn't really care for the story and the controls felt a little wonky. The coolest feature for this game, besides the open world, is the grappling hook your character uses. You can quickly travel between points that your grappling hook can reach, and seemingly defy gravity as if you shoot your grappling hook into the ground from several stories above you race down to the ground with no damage done.

Also, I would periodically get motion sickness from this game. I don't understand how this kept happening as I've played GTA and Saints Row on the several different platforms and have yet to consistently get motion sickness.

I wouldn't recommend buying this game if you're prone to motion sickness as it might induce it. Even if there was a fix for this game to reduce/eliminate motion sickness I doubt I'd apply it as I wasn't very impressed with the game."
229484,3,"I was a fan of Red Dawn so when I first saw the trailer for HOMEFRONT, I got pretty excited.  I loved how they worked in real news footage and current events to build out this terrifying vision of the future.  Scattered throughout the game are dated newspapers that you can read to piece together the chain of political, economic, and military events that led up to the events in the game.  The cut scenes do an amazing job of setting the scene and explaining the cool backstory and premise.  Some of the scenes are actually pretty disturbing and kind of get your patriotic blood boiling.

The single player campaign is very short.  Most people have said about 5 hours, which is about right.  Steam reports that I took 4 hours to beat my first play through.  This includes time reading a few newspapers and reloading several levels.

While most gamers will probably get the most value out of multiplayer, I feel that a game with such a rich backstory should have had a really solid single player campaign.  Unfortunately, in terms of gameplay, HOMEFRONT is pretty standard for a modern shooter.  All the common gameplay ""variations"" are here, including the hectic machine-gun-on-a-truck stages, the ""Modern Warfare"" helicopter stages, the play-a-sniper levels, and the find-the-explosives-to-kill-a-tank sequences.  You get to briefly control a manic, robotic tank called Goliath, but it really just felt like a minor twist to classic air strike level.  I felt like I had played many of these levels before in Modern Warfare, Call of Duty, and Battlefield 2.

Also, I don't think the single player campaign did enough to take advantage of this foreign invasion premise.  There should have been more guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and espionage.  Instead, your ragtag team of resistance fighters will repeatedly assault heavily fortified enemy positions.  Maybe what I really wanted were more RPG elements.  HOMEFRONT could have been an amazing FPRPG.

The game isn't bad though.  The regular gunfights were fun and I really liked that you could only carry a few clips of ammo at a time.  Ammo felt precious, but never scarce.  For most of the guns, you only get about 90 rounds before you have to run around scrounging for more ammo.  I found myself dropping and picking up guns constantly to make sure that I had enough to get through the next battle.  Also, I think the developers realized that nobody actually likes the machine-gun-on-a-truck levels so they made them really easy and quick.

I actually liked the final battle and felt like I had accomplished something pretty major.  The game ends in such a way that they could easily make sequels, so I'm hoping that HOMEFRONT 2 will have a little more depth and actually do something cool with the premise."
26607,3,I recently bought this game after losing the PC version. I was extremely disapointed to find out IT HAD NO ONLINE PLAY and had a lot less maps than the PC version. The game felt very limited compared to the PC version. I know its a classic but if you have a decent computer you should skip this and buy the version for the computer.
172353,3,"i play this game when i get pissed off by super street fighter 4, i jump right in select urs and commence with the destruction of my opponents. Urs weilds a chainsaw motorcycle and he is devestatingly powerful it's a simple a quarter circle back attack and shoryuken motion attack and you've got an instant 10 hit combo from the go. The other characters are decent and other SF archetypes, they're all here aside from dhalsim and blanka type characters. The story is nonsensical at best but i don't think it ever intended to be high calibur stuff, if you're looking for a distraction from the mainstream fighters out there give this one a whirl it's simple enough to keep me contented for hours"

319459,3,"Bought it for my nephew.  He loved it.  Packaging was taped together when it was delivered, which was displeasing.  Also disappointed that the character in-game doesn't have the pumpkin head like this figure does, the in-game character still has the eyeball head."
32256,3,"After reading the previews and comments of other Amazon customers, this sounded like a game I couldn't live without.  I bought it without trying it first, and it was the first time that I have regretted a game purchase on my Xbox system.  The game has okay graphics, but the vehicle physics are somewhat lame (even for an arcade game), the gameplay is redundant and the only 2 standard controller schematics that they allow are both poor.  I played the game through all of the ""X"" tests, which prime you for the actual game, and even after getting used to the controls & handling of the car I didn't have much fun with it.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that the tests are much more fun than the actual game itself.  The game's concept is a good one, but the gamplay just falls short IMHO.  I only gave it a ""3"" rating because it's not a terrible game, and some people may actually find it to be a fun game.  But my copy is going on e-bay..."
13834,3,"Storyline-wise..this game is very atmospheric and at many times, dark. I enjoyed the story and atmosphere highly, but the game seems to stretch on and on into dungeons that highly resemble the previous ones, thus making it very monotonous. The weapons configuration also is very lacking, there are many weapons and other equipment, but it really gets on your nerves and many times, is quite lame. The difficulty level, while hard, is actually very good, although I find myself constantly battling to defeat bosses, and the whole risk facto system is constantly getting on my nerves. If the developers cranked out some of the faults in this games system this would have potential to be a very great game. However, this game would be a good investment for an RPG if you are able to look past its faults. But otherwise, I would suggest 'Final Fantasy Tactics' which is made by the same developer..."

50621,3,"I haven't played a Sim City game since SimCity 2000.  I was just a kid then, but I was still able to maintain some stability with the cities, even though most of my zoned buildings ended up abandoned quickly.

I played SimCity3000 for a few hours shortly after, and now close to 10 years later I've tried SimCity4 in earnest.

It is frustrating.  Since the last time I played a Sim City game, I had spent dozens of hours in ancient city-builder games like Caesar III, Pharaoh, Zeus Master of Olympus, and Emperor Rise of the Middle Kingdom.  In those games, I am used to zoning housing, and building everything that is needed.

I'm not sure if it has always been this way with Sim City, but a sizeable portion of the gameplay involves doing nothing but zoning.  I made the early mistake of thinking my people deserved good things like good hospitals, schools, technology, and such, only to discover I was crashing in debt quickly, and the people didn't seem to care.

So to keep a stable city going, all you really need to do is zone.  Zone residential for 80% of the map, zone commercial nearby, zone industrial far away, but not that far.  Wait.  Zone some more.  Wait.  Zone.  Wait.  Wait.  Build some necessities (police, fire, hospital, education, utilities).  Wait.

A full 50% of the game is just zoning and waiting for the zoned areas to develop.  The other 50% is staring at the budget and engaging in a constant battle to balance the budget, to maintain more income than expenditures.  Just like in real life, people are ungrateful little pigs who whine and complain about the slightest of tax increases to prevent your utilities from collapsing due to debt, then whine and complain because the water budget has been cut and now the pipes aren't as strong.

Maybe it's too realistic for me or I'm just not used to it, but I found myself becoming infuriated with my people.  Not because they complain about tax rates, but because they seem to not be doing anything to help me help them.  EVERY TIME I zone commercial areas and they build up, the businesses have Crime: Low, Pollution: Low,  Customers: Low.

No matter what, no matter how large the population, no matter how many roads (not streets) connect them, ALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES HAVE LOW CUSTOMERS.  No one seems to be doing anything to help these businesses, and they stagnate, never generating more tax income over years.  After enough years, the businesses go out of business and the buildings are abandoned.  Similarly, if I cut the water budget and some houses lose water for more than a month, the buildings are abandoned.

Another big problem involves neighboring cities; the only ones you can interact with are the ones directly beside you in either directions.  You can't have business deals with a city two blocks away, or across the river, which is utterly ridiculous.

Landmarks seem to provide nothing at all; things like the Living Mall don't work as malls, and they produce zero income, and zero bonuses to tourism.

The Rush Hour expansion adds some fun features, like being able to drive vehicles directly in your city, and suffer the horrifyingly bad road and highway network you've set up first-hand.  You can do missions that actually affect the city-building aspect (such as foiling enough crimes to have the city support a Deluxe Police Station, or help a group of scientists so they establish a disease research center).

Despite the amount of problems I have with this game, I always end up coming back, wanting to try and explore more, only to be reduced back to the monotonous schedule of waiting, zoning, waiting, and waiting more.  The budget is so damn fickle that I hesitate just to build anything other than Zoning because it will add more maintenance costs that the tax rates never manage to cover.

Also the biggest problem with Windows 7:  The game randomly closes.  Doesn't matter what you do, where you are, what you're playing, the game will abruptly stutter for half a second, then apparently crash, or close down.  No error message, no freezing, no white tint and ""SimCity4 has encountered an error"" with the loading screen to submit problem to Microsoft.  It just closes as if you'd hit Alt + F4.  The game doesn't autosave at all, so if you don't save frequently, you'll lose everything."

56483,3,"This is my first experience with the Budokai series - my only previous DBZ games have been the Tenkaichi variety (I know I can't spell these words to save my life..).

Overall, I see what they tried to do with the game - recreating the actual experience found from the show is somewhat achieved.  Unfortunately this doesn't necessarily make the gaming experience fun for me.  For example; I don't know why suddenly every ""ultimate"" type move requires punting your opponent prior to the animation beginning - whether it be a dragon rush or just a finishing move @ full power.  I found it incredibly annoying that I cannot launch one of these moves without being 1 foot away from my opponent.

The transformations are cool, but again, I found it really annoying to fight out an entire battle, get myself into the form I want, only to die one combo later.  It just seems like a lot of effort with little reward.

One other thing I had an issue with is the control scheme.  I understand there is a lot going on here, but for example, I much rather have my Ki button @ L2 like in the Tenkaichi games (again, I know I can't spell it..).  There seems like there is little flow to the button layout minus the kick/punch.  These also felt less responsive to me than in the Tenkaichi games.

Overall, I'm glad I purchased it after all these years and will likely load it up from time to time as I do see there being some good things to experience.  However, I believe this is inferior to the other DBZ games I already own."
288707,3,"I'll be honest. It's hard to even give this product 2.5 stars. But let's start at the beginning.

Opening the box is a simple affair. Two seals on either end of the box and you're in.

Inside the box is the keyboard, a wrist rest, and a wall plug. That's it.

Setting the keyboard up is very easy. If you want to use just the keyboard, you don't need to use the wall plug. But if you want to use the built-in LCD screen, you'll need to have wall-power. Given how tiny the LCD screen is, I'm somewhat surprised Logitech couldn't have gotten the screen to work with USB power. In addition, you can't even use the keyboard backlight without wall power.

Build Quality:

This is where I started to get worried.

First, the keyboard is an all-plastic affair. Not necessarily a terrible thing, but for the price this keyboard costs the cheap feel is incredibly surprising. It weighs less than my Logitech G710+ keyboard which doesn't even have an LCD! The LCD screen is covered in plastic, surrounded by plastic, makes a plastic-y creaking sound when you adjust the angle, and it sits on a plastic bar (colored silver to make you think it's metal or aluminum or something...).

Speaking of disheartening moments, I noticed my LCD had some factory scratches in the plastic coating, and several pieces of factory dust/grime under the plastic, in the LCD, which of course can't be removed.

Moving on to the keys themselves:

The space bar on my particular G19s has quite a bit of wobble to it. Every time I press it (typing this review), it doesn't convey a quality key press. All the keys exhibit this ""wobble,"" but the space bar, being so large, feels the most at risk and disjointed.

The typing experience itself isn't all bad, but isn't great, either. I currently own the Logitech G710+ as well, so I'm able to directly compare the typing experience on that vs the G19s. First, inexplicably, the G19s does not have mechanical keys unlike the G710+, which does. For a quality gaming keyboard with this price-tag, this is unforgivable. With that out of the way, let me state the following:

With the G19s, the ONLY thing you're paying for is that LCD screen. Aside from a few gaming-related keys, the rest of the keyboard is as generic as it comes.

So let's talk about that LCD screen..

Out of the box, you can select gaming profiles with it (be sure to have Logitech's software installed). This was frustrating since you can't scroll through the games list by holding down a button. You have to tap, tap, tap, tap to get through the games. You can also see your CPU usage, or a handy clock, watch videos on it (why?) but only if they're in the required folder, or see a feed from your webcam on it. The webcam feed didn't work very well for me, only refreshing the image it was seeing very infrequently. I was momentarily excited to see YouTube in the apps list for the LCD, but even then - picking a video just gave me the option of opening it in my browser. What's the point, then? Apparently there's a way (with macros) to get YouTube videos to play on the tiny LCD, but I really can't see why you'd bother.

Honestly, I'm a gamer, and unless you really need a clock or your CPU usage open all the time while you're in game, the LCD is pretty useless. In time, there may be decent third-party apps for it that come out for individual games, but I find the likelihood of this to be low given the price-point and how niche this device is. (The G19 keyboard has been around for a while, and there's still hardly any apps for it. I suspect the G19s will suffer the same fate.)

Speaking of quality issues, the LCD has other problems: There are some directional buttons right next to it so you can scroll through the apps list. My buttons require a VERY firm push to work. If you press them, they click but do nothing. If you press them FIRMLY, they click and actually do something.

The keyboard backlight:

My G710+ only has one keyboard backlight color. White. However, it has four brightness levels, and you can even independently change the brightness of the WASD and arrow keys separate to the rest of the keyboard. Excellent design for gaming! The G19s, however, has no such thing. You can change the colors of the keys, - full RGB configuration. However, there's only one brightness level (on or off!), and it's for ALL the keys. More importantly, it's simply not bright enough. I compared my G710+ to the G19s, and the G19s backlight brightness is the same as the G710+ at its LOWEST level. Bear in mind, the G710+ doesn't need any external power, and still is infinitely brighter than the G19s. The reason for this is simple: The G710+ has individual LEDs under each key, and the G19s does not, despite costing more than the G710+ and not having mechanical keys... Why?

Overall, I have to say I'm really frustrated with the Logitech G19s gaming keyboard. It's excruciatingly priced, poorly constructed, with some omissions that gamers really enjoy about the Logitech G710+, and additions that I find it hard to believe many gamers will care about.

Pretty much the only interesting addition to the G19s is the two high-speed powered USB ports on the front of the keyboard so you can connect peripherals. But the list of things I'd rather have on this keyboard is simply huge...

To summarize:

FAR too expensive, under-featured, quality-control issues, no mechanical keys, low backlight brightness, mostly pointless LCD.

2.5 stars out of 5. Not recommended. Get the G710+ instead."
414993,3,"I have to admit, Ive always been a fan of the Final Fantasy series. Whether its the battle style, the music or just the feel of the games as a whole Im not certain, but theyve always held a special place in my video game collection. The spin-offs are a bit of a different story, however. Needless to say, when I heard that Explorers was going to be a game in a similar vein to the Monster Hunter series, a series I have pumped over six hundred hours into cumulatively, I was really looking forward to it.

I tend to view the spin-offs as a hit or miss sort of deal. Some spin-offs, like Dirge of Cerberus I really enjoyed, whereas Dissidia and Theatrhythm I wasn't fond of, despite the fact I prefer fighting and rhythm games to shooters. For those who don't have any basic Monster Hunter knowledge, the game basically consists of accepting quests to go defeat either X number of small things or one to three large things. You then embark on a journey to go hunt down and beat up whatever creature suits your fancy or has been demanded of you. You are given a time limit, usually between half an hour to an hour, in which to incapacitate your prey before your time runs out. In Explorers you have two basic methods of attack: standard attacks and skill attacks. Standard attacks use whatever weapon you have equipped to deal damage to your enemies (or your fists if no weapon is equipped). These attacks do less damage than skills, but may be used in quick succession and restore a chunk of stamina. Skill attacks take a chunk of stamina and tend to have lengthier cooldowns, but do much more damage, or buff/heal. Your stamina is represented as a nice yellow bar sitting just under your health gauge, and will deplete every time you run or use a skill. Stamina can be recovered either while not running or by smacking an enemy with the standard attack. Its at this point that I discovered my first major issue with Explorers.

When I first picked up explorers, I had two other friends who were playing, and both decided to go with melee classes, so I thought Great! Ill play a dedicated red mage, or the closest class where I can be both support and damage based magic!. Unfortunately, neither of them actually ended up playing with me (T_T). The classes can be easily divided into either melee or ranged, and are unlocked through either quest progression or random arbitrary tasks, such as crafting half your inventory holding space worth of equipment at the blacksmith. Classes can, for the most part, equip any armour set, and don't affect your melee combos, so the only thing the classes really do is affect base stats and restrict weapon usage. My issue, however, is the stamina consumption associated with magic based classes, especially once you get later into the game. All those aga spells? They take progressively larger chunks out of your stamina in order to use as you sort-of-kinda upgrade them, which Ill get to in a minute. Makes sense, right? Well, it would if the stamina bar didn't replenish at a rate similar to the Game of Thrones release schedule, the books not the show.

As a mage, I can get into a boss fight and expend my entire stamina pool in about thirty seconds, which really doesnt work so well when the only way to dodge attacks is to run, which takes stamina. As a point of reference, to cast a spell again from zero stamina would take me about seven to ten seconds of standing around not running in order to regain enough stamina to cast a damaging spell, even with haste speeding up my stamina recovery. So what about the standard attacks? Well, Id like to see you smack a boss in the rump with a book corner without getting hit for about two thirds your entire health when the enemy decides he isn't so fond of where youve stuck your literature. To make matters worse, the smack only hit for about three damage on a critical, so it isn't like an enemy is really going to be bleeding from the standard attacks, and the return rate is only two hundred points per standard attack, where the spells cost two hundred and fifty plus stamina to use. The only real option left is mass ether usage. While melee builds manage this better, depending on class choice and play style, the stamina regeneration rate may literally kill you.

As I mentioned earlier, there is an upgrade system to the skills. In town, you can pay crystal points that you earn through monster subjugation in order to either buy or upgrade skills. Heres where my second major gripe comes in. Unlocking of skills is a fairly sequential process: buy lower rank skills and progress story in order to buy the next rank. So now you want to upgrade the skills. Well then, go out into the field, keep using skills until the resonance gauge hits at least one hundred points. Now you have to keep it above one hundred points for about ten seconds or so, and tada!, you now have a crystal surge available. The higher your resonance level, the more crystal surges will be available to activate, where you can have a maximum of four to choose from with four hundred or more resonance. Resonance can go past four hundred points, however even after hitting eight hundred during one fight I didn't really notice any change with the speed or quality of the crystal surges. So, now that you have enough resonance to use a crystal surge, how do you choose which crystal surge to use? You dont. Crystal surges are completely random, and your only option is to take one of the choices given to you or wait until the surges refresh, which I personally found to be rather sporadic, as sometimes the surges list would refresh while I was looking at them, and other times it felt like it took ten minutes before I had new options to pick from.

So, now that youve got your crystal surges, which one does what? Well, you're going to have to guess based on the name. This ranges from easy, such as fire affinity to downright near impossible, like: tonberry karma, undermine, damage screen, agony, angels litany (which is float, apparently), fleeting dream, moments respite (which isn't healing like I expected), rock bottom and twofold return. Pro tip for any aspiring mages who pick up the game, twofold return is permanent reflect for literally everything with a health bar in the area. Needless to say, I wasn't too pleased when I accidentally slapped myself in the face with a blizzaga, froze myself, and then got hit with the boss super move, effectively killing me from full health in all of three seconds. Whats even better is that most of these urges have two possible mutations that can occur, and only at a chance, not even assured. After you finally manage to learn a mutated skill, you can then go examine the crystal in town to pay to be able to use the mutated skill, in exchange for CP, more stamina consumption and a higher equip burden.

Yes, thats right, skills have equip burdens. This is especially noticed in magic combat, because as soon as you hit the next rank of monsters, you need to use higher-level spells to do any damage. Well, choose two, cuz thats how much available burden youll have. While it may slow down your combat, its not too bad for fights where you know the elemental weakness of the enemy, assuming that theres only one enemy or the second one shares the same weaknesses, but for enemies like Fenrir, Bahamut or Odin? Guess and hope your spells will do more than tickle nose. Combat is made a little more manageable through the trance gauge, which fills up when damage is dealt or received in combat, presumably. When the gauge is full, you enter trance mode by tapping a button on the touch screen, and assuming you haven't just accidentally enlarged the map instead of activating trance mode, you can use the special skill of an equipped crystal housing one of the Eidolon boss powers, or a previous Final Fantasy character, such as Squall, Yuna or Lightning. Trance mode also fully restores all your health and stamina, so its a good idea to use when you're either almost dead or fed up with being unable to hurt your target. The special skill is activated as a crystal surge, assuming you manage to refresh the crystal surge list before your trance time ends, and is usually a powerful move where you cannot be killed while using it, although you can still take damage. One of the nice effects of equipping the character-based crystals is that both your appearance and the battle music will change to reflect that of the character crystal you have equipped.

In addition to the option of heading out solo adventuring, you might be lucky enough to pick up Altamiths of defeated common enemies. With these Altamiths, you can summon monsters to go adventuring with you, or send them out on real-time based missions. These monsters also have their own levels and equip burden, and will level as you take them on quests with you. Equip burden is a flat three hundred points, and monsters can range from one hundred to three hundred points needed to take them with you. The effectiveness of the monsters issomewhat hit and miss. On the one hand, they can be wonderful taunts, and bosses or mobs can focus on them while you pound the life out of them from behind. On the other hand, they can get really annoying when you are trying to encase an eidolon, which you need to do in order to use the eidolons power, and the eidolon either runs off to slap your monster/s, or gets killed halfway through your encase animation. Since encasing can only be done when an eidolon has really low health, needs to be used as a crystal surge, takes about five whole seconds for the animation to complete and needs to be done at point blank range, I often found it a lot easier to simply have a character crystal equipped instead, unless I needed the eidolon as a crafting material. A great plus side to having the monsters fight with you is that they automatically revive when they die after a set period of time, making both training the monsters and their combat usefulness really skyrocket.

Explorers definitely is not a fast-paced game, and this fact is reflected in both the combat and in map movement. Combat is slowed down mostly by the slowly regenerating stamina rate, turning most boss fights into glorified damage sponges, making them more of a race against the clock than a test of skill or over-leveling. This is only exacerbated by the fact that every time you die, it normally costs five minutes off your timer to resurrect if you don't use a phoenix pinion. Expect to die a lot, by the way, because there are a lot of moves that bosses can pull that will either be impossible to dodge or just instantly kill you. Map traversal is a prime offender though, as some quests will involve you fighting multiple bosses/enemies in different areas, or will task you with reaching two areas on the map. When you first start a quest, you can choose a large area to start in, after youve completed a certain quest. This will speed up single area travel time, but for multiple map locations, movement can be a real big nuisance. Traversing the exploration map wouldnt be so bad if there were only the central areas and one-off side segments, but each time you want to go to a central area or side segment, you first need to travel through three smaller mini-maps, whose only purpose seems to be either a result of wanting to artificially increase time spent in the field, or from someone on the dev team saying I want to include these harvest-able items but I don't know where to put them. Even reducing the intermediary areas to only one mini-map area, the problem would be so much less of an issue than it currently is.

In terms of length, the game doesnt take long to get through the main story, if you can even call it a story. Basically, you're an explorer. You want to find a grand crystal to prove you're worth/masculinity/woman-power. Great, join the other people on the island to find the grand crystal that you totally cant see immediately after entering the first area, but which is conveniently blocked by a barrier that no one seems to notice. The quests are ranked based on stars, each rank of which takes about an hour to complete, including weapon/armor material farming, so don't expect a whole lot of volume out of the game, especially considering there are only about ten or so available quests for each rank, some of which literally take less than two minutes to complete. Im currently on the eight star quests with seven and a half hours logged, so I must be almost on the nine stars at this rate. As a point of reference (SPOILERS) the end of the game happens at the end of the five star quests (END SPOILERS), so everything after the last boss is basically just there are things to kill, so hop to it, despite the fact that there isn't really anything new added except the enemies getting stronger and dropping rarer materials.

The graphics aren't exactly anything to write home about, they're about what Ive come to expect from a 3DS game at this point, nor do they try to go above or beyond what the standard quality is for 3DS games nowadays. Apart from the Eidolon intro cinematics, there aren't really any other cinematics, and most of the areas didn't really stand out to me as either especially well designed or nicely rendered. The quality is about on par with the Final Fantasy III remake for the DS that came out some time ago. The soundtrack isn't bad, and I especially enjoyed the battle themes, despite the fact that most of the fight music overshadowed by the sound effects as the default volume setting. I really appreciated the remixes for the Gilgamesh and Omega fights, pulling out those soundtracks that were at the root of the series really brought on the  nostalgia that Ive begun to search more for in the Final Fantasy series as the years progress. The added touch of changing the battle theme to match the character crystal during trance was also a really nice throwback to hear.

Overall, Explorers could have been a really great game, but it just felt incredibly underwhelming and, quite frankly, sort of boring. While as a stand-alone game it isn't necessarily a bad game, it was certainly really underwhelming and I was rather disappointed based on what I was expecting from the game. If you're either a fan of the Final Fantasy series as a whole or a fan of Monster Hunter style games, you might find it as an adequate tide-over game until the next Final Fantasy or Monster Hunter release, but otherwise its a game I would suggest looking into a lot more before deciding on a purchase."
170279,3,"I've only ever owned DDR previously for my Xbox (minus the 360) - but I owned all 4 games that came out on that platform, and was getting pretty close to mastering them all. When I upgraded to an Xbox 360, I decided to get the latest DDR for it as well, and well...it's frustrating.

It seems like the Konami folks have yet to master the perfect puzzle of what fans are looking for. I like the fact the game is challenging in the sense there are all kinds of ways to play it with all sorts of bonuses and mini-games, but not when those challenges feel unattainable.

My least favourite part of the Xbox DDR games was doing the dancing challenges (ex: get a perfect score on 10 bars of a song), and they've unfortunately transformed the quest mode, my previous fave part of DDR 4 on Xbox, into challenge mode. The level one challenges and level one dance-offs are pretty fun (and more interesting than what DDR 4 ever was on Xbox), but beyond that the game is pretty impossible. Dancing without the arrow guides? Arrows disappearing right before you're supposed to step? Sped up arrows? Only stepping on indistinguishable 'quarter note' arrows? It's frustrating and no longer fun, and also very time-consuming to get in and out of challenges.

Additionally the play lists aren't as diverse - at least not from what I've played and unlocked. The original DDR games featured classic disco tunes, modern hip hop and pop, the best of the electronica world, some fun ethnic-inspired tunes, and a bunch of random Asian techno acts for an eclectic but balanced mix. This latest addition to the series has a very limited number of familiar songs, and the rest kind of overlap - nothing really stands out for me.

Some fun new stuff? The party mode games are pretty fun, although likely a product of the first two Xbox 360 DDR games and not really new. Shopping for clothes for your so-called customizable dancer is fun and interesting. I like the 'bonus stage' in the regular game mode where you dance to earn a new song (however challenging it may be). The dance-offs in quest mode are way more fun than the challenges. The workout mode just attaches itself to whatever mode you're playing in to let you know how many calories you burnt at any one point.

Overall though, I'm sadly disappointed with this DDR, and wondering if Konami will ever get it right..."
198601,3,"I had my hopes up that this battery would last much longer than the one I replaced, but I was a bit let down.  I bought a used DSi and the battery live was abyssmal.  I figured this would give it the juice I needed but it turned out to be a disappointment.  Only lasts a couple hours before it dies, was hoping for more like 8 hours.  No dice."
480584,3,"Well that was a fun blast from the past when I was really into RTS games, and I finished the four short campaigns, and the first couple dozen challenges, but I finally quit and uninstalled the game because it's too difficult to play.  No, it's not conceptually difficult, but unlike many RTS games, the user interface makes vast areas of the map, on the main screen or the heads-up overview display, un-addressable to the mouse pointer, making quick moves endlessly frustrating and further progress for me impossible.  Other games have been designed far better.  In fact most that I've played including the classic Command and Conquer Red Alert 2.

So, no more wasting time on this.  Life is too short to struggle with some game maker's bad interface design.  On to other things."

26999,3,"OK, the XBox rocks, the graphics are killer, but there is more to games. Thunder 2002 has great graphics, but could have been alot better.
After a race some hightlights are shown, should have been able to view a replay, I would think a better GUI would have been possible, navigating the many menu's to get to where you want to go is a pain.
I won a few chapionships and unlocked custom cars which are available to you thru the ""Driver Select"" menu, not the Car Select menu? So you pick a custom car there, and you cannot pick a driver... You are now ""Unknown"" and all your stats and scores no longer bear your name. Great, all that work to unlock an anonymous thing. And if you save your carreer, turn off the power, load it back up, *poof* you can no longer access the great ""unknown"" driver.
Documentation is shallow. The unlocked cars are mentioned once saying they can be obtained, and that is it.
Special features and settings are not explained. Like the informative best line ( a line that shows where on the track to be to get best lap times ) has 3 colors, no explanation of the colors.
And are there is no Legend (top 10 players) that I can see, only the racing stats that get partially reset everytime you finish a year of racing.
When another player loads their game, the other players no longer exist in any stats.
The racing experience is great, but the game seems to be thrown together around a great driving engine."
10737,3,"I'm having great trouble recommending Grandia because of its tendency to become extremely boring. This happens for several reasons: first off, the game offers nil challenge - and I do mean none whatsoever. Secondly, the ""real"" story hardly unfolds until the latter part of the second disk. Meanwhile, the player is occupied with the various and sundry sidequests, like saving villages and defeating evil monsters - things that don't have any bearing at all to the central story.
The story itself, involving a lad named Justin who hopes to become a famous adventurer, relies heavily on the backstory, which in turn is very vague and muddled. The tale of the ancient empire of Angelou and its eventual fall due to the corruption of its people is hardly inspired. What keeps Grandia together, however, is the excellent characterization: the people of Grandia are convincingly human, if a bit mellow, though the awful voice acting spoils the effect of some of the key scenes.
Gameplay-wise, Grandia has some interesting ideas, but it executes them so they contribute to the tedium. For example, magic and special moves aren't gained when the character levels up: instead, each character can increase his proficiency with the various elements (fire, water, wind, and earth) and weapon types (swords, daggers, whips, projectiles, etc.), thus gaining attribute boosts and special moves. However, this interesting arrangement ultimately makes even the most routine battles longer since the characters are forced to cast magic as often as possible to increase their abilities.
The ability to see enemies in the dungeons (like in Chrono Cross) is also welcome, though enemies move extremely quickly and there is a whole lot of them, so you can expect to fight just as often as in any other RPG.
However, the actual battle system is very nicely done and becomes very intuitive with practice. In addition to the usual variables, the player must also take into account his distance to the target and its ""openness"", since the characters actually move around the battle field. Also, Grandia has a visual aid to help you figure out whose turn is next - the ""IP Gauge."" Being able to stun enemies and knock them back on this gauge - and get knocked back yourself - adds an element of strategy to every battle, which would be very nice if the game offered any challenge. As things are, the battle system goes to waste.
Graphically, Grandia is clean and bright, with colorful sprites on fully polygonal backgrounds. Unfortunately, some of the enemy sprites are less than pretty, and some magic spells are downright embarassing. There are some short bits of FMV, but the single anime sequence is repeated far too often.
Grandia might possibly be suited for young players who could appreciate the low challenge, whacky voice-overs, and charming story. Older gamers who are looking for a more purposeful adventure should look elsewhere."
109486,3,This review is from my 9 year old daughter...She loves Pokemon.  She likes Digimon.  This is her first Digimon game.  She really likes it overall though she maybe having some trouble figuring out some things in the game but I guess that comes with trial and error.  She would reccommend this game.
482678,3,"did not hold a charge for more than 2 hours... i guess that would have to do, since Nintendo discontinued the original battery pack."
296282,3,"I had hoped these characters could do more than just play in the toy box. I love these characters and the movie is fantastic, they just need a story to back them."
358946,3,"I have played most FPS games since 1990, including Battlefield. So far I played the game for 12 hours/30 mins lvl 36 and finished the campaign. Let's talk about campaign first since it was really fun.

The single player feels like Rainbow Six Vegas mixed with Splinter Cell. Stealth is the #1 priority, but you can go gun crazy if you like it that way. Story is interesting and it takes you to very exciting environments from deserts to swamps and mansions in LA. Graphics are ok, but it could be lot better for a 2015 video game.

Lets talk about Multiplayer NOW:

Graphics in MP are slightly tuned down due to lag and nasty problems that we had in BF4. The gameplay is fast-paced, don't expect something like BF4/3. If you have played BF3 Close Quarters DLC, you can get a sense of how this game is. Game modes are interesting and fun AS LONG AS you are playing as a team and not running around like a lone wolf. Some maps are smaller than the others, but in general map size is ok for this game except for teamdeathmach which is a disaster. 64 players in a relatively small map and a HORRIBLE re-spawn system for TM, but other game modes are ok. Just like other BF titles, Conquest is the heart of the game; however, heist is another fun game mode that most players spend their time playing as well. Blood money game mode is fun IF you have good team mates.

Now that I mentioned the positive aspects of the game, let me cry about some negative aspects.

1- The game doesn't have region lock just like BF3-4. What is region lock you ask? It's simple, that means if I'm in U.S. and I choose U.S. servers only ( East and West regions) I MOST play with U.S. players, but this game allows players from U.K., China, Japan,.. join U.S. servers. This is one of the factors that affect hit detection and lag. Last night I was playing a match of conquest and for some reason I was getting killed by a same guy over and over again, and he was like 50 kills and 3 deaths. I realized other players in my team are also having problem killing the guy; it was like he was a ghost and he was able to do instant kills. After looking at his battlelog profile, I found out he was from China and we were playing in West U.S servers ;-( This could be game breaking few months down the line, just like BF4 and 3

2- The multiplayer customization is very limited. Each class has only 5-6 guns, and usually 2 of them are really bad and nobody really uses them. Cops and Rubbers have ""different"" weapons, but to be honest I didn't feel any difference in performance, they just look different. When you get like 100 kills with a gun, you start unlocking attachments for that particular gun. So you may end up using a same gun for a while. Since I could easily unlock any gun or equipment by using in game money, I feel like I have nothing to unlock after this point on. I'm lvl 36, and I pretty much have everything + 330000$. I hope DLCs bring more weapons to the game.

Overall, I enjoyed the game so far, it's fast-paced; sometimes it feels like a Call Of Duty game. I hope I don't get bored after a month, since I'm already feeling like
"" Why I'm playing the game when there is nothing for me to unlock after this point?"""
122561,3,"As Blu ray player, very good; as an upscaling device, is not as good as the OPPO cheap players; as a console, I stick with the Wii.

351570,3,"(THERE ARE SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW)

I own all of the Metal Gear games and love them and have played them over and over again but this isn't the same, it's not an awful game by any means but, there's no cool boss battles with likable badass bosses, hardly any cutscenes, Ocelot has been reduced to a glorified codec call, Quiet is basically just eye candy for horny guys. Snake doesn't talk and also isn't even snake. You play as Medic the whole game which is lame. Hideo Kojima is amazing but this was by far the worst Metal Gear Solid I've ever played."
334689,3,"This game can be summarized by simply saying it's just ""okay."" I played the original first game back in the day and thought it was moderately entertaining and kept my interest for a bit of time.  Diablo III is merely the same old game spruced up but just hasn't evolved for the modern gamer.  If you like collecting hundreds of useless items for the sake of it and the occassional keeper until it becomes quickly deemed obsolete as you level up, this might keep your interest longer than expected.  You can boil it down to go to a stage with access to other smaller stages, find items, and hit the same few buttons for special powers a million times over.  There is no strategy or technique required.  It's just hit, hit, hit, your enemies and kill them. The game continues to pile on ungodly amounts of demons but once you make it into the lvl 30 area, you can equip special skills that basically make potions useless and you'll stay alive to keep slashing away whether there are five enemies or 100 on the screen at once.  The more that come on the screen at once, the more it just becomes a chore to clear them all out.  You just get too strong at the previously stated levels to be killed and this takes away a lot of the fun first found in the initial few hours of gameplay.  Now you can of course increase difficulty to do just that but it really didn't change my perception of the overall game.

There are some nice elements of the game like the overall look and storyline.  Furthermore, there are different classes of characters but my one and only is approaching lvl 50 and I find little desire to redo the whole thing with a different one.  I will likely just trade the game in for something different very soon when I complete the storyline. It's just okay, a bit boring, and probably won't hold your interest too long.  However, if this game gets into the $30 or less range than it might not be a horrible time killer."
47485,3,"So maybe I'm the wrong person to be doing a review. But they are all basically the same and while Double Dash looks pretty it does little to further the genre.

The graphics are, quite simply, gorgeous. Mario Kart Double Dash shows what the Gamecube is capable of with brilliant colors, wonderful landscapes and vivid race courses. The sound isn't up to much though. Sound effects are kind of generic and the music is hardly a standout.

Pretty much, if racing games are for you then Mario Kart Double Dash is essential if you have a Gamecube. I couldn't care less about this genre so I can gladly never play again, no matter how stunning it looks."
366666,3,It was okay but nothing to get too excited about.
32767,3,"I play this game at the strategic level (i.e., I let the computer fight the tactical battles).  Played this way, the game is the kind I like.  However, the people who produced this game need to put some more thought into managing the armies, navies, keeps, and countries.  Essentially, it's a problem of status changes.  For instance, each country has two build queues (infrastructure and units).  When something from those queues finishes, the game pops up a notice during the End of Year (EOY) processing.  However, those pop-ups are just that:  you accept the message and off the game goes with more EOY stuff (and more messages).  When you finally get around to being able to interact, you have no idea what's done and you have to check every country to figure out if you have a queue to fill.  What the game needs is for you to go to those build queues from the pop-up message and set up the next item (or check that the remainder of the queued items are still what you want to build).  Then the EOY process could continue to the next such message.
By military status changes, I mean when a unit impinges on your viewable space.  For instance, if you've got naval units in a sea and an enemy plops a newly built ship right next to you, the game doesn't let you know.  Ditto for land units.  There are no little colored dots on the mini-map for you to see at a glance either.  You have to manually scroll the main map across the whole of Europe and look for enemy units.  This gets very tedious, very quickly.
For diplomacy, a country can go to war against you, and the first inkling you have of such a status change is that you're suddenly in battles.  Also, there's no easy way to initiate diplomacy with a country.  You have to find the foreign leader on the map (no little dots or anything shows where he is) and drop one of your emissaries on him to start things rolling.  If that leader is in some are that you can't see troops in, then you're SOL.
Also, and this is a pretty big problem, trade via ships is very badly designed.  Trade is mostly transparent.  What you have to do is set up a chain of ships from one port to another (and all spaces in between).  As long as an enemy hasn't sunk a ship (or is just sitting next to one of your ships (in wartime), everything's fine.  But, if that chain gets broken, trade stops.  I'm sorry.  But, trade shouldn't work that way.  It should be set up so that if you control the ports at both ends, then the ships will travel between them.  Maybe they'll be intercepted en-route and sunk.  That's fine.  But, this chain-of-ships thing is silly.
There are other problems, but what they all add up to is an overly tedious game.  With a little more thought, Activision could have had an excellent game here.  However, as is, it's merely ok."

96405,3,"This is worth getting for the extra wiimote, given that it is not that much more in price than getting the wiimote by itself.

But keep in mind that the games that come with it are just so-so.

In my mind, it's barely worth the extra $10 for the game"
126619,3,"Ok, I bought this game after playing the first years ago.  Games have made leaps and bounds since Starcraft, but haven't really gotten that much better in overall fun or playability.  After buying this game and playing through a few levels and online play I think Blizzard did their best to ruin a great game.

Issues:

1. No LAN - Why didn't Blizzard, or more correctly Activision-Blizzard include this in the game?  Well it's a control issue.  They have to find a way to implement control over how you play this game in multiplayer.  On a LAN game there is very little of that - yet, but they'll find a way.  Still not TOO big of a deal.

2. Online Activation - Shouldn't be necessary if you don't play online.  What if I lived in BFE and a friend mailed me the game?  I'd be outta luck.  Not necessary except another way to issue control over the game.

3. Online play only - If you want to continue in a single player campaign you have to be online and logged into BNET (otherwise you have to play on a temporary ""guest"" account no your own cpu!).  Say what!  Absolute crap.  Another way to implement control.

4. Even though it has 30 missions it is still 1/3 of the story.  Are the other 2 parts already done?  Will it be another 12-13 years before we get part 2 or 3?  Will I be playing Starcraft 2.1 with my great-great-grandchildren?  Who knows.

As I said before it gets 3 points simply off having great gameplay like the original, being easy to play, and having a decent storyline.  Overall, it seems like activision-blizzard is trying to force some sort of control over how we play the game (ala WOW) even if we're not playing online with others.  All I can say is please don't go the way of STEAM and other related systems, and if you do, expect the next release to be more like 5-7 million instead of 10-15 million or so."
206202,3,"I am new to the GOW franchise and have heard great things about the games, but was unable to play them until now as my PS3 is not backwards compatible.  First, I would like to say to parents, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18.  The game does contain some nudity and suggestive themes and is very violent.

I was impressed by the game play and graphics.  It was like Devil May Cry meets 300.  The games contain killer combos and a great upgrade system, but there is one thing about the game that bothered me.
I consider myself a fairly good gamer, but there were points in GOW that frustrated me to no end.  Even changing it to easy did not seem to make a difference.  For example, in the Hades level you have to climb up rotating pillars, while blades are rotating around.  Sounds simple enough right?  Wrong, you touch one and you fall all the way down to the bottom and start over.  This is just one of many frustrating obstacles.  With that being said though, for some reason the game compels you to keep trying and eventually get through it no matter how many times you have to try.  I am starting on GOW II now and so far so good.

PROS:
-Great graphics and story.
-Good control.
-Great value.

CONS:
-May be too difficult at times for some gamers. I would definitely recommend this game, but beware if you are just a casual gamer.  The quest will not be easy.  If you like this game you may also like the Devil May Cry series if your PS3 is backwards compatible.

53824,3,"The commercials for this game were very misleading. They make Call of Duty: Finest Hour look so much better than it actually is! However, that's not saying it's a bad game. Once you get past the initial disappointment, it has its high points. Call of Duty is your basic WWII first-person shooter. The graphics are nice and the game is pretty realistic, but not much stands out from other games of this genre.

PROS:

The weapons are realistic, but some people will try to tell you it's too hard to aim, and aiming is so much easier on the PC version because the gun doesn't move around as much. Go try shooting a real gun and tell me how easy it really is to aim and fire a rifle while standing. Sure the gun moves around a lot when you're using the iron sights, but it's supposed too! Another good thing is there's not some tiny little crosshair that will tell you right where you're going to shoot. The huge crosshair in Call of Duty is only to be used in close quarters fighting, and the rest of the time you need to use the guns' iron sights. The guns are accurate, but not TOO accurate, and accuracy is lost the longer you fire.

There's also a nice selection of weapons, from the M1 Garand to Bren Light machine guns. My favorite was the Mosin-Nagant sniping rifle, and the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was great as well. If you run out of ammo, you can always steal a gun from a dead enemy. MP40s are especially useful, because they fire slow enough to remain accurate while still covering a large area with bullets relatively quickly. In the Normal difficulty setting, it takes about the same number of shots to kill an enemy as it takes for them to kill you, and you don't have to empty an entire magazine to take down a single enemy, but it takes enough shots that it doesn't become too easy. And so what if there are no pistols? If you were charging up a hill at a machine gun nest, would you rather have a pistol or a more powerful weapon?

The levels are designed nicely, though they are a little too scripted. If you get killed, you'll always know right where the enemy is going to pop up from when you get back to that spot. The levels are large and detailed, and there are just enough to amke the game interesting without becoming repetitive or boring. There are plenty of ammo and health pick-ups throughout the game. Enemies are everywhere, and there's rarely a quiet moment. The only level that I thought was stupid and pointless was the last one of the British campaign where you have to run through the open under fire from three MG42 positions and countless enemy soldiers, plant explosives right where all the enemies are pouring out of, and then run. This seemed very unrealistic, and would have been impossible in real life, because there's no way to take out the MG42 gunners, for if you snipe one, another immediately takes his place. Luckily, this was the only mission that I didn't like. The levels in this game are taken from some of the less-known battles and locations of WWII, from North Africa to Remagen, with none of battles that are overdone in other WWII games, such as D-Day. I had hoped for a longer battle in Stalingrad, but oh well...

You get to play as the Russians, British, and Americans. Each country has its own weapons and locations to fight in. This gives you views of the war from the perspective of many different people. Unfortunately, there are only four British levels, two of which are very short and simple.

CONS:

Call of Duty: Finest Hour has some of the dumbest AI I've seen in any game, EVER. If anyone tells you the AI is well-done in this game, they're either stupid or a dirty liar, or both. Friendly and enemy AI is terrible!! I parked my tank on a runway at a German-controlled airfield in Russia, and their planes continued to attempt to take off, even though I was shooting every single one of them down, one after the other. When driving in a tank, stupid German infantry will stand out in the open shooting you with their MP40s, which do absolutely nothing. While they're shooting, you can roll your tank right over them, and they don't even make an attempt to get out of the way. Your own Allies in some of the levels are complete idiots who do nothing but run around yelling at you to shoot the enemy, even when they have a more clear shot. They do shoot, but never hit anything and the only thing that they accomplish is giving away your position. On the first American mission, you have to protect an M12 Mobile Gun Carriage, and there are Germans with panzerfausts all over. Your squadmates could be standing two feet from an anti-tank German, and rather than shooting them, they yell at you to protect the M12, so you have to try and kill all the Germans yourself. It took me several tries to get through that mission on EASY mode! On several occasions, I would man a MG42 emplacement, and one of my own men would stand in front of the gun and get shot, and still wouldn't move. They follow you around like Lemmings, doing nothing except getting killed. Say you go through a door with your squadmates following you, and then a grenade is thrown at you. The most obvious course of action would be to run back through the door to safety, but lo and behold, there are morons blocking your path who don't seem to realize they're all in danger. Your allies will blindly walk into enemy fire or onto grenades. But I guess that's all for the best: they weren't doing you any good anyway.

Characters who are necessary to the plot or are needed to make an appearance in a cutscene later in the game are invincible. But do they use that to their advantage? NO! You still have to do all the work. An example of this is Cpl. Benny Church, who always follows Sgt. Chuck Walker (that's you in the U.S. levels). He does nothing but is constantly getting shot, yet is promoted to Sergeant later on. It's pretty funny to watch one of these characters walk towards an MG42 nest, stand there getting pummeled, and then run away without a scratch. And by funny I mean stupid.

One of the unrealistic elements of this game is the tanks. Enemy tanks can be destroyed in one or two shots, but your own tanks are nearly invincible. Tanks have armor and health, and when the armor is depleted, the health will regnerate itself if you continue to get damaged. If I remeber my history correctly, U.S. Sherman tanks were no match for German Panzers and Tigers, yet one Sherman can take on six German tanks at one time, no problem. And what's the deal with the 3rd-person ""chase mode"" while in a tank? The gun won't fire where you aim, and there's no point for it. But I guess I shouldn't complain... if the tanks weren't invincible, I'd never make it through those levels.

There's no way to save in the middle of a mission! The game is saved before and after, and there are checkpoints in between, but you'll often find yourself getting to the end of a level, dying, and then having to restart from the beginning. Checkpoints rarely occur, and they're usually in the most pointless places and never when you really need them.

Some of the action is too scripted, and the missions are pretty linear. Only certain doors can be opened, and there's really only one way to complete your mission. Very little strategy is involved: shoot the Germans, complete your objectives, move on to the next level.

Despite its shortcomings, Call of Duty: Finest Hour is an okay game. However, I'd recommend renting it or waiting until it's on sale to buy it. Playing Call of Duty is a good way to spend a weekend, but it won't leave any lasting impressions, and it will probably be forgotten soon after you finish."
100167,3,"I agree with many other reviewers that this game is neither good nor bad.  It has a nice, open-ended world, which makes the basic plot work rather well.  The problem is that they couldn't have even used half of the space on the disc in the creation of this game.  There is absolutely no customization (even though the plot is so basic, you could pretty much be a floating eye with arms).  With technology as it is, this is inexcusable, these days.  This just shows that the development team thinks that only male characters can be heroes.  Any Fable game is, by far, better than this game.  I haven't tried the sequel (since it's not out yet), but I doubt that will be any better.  If they do increase anything, it will be graphics.  I'm certain the storyline and game play mechanics will still be very basic, and there will still be no customization at all.

Before I get a bunch of people jumping on me about the customization, sure, you can customize in online, multiplayer mode, but I do like to play offline more often than online.  I would have given the game only 1 star if it wasn't for that ability, but it's not enough to make the game any more worthwhile."
437128,3,"Everything included, except the game, are fantastic.  The vinyl sounds great, the prints look good, the dog tags are super realistic, and the art book is great for the coffee table.  The game in the other hand is 8/10 story wrapped up in 5/10 gameplay.

The driving is horrible.  The gunplay is sub par compared to other games like it, Watch Dogs and GTA V for example.  The collectibles are meaningless, not even tied to unlockables, upgrades, or trophies.  Even the ending is messed up with instant try the other ending option."
404154,3,"The remastering is great the whole series looks much better, but the reason I took stars away is because they didn't bring back the mutliplayer like they did with the Last of Us remaster which really disappointed me."
493009,3,The worst souls game.
237886,3,"For the price, (80USD) I don't think it was worth the purchase. Yes I get extra maps and cool coins but thats it. Nothing really changed. They made some improvements to multiplayer but thats it. What do you expect though, it's running the same engine as MW3."
57748,3,"Guild wars isn't exactly a MMORPG but that's ok.  In an original idea, the developers took the common 'chat' rooms that people used to use to find adventuring parties in games like Diablo or Starcraft and turned them into Cities where people can trade, chat and acquire quests.  A new and interesting way of connecting with players around the world.

While it appears to be a MMORPG, this is where it stops.  Once you and your team enter the game world, you share an instance of the game world and are free to traverse the country side and complete mission uninhabited by other players, PVPers or any of the potential negatives of the traditional MMORPG.  Gone are the days of walking through the secluded out of the way location only to see 5 players run by.  This is a very nice touch.

Ironically, my biggest complaint with Guild Wars would be the multiplayer aspect.  In single player, or joint missions with friends the game runs well and you're free to do any skill sets you choose.  A very fun and nice touch, however in PVP it's nearly impossible to get into a team unless you have specific skills which forces teams and classes to feel very commonplace.  I would have liked to seen more flexibility and competition using a variety of skills instead of a few 5-6 per class.  The ability to find new skills and change them out between missions is very nice and it allows you to change the entire makeup of your character to suit given quests.  Another unique and enjoyable idea added in by NCSoft.

All in all this was a very fun game that I enjoyed playing for several months and the fact that it doesn't have a monthly fee really made it easy to purchase.  Jump in and play for a few hours, then log in next week or tomorrow it doesn't matter."
255322,3,"It's a rather simple game, but enjoyable enough if you only pay a couple dollars for it like I did.

It's a bad port that leaves you wondering what to do and what commands to enter.  Some text references xbox controllers and not the equivalent pc commands which can make it hard to play.

Once you get past that, it's fun-ish.  It's also short.  There are only 8 missions.

It's worth a few bucks, but not much more."
232622,3,"This was a very good deal for the price. Two games in one for a reasonable price is hard to pass up. Price value aside, I will say after playing a few minutes of the game I was able to figure out some of the areas that this game succeeds in and fails.  In my opinion the graphics, story, characters, and voice acting is where you'll see the best of the game quality. The graphics are beautiful, the characters feel strong and lively with very good voice acting. Surprisingly the story is pretty decent and provides you with some good moments to keep your interest. This game scores very well in almost every area, except for the battle system. It uses the mix of traditional turn base and free roaming style, but it doesn't offer a good feel of uniqueness to make it stand out. At times it just feels boring or repetitive. The only time the combat  gets somewhat interesting is when your using the White knight. Despite the games flaws I can't say that I was completely disappointed with my purchase. Again there was a lot that I loved about this game to keep me playing it. I just wish there was a lot more to offer with the combat mechanics."
101769,3,"I found the game to be generally well-designed. Settings can be adjusted for right-hand or left-handed play. As reviewer James F. points out, the game allows for both short-term (2-5 min) and long-term play (30~ min). There are several different modes of play including a daily play option. I liked the music but it can get a little repetitive, especially if you are playing for a long haul. However, IIRC, the music is tied into the background you are playing on, and you can change that background before starting a game (on most play modes).

As I recall, blocks of matching types in each set (of all sets) are not only distinct colors but also distinct shapes. This should be useful for those with color-blindness who would otherwise have trouble, say, telling apart the green (circle) block and red (heart) block. Additionally, before beginning play the player can usually choose their preferred set of blocks. Should you be hard of hearing or deaf, playing this game should not be difficult; the most important sound, gameplay-wise, is the one which begins to sound when the blocks are reaching the top of the screen. I don't recall if there is a visual cue which accompanies this or not, but perhaps another reviewer does?

Despite the game's slickness, I found it incredibly dull. Perhaps, as Clement Yang comments to Michael Kerner's review, I'm just bad at the game. I know for a certainty I'm not great at it, and I was never really compelled to become better. I think I may well have gotten more out of the game if I had played multiplayer--the only thing that kept me playing the game as long as I did was to master the few challenges the game cart comes with.

I gave the game to my mom. She loves it."
217741,3,"I've been using this for a year or so now. I got two of them because they were on sale for about $12. Overall it gets the job done but it still leaves a lot to be desired.

Stick sensitivity
The sticks are definitely not the most precise, though depending on the game you may not notice at all. It's most noticeable if you're trying to aim precisely in a game. The games I noticed these the most are Call of Juarez: Gunslinger and Borderlands 2. Trying to make slight adjustments is not easy as you have to tilt the stick decently far in order for it to register any change.

Ergonomic design
I personally believe that the xbox 360 controller and subsequently xbox one controller are the pinnacle of controller design when it comes to games that require navigating in a 3D environment. With this controller, I've found that certain games where I'm using the sticks for a prolonged period of time actually start to make my hands ache, especially if I'm constantly pressing the shoulder buttons. This of course may vary depending on the size of your hands, but I've never really experienced this with a controller before. I experienced this with the two aforementioned games. These aren't the only games that I've used the controllers for, they're just the ones I've noticed problems with.

The buttons and d-pad work fine, and the ability to switch the function of the d-pad and left stick with a button press is extremely useful for certain games. However sometimes when I use R2 or L2 it pinches my finger. It gets caught between the controller and the button. It not painful but it's just something that I'd rather not have happen.

Overall the controller is ok. I got them cheap so I'm not complaining as much, BUT I think that the price of $25.99 is way too high for something with all these problems AND doesn't have vibration. I recently bought another controller called a ""Zhidong N Full Vibration Feedback USB"" for the same price and so far it seems to be much better than the F310. The shape is more comfortable and the sticks read input much better. It also has vibration.

At the price of $15.99 this controller is a decent bargain, but if you want something more comfortable that you plan on using for a long time, I'd say get the Zhidong controller."
290951,3,"The games play style and storyline are simple: collect relics, grow large, beat up the bad guys, and smash everything in sight. Knack grows larger and stronger by absorbing relics scattered throughout the game. There are no set amount of lives so whenever Knack dies he simply respawns at the last check point. There was a lot that I liked about Knack, but there was also a lot that I disliked.

I liked the nice collection of gadgets to build. The gadgets augment Knacks special abilities. To assemble a gadget Knack has to find all the parts, which are located in hidden treasure chests. When Knack opens a chest a random part will pop out. Once all the parts are gathered the gadget assembles and equips itself. There is a gadget called a Secret Detector, which PINGS when Knack is near any secret door. Other gadgets like the Combo Meter add damage to Knacks attacks through consecutive hits, or the Double Battery, which doubles the damage on Knacks super attacks.

Besides gadgets there are also crystal relics sets to acquire. Collecting a full set of crystal relics unleash ancient powers. For example, gathering 15 ruby relics unlocks Vampire Knack. Vampire Knack is stronger, but his health slowly depletes so Knack must kill enemies quickly to restore health. Each crystal relic set has different attributes and the different varieties of Knack are fun to play.

Surprisingly, beating Knack requires a lot of playtime, and its difficulty level is moderate to hard. Once the game is over you can keep all the relics and gadgets and start up a new game. And although I have not yet played it myself, Knack does have a two player co-op mode.

I had a love/hate relationship with the controls. In most platform 3D games the left joystick controls character movement and the right joystick controls camera angle, but not in this game. Using the right joystick causes Knack to quickly dash in any direction. It took some time to adjust to these controls. I ended up using the dash attacks a lot, but the lack of camera control was frustrating.

Now onto the negatives, and there were many frustrating elements hurting this game. The whole point of Knack is that he can grow gigantic by collecting relics, but no matter how large Knack becomes he is always 2 hits from death. For a long time I felt this must be a game glitch. Small Knack gets killed in 2 hits, and gigantic Knack gets killed in 2 hits. I couldn't figure out what the point was of growing large if it doesnt help Knack take a punch.

Another complaint is enemy choice. Knack is created to fight the goblins hordes, but instead spends a lot of time battling birds and bugs. These types of enemies represent poor game design. Knack can smash armored tanks with one hand and throw them at buildings, but that tiny insect might kill him if it gets too close. The birds and bugs could have been transformed into some kind of mechanized goblin creation that fits the storyline.

In my opinion this is Sonys attempt at producing a Nintendo style game. There are times it feels like I could be playing Mario or Zelda, but ultimately this game is not as fun. The bottom line is that I wouldnt have purchased Knack if there were more games in the PS4 library at launch, and I wouldnt recommend paying more then 20-25 dollars for this game. Maybe rent it first. This game is an average game, but probably good for young children."
440493,3,"Amazing quality for the price, my only gripe is that it uses a flat cord reminiscent of a telephone cable, so I don't know how long that cord would last with heavy use.

Edit: Trigger buttons have serious issues."
166045,3,"I think it works. I tried my dual shock controller from my PS2, but it won't pick up on the inputs unless I press really hard. I think it may be my controller because it sometimes gets stuck going in one direction, like up or left. I'm just tired of buying these controllers and adapters for my Mac that just keep kinda being half broken. I got a fight stick instead and it was well worth the money!"
292579,3,"I have never been as frustrated with a game as I was playing Watch Dogs.  The controls often do not respond as they should, the gameplay is entirely too difficult at times, and the plot line often went way over my head.  With all of that being said, I still found myself pouring hours of my time into this game as it does provide an addictive experience that provides fun, good music, and beautiful graphics.

STORY - You play as ex-criminal hacker Aiden Pearce, who lost his niece due to his dangerous line of work.  When he gets a lead on who was responsible for this dark event in his past, he takes the opportunity to seek revenge, despite the disapproval of his sister (the mother of the dead niece).  As Aiden delves into this endeavor, he discovers that taking down those who are responsible is much more difficult than it sounds.  Hacking the city, infiltrating the various criminal groups in Chicago, and becoming friends with unlikely allies all play a role in Aiden's search.

The plot flows well from one mission to the next, but often I found myself unsure why a certain mission was taking place.  All the organizations and people that Aiden was hacking often meshed together, and while I always understood the end goal, some of the areas in between were a bit too convoluted for me.

There are various side missions and subplots to encounter in the game, but to avoid spoilers, I won't really delve into them.  In my opinion, they don't prove to be too exciting, but they do add length and challenge to the game.

GAMEPLAY - This is a third person shooter, while there is the option for limited melee combat.  Driving also plays a large part in the game, as well as stealth and puzzle solving, showing that this isn't purely a shoot-em-up but rather a cocktail of various gaming genres.

Controls are a sticky topic when it comes to this game as there are so many different controls for the different portions of the game.  Combat, traveling, and hacking are what you do the majority of, and these work fairly well.  There is definitely a heavy learning curve when you begin the game in which the game does not hold your hand, but they are intuitive and easy to get used to.  The problem comes up when there is so much for you to interact with that the game thinks you are trying to hack or shoot one object, when in fact you were trying to hack/shoot another.  Various guns are available to be unlocked, ranging from pistols to rifles.  I never found ammo to be a problem, as it's conveniently located nearly everywhere.  You can craft items such as grenades and blackouts to help, as well.

Driving is where the controls truly become equivalent to vomit.  Controlling any car is the challenge in itself, as cars slip and slide all over the place as if the street is a waterslide and the tires have no traction.  It's even more of a struggle when you are engaged in a high speed chase with the police or some other such foe.  In addition to the control being off, driving could not get any more unrealistic.  Your car can crash into trees, light poles, cliffs, other cars, people, buildings, etc., and it won't even come close to stopping.  It might get dented a bit, but it takes an act of God (or a erupting steam pipe from the ground) to stop your car in its tracks.  Logic and realism definitely takes a far back seat in the driving portion of the game, which is fine since it's virtual reality but a bit confusing since the game is otherwise pushing a very realistic experience.  There are many cars available to unlock from sports cars to trucks to ambulances.

Puzzle solving proves to be a mental challenge in this game, and I love it.  Whether you're hacking a system or going from exploring a location via cameras in order to unlock a door, the puzzles prove to be stimulating and just the perfect mix of challenge and solvability.

Among all of these forms of gameplay there is an autosave feature that saves your gamee automatically after most of the major fights/events.  Unfortunately, the game often doesn't save often enough, and you'll have to start your mission all the way over from the beginning, which can be a frustration once you've almost reached the end of it.  I would have preferred more checkpoints at which the game saved, which would have greatly reduced frustration on my end.

The difficulty of the game on top of everything else was extreme.  You're often asked to take down hordes of 20-30 enemies at a time, and you often have to protect someone at the same time or escape unseen in the end.  I found myself spending at least 30 minutes on many missions, because they were just so difficult and required the perfect touch to complete.  It would have been nice to have had difficulty options, where you could choose a beginner or intermediate option in addition to the advanced gameplay.

Loading screens are often and can take quite a bit of time to load.  I wish they would have either been nonexistent or at least taken just a few seconds to transition from scene to scene.

You have a cell phone interface in which you can track your progress, see statistics about your gameplay, request car deliveries, and much more.  Your skill tree is located here, which is an area in which you can use skill points that you earn throughout the game to unlock abilities and perks.  These really shape your gameplay style and allow you to grow Aiden in a way.

Despite all of my complaints about the game, the gameplay is incredibly innovative and allows for somewhat of an open world experience.  The game's main plot is linear, but you could explore Chicago and never deal with it if you preferred.  The game does take up just as much space as a game such as Skyrim, and I think that is a little much, especially considering the game comes with a specific installation disc, but it is what it is, and you'll have to have the space in order to play the game.

GRAPHICS/SOUND - This is where the game really gets good.  I could gush about the music probably for hours.  The beats that the creators chose match up perfectly with the scenes they are a part of.  There are even some well known songs thrown in for good measure such as Day 'N' Night.  I love the music and will probably end up buying the soundtrack eventually.

The voice acting is good.  I've heard much better, but I've also heard much worse.  Lip sync is great.  Background noise is spot on, whether it be gunshots, car horns, or people talking.

Graphics were fantastic, especially when it came to the cutscenes.  Cutscenes were equivalent to watching a movie.  Gameplay graphics were pretty darn good, as well, though there are other current 360 games that heavily rival it.

WARNINGS - This game pretty much has every warning attached to it.  There is mass amounts of heavy languages with hundreds of uses of the F bomb.  Nudity is present as is sex trafficking.  Drugs and alcohol are consumed, and if you haven't guessed already, there is a lot of violence.  I didn't find there to be much blood apart from a minute amount present at headshots and whatnot.

OVERALL - This is a decent game that is probably going to be worth your time if you're a fan of shooters at all.  Even if you aren't a usual shooter gamer, this game might appeal to you, although you're going to have a major learning curve.  The problems with game are many, in my opinion, and while other games should probably take priority on your gaming list, you might want to put this on your radar."

71592,3,It's just like any other game that's based off a movie. It's okay but never great. Would not recommend to anyone.
57427,3,"I haven't played the first 2 installments, but I got this one for it rating and reviews.

I'm a bit disappointed. I didn't buy DMC 1 & 2 because of reputed camera angle problems. The first two must have really sucked, as camera is one thing I hate the most about this game. The manual actually says ""There will be times in the game where you can't control the camera angle"". It should say ""Once in a while you'll be able to move the camera slightly to the side, not enough to make a difference.""

Graphics are very good, so is the music. Some boss fights have an element of puzzle, which is good. But The whole camera thing ruins it for me almost completely. Definatelyb rent it first or get it when it's cheaper.

This one's going up for auction."

54322,3,"The quick summary of Symphonia is that you'll play the role of Lloyd Irving, a teenaged boy with a cloudy past, who stumbles (along with several friends, naturally) into the adventure of a lifetime, culminating in the rescue of not one, but two endangered worlds. It seems that Lloyd's lifelong friend, Colette, is at the center of a once-every-generation pilgrimage that leads to the mysterious salvation of the world, and that everyone but Lloyd realizes that this journey will not end well for Colette. Basically, it's the plot of Final Fantasy X with more of a homogenized, Saturday morning cartoon flair, and less hideous flying monsters named ""Sin."" I had a really hard time enjoying the progression of the story, as not only was the writing a bit suspect and the characters largely unlikable, but the pacing was jerky and off-putting. After a handful of hours of treading water and building toward an ongoing climax, just as things would begin to get interesting, the story would slam on the brakes and go right back to treading water again. If the writing was feeling particularly exotic, maybe you'd gain or lose a party member in the process.

Perhaps most accountable for the slow death of the story was the inclusion of far, far too much unnecessary dialog, without any sort of payoff to validate its existence. This is a game that would have benefitted tremendously had it been basically halved in length. The plot isn't without its intricacies and shining moments, but they're so few and far between that they lose a lot of their impact amid the tedious, back and forth discussions and repeatedly dull, fetch-and-return styled missions. Conversations almost always go on well beyond the point of good reason, even in key situations. It's understandable to have a silly, one-sided conversation with an unimportant character on the outskirts of a city somewhere... such dialog is the bread and butter of RPGs as a whole. Where such meanderings are less acceptable and more damaging, however, are in the key scenes after crucial battles or big plot twists.

About two thirds of the conversations in Symphonia are delivered via written text, while the more important chats are spoken by a cast of voice actors... it's a fairly good way to indicate to the player that they need to pay special attention to what's going on, because what's being discussed is going to affect the way the game plays out from that point forward. Yet even these spoken scenes are usually marred by poor writing and unnecessary asides that only serve to elongate the experience. I spent fifty two hours shoveling through about twenty hours' worth of really interesting material.

Assuming you can look past the majority of the story, however, the actual practice of playing the game is an extremely enjoyable ride, with plenty of innovation to go alongside the more universally applied elements. All fights occur in real-time, and more resemble a limited Final Fight-style beat-em-up than a standard, turn-based RPG. You're limited to four party members in the field at one time, and will be routinely facing off with as many as six enemies at once. At first glance, the system looks to be nothing more than button mashing and a little luck, but as you become more familiar with your special attacks, working in conjunction with your teammates and shifting your strategy to fit each battle, the actual depth and flexibility of the system becomes much more evident. To tell the truth, I was far from a fan of this battle system until roughly the ten hour mark, when that tiny switch flicked in the back of my brain and I finally understood the intricacies of a fight in the world of Symphonia. The in-game instructions aren't exactly helpful in explaining the full potential of its own mechanics, which leaves you to sort things out on your own... and actually, I preferred it that way. It's much more rewarding when you develop a particularly successful strategy and apply it than it would have been, had you merely followed instructions and begun to paint by number.

The controller setup works well with the way the battle system functions, and never gets in the way, even when things are at their most frenzied. Successfully using the GameCube's controller is usually just a matter of how effectively the ""A"" button is mapped, since it's basically the sole point of focus on the hardware, with every other button and even the analog stick playing a secondary role. Fortunately, Symphonia handles the button in question admirably. In a battle, it's your driving force, working in conjunction with the direction you happen to be pressing on the analog stick to begin one of your basic attacks. While enduring one of the game's lengthy speaking segments, it both increases the speed at which the text appears and acknowledges that you've finished reading that passage and are now physically and emotionally prepared to enjoy the next sentence fragment. It's the only button you absolutely, positively have to have. The rest of the buttons are laid out, basically, declining in button size as they also decline in order of importance. The ""B"" button activates both your special attacks and your magic, depending on the type of character you're controlling. The ""Y"" button brings up whichever menu is appropriate at the moment, the trigger buttons momentarily pause the action while you choose a primary target, and the tiny ""Z"" button initiates incidental conversations at seemingly random points around the map. Because if there's one thing this game needed, it was more incidental conversation.

One area in which the controls run into a snag is in the world map, where roaming around the land can quickly become a headache-inducing experience. The camera angles chosen for this view are typically an overhead perspective, following the player from behind and perhaps zoomed in just a little bit too close for comfort. Should the camera nudge anything above ground level, such as a cliff or small building, however, it'll shift to a godawful view, directly over your party. It'll also kindly zoom in beyond the point of any comprehension, so that you're basically seeing your lead character's scalp and a few feet in either direction around him. Naturally, this makes navigating the map extremely difficult, and usually requires some maneuvering to get back into something resembling a workable view. Inside dungeons and during battle, no such issues are evident.

The visuals are one area in which this title really excels. Although most characters are rendered via cel shading, which is a technique I'm starting to see overused more and more, they never look forced or unnatural. Set against the beautiful, painterly appearance of the entirety of the game's backdrops and surrounding textures, the shading gives the impression of a big budget, animated motion picture. It's a truly lovely combination, and gives the title a style and look all its own. The character designs are provided by Kosuke Fukishima, well known for his work with the ""Oh My Goddess!"" and ""You're Under Arrest"" animated series, and is truly a shining point for the title. The world is filled with a unique visual flair, which is both represented and enhanced by the characters' appearances and their choice in clothing (aside from Lloyd, who wears a jacket that he may as well have lifted from Vash the Stampede himself). The enemies are universally outstanding, and rarely fall to the RPG trend of merely recoloring a design and unleashing it as an entirely different villain. My only real complaint lies with the notable lack of cutscenes during dramatic moments, and that's more a personal preference than anything else. From start to finish, there are three animated cutscenes in this title, and none run for longer than a minute and a half. That makes the giant shot of just such a scene right on the back of the case a bit misleading, and there were surely some moments that would have benefitted tremendously from a little additional visual flair. Instead, 99% of the game is live-rendered, and while this is an example of one of the GameCube's better looking titles, I really would've preferred to see a little bit more than cel shaded polygons after a big fight from time to time.

The audio has its ups and its downs, honestly. Some of the voice acting is really top notch, such as the brooding, secretive speech of Kratos and the unintentionally snooty tone of Raine, but for every character with a quality voice, there exist two or three that are absolutely wretched. Most of the summon monsters have irritating voices, and the leading duo of Lloyd and Colette are so super-nice and cheery, I want to take after them with a rusty butcher knife and a bag of salt. The music, as well, goes beyond the point of no return with the inspiration gathered from colorful nature of the graphics, and is almost entirely forgettable. If I weren't such a stickler for listening to every last moment of spoken dialog in a game, I'd have more than likely played this from start to finish with the television muted and my iPod providing the audio input.

Simply, if you're a GameCube owner and you're jonesin' for an RPG, this will fill your need adequately. The battle system is outstanding, if you've got the patience to figure it out via trial and error, and the visuals are worth a look or two, because they use the Cube's hardware fairly well. If you're also the owner of a PS2 and / or an Xbox, I've got to say there are far better titles out there in the genre. The story stinks, the characters need some serious work, and there is a LOT. OF. NEEDLESS. CONVERSATION. I'd call the entire package above average, but it's not really anything I'm going to recommend my friends go out of their way to try out."

448682,3,"this is a very unorigional and cheap game. the graphics look like that of the master system.the controls are very wierd, because yor character has to slow to a stop rather than just stopping when you let go of the joypad. what's with the character names in this game?

31230,3,"This game never had the feel of a bond game. I walked around and did the simple tasks it gives you and it was over. Even if this was just a random shooter I wouldn't like it, but since it's elegidly a bond game that makes it worse. What about the new kids who are into games who never have even experienced a good bond game? they are being left out of something very cool and so am I. Its pisses me off. EA makes a great madden game, but truely sucks at bond. when they bought the rights to the bond games those games were doomed. What are they thinking? The driving levels in this are short and sorry. sure their nice for a little change, but at least make them enjoyable. no skill+no length+no depth=no fun. Boooo! this game goes to the trash."
256919,3,"I have only had this game for a little over 24 hours but I can say without a doubt that the developers have hit a homerun. It is so frustrating being a rugby fan in the United States because the availability for titles like this one are so limited. I finally got my hands on this game and it did not disappoint. The gameplay is fantastic, I love the trailing camera where it feels like you are in the line. I really think it is a huge imporvement over the old fashioned sideline camera. All the great teams are in it; the only teams and country that are not licensed is South Africa and their Super Rugby teams. As a southern hemisphere fan this should be the only title you pick up because on the other rugby game you can not play as the real All Black or Wallabies. The only problem I have with the game and why I gave it 4 stars is the passing can be glitchy at times. It seems like sometimes I need to push the pass button more than required.
UPDATE: I found many more flaws with this game. The game play is simply not very realistic in regards to real rugby. I also find the career mode to be terribly boring after one season; you are given no opportunities to act like a true coach and add players, make plays etc."
117995,3,"I've been playing WoW since the beginning, and so it pains me to have to say that I feel this expansion either isn't finished, or that Bliz has gotten sloppy.

What's wrong:

1. They've created massive buildings in many of the towns, and if you go upstairs or look around, there's literally nothing in half of them.  They're totally empty.  No chairs, no couches, no fires, no nothing.  Floors, walls, and stairs, that's it.  It makes the world feel so much less alive.  In one town in particular they made huge buildings, and it's like they forgot to put things in them.  I sent upstairs in one and there was literally about four giant floors to this building and outside of the first floor there was nothing on any of the other floors.  Not an NPC, not a chair, not a fire, not a picture.  Nothing.

2. In Burning Crusade I was changing out lvl 60 purples for new lvl 61 greens.  Meaning, my rare gear was being made worthless by common items at lvl 61.  That bugged me, but what bugs me more is that from level 70 to level 79 I had only replaced 2 pieces of my level 70 epic items.  They went from one extreme to the next, and going through a long leveling process without the fun of upgrading gear made the game a lot less fun for me.  I hit level 80 and upgraded all of my gear with auction house rare items, and finally got that upgrade, but it was pretty much one big upgrade, and not a process.  Again, not fun.  Next time, hopefully the split the difference between BC and LK.

3. No recipes to search for and buy in the world.  It seems they did away with having rare recipes be given by various NPC's in the environment.  Everything is trainable now, and the reasons for checking all of the NPC's are gone.  If you need to sell something or get a repair, it's your only reason to talk to an NPC merchant.  This relates again to point one, the world feels dead.  Those little hidden items that only certain merchants would sell added something to the game that made it seem a bit more alive and interesting.  No longer could I go into a town excited to see what I might find for sale there, because there's nothing to find of interest anymore.

So those may seem like minor gripes to some, but it made the entire leveling process, which is long, a boring chore."
473902,3,"i bought the wrong remote, i thought it was for the 360. oh well its my own fault for not reeading the title."
453626,3,"There is nothing special about this product, unless you count the fact that the picture shows an OEM Nintendo controller, but what you get is a Chinese knockoff! Very misleading on the part of Pioneer Marketing! I will not be buying from them again! Overall, this controller is mediocre at best! Not recommended if you like to buy OEM products only. [OEM = Original Nintendo products]"
36732,3,"Bought this package a couple of weeks ago. I have spent a fair number of hours playing. It is certianly entertaining, but I disagree with those that praise this game as real-life simulation. I won't get into the many reasons why this is not the case (and I would never expect it to be), but perhaps the most important item missing is, it is really hard to be a bad person in this game. Everyone is supposed to behave and in fact behaves as a picket-fence, green-yard, nice neighbor.

To me, the biggest letdown of this game is that I developed the exact same feeling I endd up with when I played the multiple SimCity editions: After a bit of playing and putting everyone on the road to success, I find myself wondering ""Ok now what."" It feels a bit pointless to take 10,000 baths, urinate 50,000 times, and watch TV 15,000 times, just as in Simcity it was boring to watch your city live its own life after you were done populating the map and everything was thriving (a matter of time)."
188503,3,"I desperately wanted to love RUSE and for the first two hours I did. You begin the game as an (initially) interesting  US Army Major of the 1st Armored Division in the infamous Kasserine Pass. At your command are historical units engaged in deliberately paced and tactically based action all presented in an attractive and zoom-able tabletop environment. What's not to love?

Unfortunately as the Single Player Campaign progresses the game's mechanics begin to breakdown. RUSE is a game that wants you to look at the ""big picture"" but ends up forcing you to micromanage on the ground. The combat revolves around the tried and true ""rock, paper, scissors"" concept. Here this translates as tank units kill infantry units who kill anti-tank units who then kill tank units. This is then reapplied to air units. Pretty simple right? Well not entirely.

RUSE is many enjoyable things but a historically accurate or realistic war game it is most defiantly not. Many of your units, which were historically very versatile platforms, are represented in this game as part time assets that must be babysat so as not to turn into total liabilities. It's very shocking the first time you see armored, self propelled anti-tank units with 88mm cannons and 7.92mm machine guns retreating from Infantry advancing across open terrain because they're ""rock"" to the infantry's ""paper"". This creates an environment where the tactical level becomes a burden which must be borne instead of a fun challenge to overcome. The player will also note with frustration that the developers have thrown any and all semblance of historical accuracy out the window at the strategic level as well. Being presented with a situation where you're asked to take part in a counter offensive after the Battle of the Bulge where the Germans have dominating air superiority would be amusing if said level where not so infuriating.

Not to say the tactical level is not without its pleasures. The designers made excellent use of line of sight concepts (despite the ability to shoot through forests which is simply bizarre) and the ambush. The first time I saw a light tank from an advance element sprinting down the cobblestone street of a small Italian town and then the whoosh of my waiting infantry's bazooka and the resulting fireball I had an ear to ear grin of pleasure. This combined with the emphasis placed on recon units allows the true use of enfilade, L-shaped ambushes and some other realistic tactics. Unfortunately, again, as the game progresses you are forced to fumble with poorly grouped and managed units at the strategic level which simply doesn't allow for the implementation of much of the careful attention required to do these things.

While I'd like to be able to say that the Campaign is, by far and away, the worst portion of RUSE the truth is that it has some very stiff competition from the poorly constructed, stand alone ""what if"" scenarios available. Some are embarrassingly easy, others incomprehensibly hard but none of them are actually fun.

The one aspect of RUSE that does translate well is the multi-player. Because your opponent doesn't have the ability to simply spam you with units like the computer does the tactical aspect becomes fun again and the strategic level becomes as important as it should actually be. The ""RUSE ability"", which is a collection of psychological actions, fakes, feints, espionage and counter-espionage tactics, actually has a use against a human opponent whereas they are often left either forgotten or unpleasantly forced into use in a linear fashion during the campaign.

The bottom line is that RUSE is not a realistic war or historical strategy game. It's simply an RTS set in World War II which is usually frustrating but occasionally brilliant. The bulk of the enjoyment the player will get out of the game is in playing other people so I'd recommend a rental to WWII and RTS enthusiast so they can try out the multi-player and before they sink the retail price into the game.

Pros:
*Looks great with very smooth camera action.
*Terrain details and map lavished with attention.
*When ambushes and complex plans work the game comes to life.
*Tactical mechanics conductive to multi-player.
*A wide variety of units and factions which play slightly different.
*Real time saves/loads.

Subjective qualities:
*A deliberate, even slow, pace of game play.
*Game play forces player to play on both tactical and strategic levels.
* Campaign missions ""unfold"" with progressive goals.

Cons:
*Silly unit attributes and abilities.
*Tedious micromanagement which robs the strategic level of any fun.
*A sub par AI which spams the player with units.
*Really poor level design.
*Some missions are frustrating in their difficulty.
*Obvious, eye roll inducing, storyline."
265226,3,"I played this ND game after having played ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" (#4) through ""The Phantom of Venice"" (#18) in order and thought it was a great way to get back to the beginning. However, what I found were a lot of fun gimmicks alluding to the other ND games without much substance to the first game. I think I finished the whole game in about 2 hours. That being said, it's not like I didn't enjoy those 2 hours :).

I give it a 3/5 because it's easy, a bit repetitive, but still fun."
273795,3,"When it comes to the television show Family Guy, some of the best episodes out there are the ones in which Brian and Stewie travel together and actually don't feature the rest of the cast. One of the better episodes was an episode in which Brian and Stewie traveled through the Multiverse. Apparently the creators know how popular the episode is because they made a video game that was a sequel to it. Back to Multiverse can be considered fan service in just about every respect. If you really love the show and its humor you'll really love this game to a certain extent. And while it's packed full of references it's hard to say this is a game worth forking over sixty dollars for. If anything it would've easily sufficed as a downloadable game on PSN or XBOX Live Arcade. There isn't really enough content to justify the price tag (though it's sure to go down eventually).

Back to the Multiverse begins in typical Family Guy fashion. It's as though you're playing through an actual episode of the show. It plays the opening of the show--credits and all--as though this really is going to be a typical episode. It then shows Brian and Stewie. Their banter is quickly interrupted when Bertrum shows up from a different universe. He wants revenge on Stewie and is about the travel the multiverse to amass an army. It's up to Stewie and Brian to stop him by following him through the multiverse. As far as Family Guy goes, the actual synopsis for this episode is definitely pretty cool. And it's got some great humor in many respects. The cutscenes themselves are full of some nice witty banter between Brian and Stewie but once you get into the actual game only your fan devotion is likely to hold you. And you'll need to be a die hard fan of the show for it more so than just someone who watches it every now and then.

There are ten levels in Back to the Multiverse. Each complete with objectives. You'll never get lost as there is a marker that will always show you where to go and where you should be. Each level seems to have its own theme. There's one level where it's all filled with Amish. Another where everyone is crippled and you must battle through their fortress and a few more surprises I won't spoil. Although there isn't much to spoil. Any die-hard fan of the show will have seen this all before. You don't get the sense there was much created from scratch for the game.

You'll play as Brian and Stewie and be able to switch between them on the fly. Each of them have their own set of weapons at their disposal. Stewie has his trademark ray guns and inventions while Brian has the standard stuff like pistols, shotguns and rifles. Characters also have secondary weapons and items they can use. You can throw diaper bombs with Stewie or molotov cocktails with Brian. It seems like there is a lot of variety but Back to Multiverse puts an emphasis on shooting your way through. And hordes of enemies will come at you from everywhere. The difficulty spikes seem a little unbalanced. One minute everything seems manageable, the next you're overrun and barely able to survive. It's okay though, because a lot of health packs and ammo are plentiful throughout each level. There isn't really too much variety in the objectives, though. Many times it's usually finding something to open passage so you can move forward, or it's something along the lines of killing a certain enemy to move on.

As you kill enemies you'll also collect cash. You'll be able to use this to buy more weapons and costumes, as well as increase your health or the amount of ammo you can carry.

Every level is filled with references to the show. But this is actually part of the problem. You'll find characters in levels and hear your enemies and people close by spouting off their lines. The thing is... you've heard nearly all of it before. Many of the lines are lifted directly from the show. Every now and then there is something original but for the most part, if you're that familiar with the show you've heard all these lines before. This brings about another small issue with the game in and of itself... you will hear them constantly. These lines pop up again and again. In the very first level you'll constantly hear a frat boy saying, ""I'm angry, but not because I'm gay."" It gets old really fast. Whenever Stewie picks up ammo he'll say the ""This is my rifle/this is my gun..."" line from the episode where he and Brian went into the army. It's constant, though and after a while it's just annoying. At first you'll probably enjoy this. Then again, with so many lines throughout the entire history of the show you're apt to wonder why they didn't lift a bigger variety of them.

The biggest drawback is that the game is relatively short with little replay value. The game can easily be completed in 3 to 5 hours. It's brief, just like an episode of the show. And while some of it is funny and witty, it's really only the cutscenes that are really that fun or engaging to watch.

At the very least fans of the show will be happy to know that the writers and voice actors did step up to the plate to help out with the story and characters. The cast is here to deliver their lines and it's done rather well. The graphical presentation is a little jarring at first. It's cartoon like, which is a good thing. On the other hand, some animations seem a little stilted. Mostly the cutscenes and the lip movements from time to time. Likewise, the game being in 3D makes certain aspects look just a tad... strange. Such as looking at Stewie's hair or Brian up close. Nevertheless those are small nitpicks. There are also moments in which you might feel the game could use a couple more details. A lot of environments strangely feel scarce or empty. I like that it looks like the cartoon, but you sometimes get the sense that they could've done a little more.

Back to the Multiverse isn't a bad game at all. It is a little steep to pay the full sixty dollar price tag for a game that's this short and doesn't offer nearly as much replay value. There are a few extra things to do outside of the main story, but it's really nothing special. It's a great amount of fan service at least and if you're a die hard fan you may like it. Otherwise you may want to wait for just a little bit."
114353,3,"This is by far not a super high quality Joystick but it was worth every penny that I paid for it, which wasn't much.  It works with all of the simulator games that I play and has a lot of configurable buttons."
460881,3,"Pros:
- Collection of swords and therefore sword techniques creates potential for fun.
- Old Western grainy film mode is a nice touch.
- Telephoto shots used in cutscenes is classic of Westerns.
- Fun to hack and slash as quickly as possible when your Master Gauge is full- reminds me of Tate in Shinobi.

Cons:
- Very repetitive gameplay
- Very repetitive characters and horribly repetitive character dialog
- AIs respawn at the same location
- AIs are pretty stupid- shooting at their Boss as well
- You have to fight the camera and the AIs at the same time.
- Heel chafes.

This game really had potential for some offbeat comedic elements and some unique gameplay, however its repetitiveness shows that the game designers couldn't come up with anything clever beyond the initial concept. Giving players new swords and capabilities is good but to have to get them through long drawn-out, repetitive fights is not worth the effort. At one point I got so tired of fighting, I just stood in a part of a room where the enemy couldn't reach me and would repeatedly try to shoot or lob explosives at me, only to miss and hit their boss.
After waiting for this to go on for about 15-20 minutes the boss will die. One could kill the boss of course but the rewards and risks aren't worth the trouble.

Pick it up only when it hits the bargain bin and if you are a huge fan of samurai-based hack and slash games, otherwise rent it."

104261,3,"Well, what would you do if you owned one of the hottest, most commercially successful gaming properties of the day? Wouldn't you, too, release a new game every year? This is more of the same AC just packaged in a different vibe. Personally, I was far more interested in the roman and medieval vibe of previous games. Now in America, I am less interested, because it's no longer something exotic. It's America! I know too much about this world to be very interested in traipsing about and tracking down the gents who look at me every day on my currency. Let's see if the Pirate thing is gonna be any good when it's released but I'm keeping my hopes low. If you haven't already played previous games, I'd say the best of the bunch is AC II."

252901,3,"Ok so the gaming companies have decided that Zombies are the main bad guys now a days. That is getting sort of boring with zombies in all these games, seriously can't they come up with something better?
This is one of those games also that would be better to play on console, since all the controls are right in your hands.
With a game of this type, the controls are all over the keyboard and depending on your mouse it might not work to well with the quick access wheel feature.

They give you all these powers but most times you just use one or two.
While you can use then more one at time, switching to another power takes a couple seconds to select and activate which you can't do in a fight.
you also can't just use your powers all out, since you have a limited amount and one way to recharge your mana. While it will recharge after using your power if you wait a few seconds, but in fight you can run out a couple moves.

Fighting is interesting if not frustrating sometimes.
Your enemies all have been trained by, Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee, and Jackie Chan. Because they can do some freaky moves.
For example you swing your sword, they move their whole upper body to the left so you miss, at the same time shooting their gun and landing a kick to your gut. So their bodies are pointed in three different directions of 90 degrees.
They also have a nice trick of slowing drawing their gun and slowly taking aim at you, which seems to make them impossible to hit with your sword even though they aren't moving.

oh and if you knock out all the guards, you can pick them up to hide their bodies, throw them around like rag dolls, jump up and down on their heads, but if one guard sounds the alarm they all wake up and attack you.

The story is sort of boring also, you can usually see what is going to happen with no big suprises.

So it's sort of a boring game, one to play only to kill some time.

If you think about the game and the first thing that comes to mind is the negative, then it's not really a good game."
249329,3,"At first glance Paper Mario Sticker Star looks like your average Paper Mario RPG game, but appearances can be misleading. They kept the cartoonesque feel and clever jokes of the franchise but it's noticeable early on that Nintendo tried a different approach this time around. There is significantly less of an RPG feeling in Sticker Star. You still battle and the idea remains the same, but it's not an open world anymore. Instead you have worlds with levels like Super Mario Bros and you beat one to get to the next. It's done rather well in that sense and for the most part they have the Paper Mario feeling. However, what made Paper Mario games so great to me was how you roamed freely with no levels which was different for a Mario. Now we're back to levels which is a step backward if you ask me. The levels work and they are fun but l can't help but think they messed with a successful formula.

The presentation aspect is fantastic, Paper Mario on the 3DS looks amazing and it looks right at home. The 3D works very well mixed the 2D graphics for a unique presentation. The way the characters talk, move and interact is just charming and perfect. The paper, pop-up look definitely translates nicely on the 3DS.

The story goes like follow. Bowser steals a royal sticker and gives pieces of it to his people which gives them superpowers. A shiny crown follows Mario who has to go find the stickers and save princess Peach, of course. The crown helps you along the way with it's powers and serves Mario like Link's Navi does. I found the story to be lacking but wasn't overly preoccupied by it. So now you go around with a binder that stores stickers you find and use these stickers to battle. Pretty simple, different and it works well. Sometimes you'll collect real life items like scissors that you can turn into a sticker. Those special items stickers are much bigger and powerful than the average sticker (and take up more places).

The battles are a crucial point when it comes to discussing this game. Now you use stickers you collect to fight enemies. You'll use a jump sticker if you want to stomp a goomba for instance. Some of them have very clever and fun cut scenes and l thought there were some good ideas like the Fireball sticker turns you into Fireball Mario for an attack. The fight system may seem odd or unappealing on paper but translates well on the screen. Personally l thought there is nothing wrong with the new fight system. The problem l do have is that the battles are essentially useless to the point that if you can avoid them you should. That's the main downside to an otherwise good game. The EX points and stats are completely gone so there's no reason to fight unless its a cute scene or a boss or to get rid of some of the less useful stickers you possess. At least stats would have been useful to indicate how strong the stickers are but you have to remember them on your own.

The game is clever in that its tricky and not necessarily easy to figure things out. It demands more from the gamer than the average Mario game which Paper Mario has always been known for. The boss battles are that way as well, seeing as you have to have an idea what stickers to use and when to use the special item stickers you collect.

I miss going around freely, you wanted to talk to characters in previous games, the EX points and stats plus the side quests were always fun adventures. All of that is gone. Basically they took a game that was in a free roaming RPG style based and put a bunch of restrictions that didn't enhance or improve the product in any way whatsoever. Having a sidekick was nice as well, now that's gone and you have the shiny crown to talk to.

Overall, Paper Mario Sticker Star is not a bad game at all. It retains the uniqueness of Paper Mario, looks and feels very nice on the 3DS but due to the lack of more traditional RPG elements the hardcore Paper Mario fan will be left with a bad taste in their mouth. My Mario RPG cravings weren't totally satisfied as a fan of the three previous entries. I feel with this game Nintendo tried to appeal more to the younger and casual audiences. There's a lot of fun to be had and it's enjoyable but l expected a little more and it didn't totally deliver. I still think this shows that a true RPG Paper Mario game like Thousand Year Door could be portable and work on the 3DS 3.5 stars"

pros

1-the premium vehicles are beatifull and detailed.
2-the tracks and game modes are cool.
3-the playvility if terrific, if a very adicted game.

cons
1-the standart cars are exactly the opposite side of premium, ugly and undetailed, this part stinks.

and this is all the cons the game overall is very beatyfull  but this little things make me angry, six years, is too much, but indeed the best car racing game in all plataform.

291548,3,"One might be seduced by the gorgeous graphics or the space setting, but make no bones about it, this game lacks the sophistication that modern games should really employ at this point. Sure if you are under 20, this might be a really fun space romp of shooting and shiny things, but there is no subtlety in the telling of this story. Characters are caricatures invented to illicit emotional resonse, but because we can't relate to them, there is no emotional response. Death after death and I felt nothing. Call me cold, but I literally cried during the first 10 minutes of the Last of Us.

Will you enjoy this game? Maybe. If you care about visuals more than story - yes. This thing looks and plays wonderfully. The only places where the gameplay breaks down completely is is areas where you are in zero-g or flying. For some inexplicable reason Guerilla games reversed the stick controls for just those sections and I had to manually switch them to ""reverse"" in order to not crash into things.

I've played every Killzone and I'm afraid this is my last. Why I have given Guerilla so much credit in the past is beyond me, but there are better games that are worth playing. Unfortunately I'm not sure Guerilla Games is capable of making a game that feels honest. This is a great game to show off the power of your PS4, but nothing else."

379700,3,"Pros:
1. Handsome looking
2. Integrates well with some apps like and skyping is very fun with it
3. Good camera resolution

Cons:
1. Poor voice recognition, It won't understand your voice if you don't speak with an american twang IMO.
2. Very Very few worthwhile games and apps.
3. The fact that its always on as long as the Xbox is and is constantly watching you and hearing you is quite creepy.
4. Doesn't do enough unless you also ruyn your TV through Xbox (which I dont)
5. Doesn't come with a TV mount.

Summary:A brilliant product... If it did what it is supposed to do. It looks good, works well (when it does) and is useful in some ways but it is severely hampered by lack of games and semi functional voice recognition. Also mounting and privacy screens are an additional cost if you want them.

Suggestion: Only for hardcore fans of augmented reality games and for kids who cant dance or go skiing or play any other sports outside their own home.

For regular Xbox users : SKIP IT!"
436859,3,"I've almost had this controller for a year and it is now showing it's age. The right trigger button is sticking so on weapon games, the guns continue to shoot (in full auto) until the button releases. RIP ammo count. It doesn't rumble anymore. I don't remember when that part failed. Currently the official XBOX controller is the same price as this one so I'd go with that one. I have that controller and it is still going strong for almost 3 years old."
27544,3,"I have read some reviews, and I must say, I agree that this is a great game. You can pretty much go anywhere, it is challenging, the graphics are great, and pretty much everything anyone else has said.......BUT, I must also say that this is an extremely violent game. I don't know that there is a need for that kind of violence, and there is something wrong with killing innocent people and not getting punished for it. This is not appropriate for teens or children, not at all. Morals aside, it is great and a lot of fun....hmmmm....what does that say about me?  Really though, the game is put together well, and you can actually try to avoid killing pedestrians and innocent people, but sooner or later it will happen. You will also be pitted against police, FBI, and CIA, becomming a wanted criminal many times through out the game. Again, I don't know if that is such a good thing. It is exciting, but........ My biggest problem with the game is that children and teens will play it, and though it is not the fault of the game writers, I feel there is a moral obligation that is being sacrificed for profit. Of course, this is probably the wrong place to voice this opinion. Anyway, I gave it 3 stars for that reason. If I had no moral problem with the game I would have given it 5 stars...of course, the game is good enough that I still play once in a while so......"

399399,3,"Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth should be the 1st entry in the game series that offer above average quality but putting out an early PS2 era RPG isn't something to write home about on the PS4. The game certainly feels over a decade old, due to the barley there permutation and lack of basic comfort features. True fans of the IP will have fun, I guess, and it won't look as dated on the Vita (for better or worse) but I moved on to the similar and modern Tokyo Mirage Sessions after a few hours. Still a batter product than the new film series. 6,5/10"
397054,3,"You can play the entire 8 maps (and it has varieties of each map in terms of scope, changes etc) in about a few hours.... literally.  The rest of the game is to level up your character and get some some minor upgrades to your loadouts, which are fun at first but then become repetitive quickly as the game has no other options, upgrades, campaign, storyline, or gameplay dynamics.  It is so simple you can become really good at killing people the same way.... over .... and over ..... and over again. I promise you this is a game of grinding killing, watching beautiful scenery...... and that's it????

The DLC will probably promise more of the same thing, as I don't see there being much of a campaign (sorry guys) I feel it will just be some new maps, upgrades and that's it to tie in with the new movie.  It is really dissapointing that although fun for me, I'm just playing it to rank up to 50 as quickly as possible, yet I know there isn't much depth or content to be had.

This game is flawless in terms of jumping in and out of games as there is never a hickup in lag or entering a game, but DICE doesn't deliver on all the options of what was expected of fans from previous versions.

EX: it's like having a great steak cut.... and constantly eating that every .... everyday. haha"

222105,3,"Eyepet is a virtual pet that you can play games with as if it were really in your home. Game comes with a ""magic"" card that allows you to play with the pet outside its default playground. The magic card makes the game a little frustrating. Many of the mini games cannot be played without it, but it is difficult to keep the camera centered on the card while trying to play the game and sometimes the camera doesn't even recognize the card. Game would be a lot better if the card wasn't necessary. One fun thing about the game is dressing the pet in funny costumes and watching the pet jump when you call it. The camera can be used without the game. I rate the game three stars because it has its problems, but it is a little entertaining."

41032,3,"Rayman as a series rules, but this isn't one of their best. I think they took complaints about the difficulty level too seriously , because this game is way easy, and all about flinging fireballs madly like gauntlet more than adventuring and puzzle solving like the other ones. Also, the game is pretty short. That said, it has some good plusses as well. The visuals are awesome/fantasyish, the enemies are varied and fun, the bosses are fun to beat, and then there's the other thing; the tunnels, for lack of a better word, are what stand out in my mind. There's only like 2 or 3 in the game, but after beating it I found myself replaying them over and over again. They are tunnels with psychedelic backgrounds, wherein the jazzy/funk/orchestra music totally responds to your characters actions. It moves along and you must follow, by jumping from note to note, and if you fall(as it does move quite quickly), you are picked up and set back on again, accompanied by a wailing saxophone note or something similar. I wish there had been more of these in the game."

152875,3,"I bought the game with the idea that like the original it would have a split screen co-op story mode. I bought it so that i could play with my friends, guess what, its not available. Only co-op features are on-line and a hand full of mini missions. I'm very disappointed I bought the game just for the co-op story mode and it's not available. Otherwise the game is great, amazing graphics, good game play, but no co-op. Don't buy the game if your interested in co-op."
221312,3,Assault Horizon takes a departure from the established Ace Combat game style to a more action based game play style. The main feature of this is dogfight mode which basically turns the game into a rail style shooter. When in dogfight mode the game flys for you while you try to get a lock on the aircraft you're trying to shoot down. Most enemy aces are hard if not impossible to kill without using dogfight mode meaning if you don't care for the feature or don't wish to use it this is probably not for you. The game also has added in Call of Duty Style AC-130 missions where the game pilots you around and you give fire support to ground teams and helicopter missions that vary between rail shooters to more traditional free roams. Missions and story are a bit bland compared to the story and characters of previous Ace Combat games but its still a solid game. If you're looking for a traditional Ace Combat game this is one to skip in my opinion. If you just want to fly various aircraft and blow stuff up this is right up your alley.

170085,3,"I'm kind of two minds about this game. There's some definite pros & cons to it that kind of kept me waffling between giving this a 3 or 4 star review.

GOOD:

The story is surprisingly good & the first ending definitely managed to get under my skin & was pretty cool. I'd be willing to go from my first save data (not the clear data) in order to see the ending again. Of course there's also the true ending, which I've yet to accomplish. The artwork in this game is also pretty cute, which really helped to endear me to the characters. Liddell is a spoiled brat but the artwork & story really helped with all of that. The rune tracing is nice & since the game is pretty forgiving on the tracing, it's something that will be easy for younger (or clumsy) players to do rather easily.

BAD:

The actual fighting is pretty tedious at times & I felt like the touch screen was pretty unnecessary at times, to be honest. It came across at times like it was something that would have been a non-touch screen game with just a few minor tweaks. It also came across like the game creators came up with the story & art first but the fighting & gameplay was a second thought that got thrown together at next to the last moment. The other downfall is the game save points. There aren't that many in each level (about 2-3) & they're spaced out far enough that when you start getting tired & want to put the game down, you'll have to do a lot of backtracking in order to get to those save points. (This also backfires because when you start up again, you have to go over the same areas again.)

Overall this game ended up surprisingly better than what I'd expected it to be. Initially I was pretty bored with the gameplay but the later story made up for it. Ultimately I just feel that if the game creators had tightened things up a little bit, the game would have been that much more appealing to a wider audience. This is a pretty easy game & there's nothing wrong with that, but easy doesn't have to mean tedious & occasionally boring, which is what this game suffers from.

I really wish I could give this game that extra star for the first ending (which again, was incredibly dark & cool), but I just can't justify it. It's just frustrating that a game that could have been so much more seemed to have a staff who decided to settle for the brass ring rather than the gold one.

UPDATE:

I've completed both replays & I just have to say that it was actually a fairly boring experience the second go round. There's little to no challenge since you get to play through with your newly leveled up powers, which is probably a good thing since there's really nothing new to the game other than a new ending & a new scene in the third world.

The ending was pretty nice but it was marred by the fact that it wasn't worth the energy I put into grinding my way through the replay. Words can't stress how monotonous of a task it was & I honestly don't think that many players will really want to put the effort into seeing the ending. I liked the first ending, but I know that it'll depress many players & some won't be willing to play again to get the true ending.

The bottom line is that this is a game that could have been great but somehow got lost in a lackluster execution. With as good of a storyline as this had, there's no excuse for this & I really wish that a better company had picked it up & made it. It just deserved better than what it got."

Thank you for you time and hope you enjoy this.  UPDATE, have a new review system, hope you like.

Hey all this is Sam AKA Para in the gaming review community. This is one of many gaming reviews I will be starting for Amazon, so I hope you enjoy. Going to be talking about Sniper: Ghost Warrior and what I think could have been one of the best games for its concept; could have been is the keyword. First off let's talk about the story, without going into too much detail; I must say the story was decent at best. It kept you on the edge at some moments but others it was just sour. The moments that make this game sour are when you are not sniping and you are with an Assault Rifle (AR), it just was poorly done. The sniping portion of the game is phenomenal but here comes the AR parts and it just ruins the whole moment. Don't get me wrong, I like that they go from solo sniper to squad based AR teams, it added to the story and really flows but I will get into more detail about the gameplay next. Besides that the story head together and as far as the ending goes.......it will make you laugh and say ""Ok?"". Cut scenes were good. Over though the story could have been better but your still going to enjoy it to see what happens.

Now for gameplay, as I said earlier he AR mode of gameplay ruined the game. The problem is they didn't execute the AR gameplay well, it looked as if they stole the gameplay and pasted as theirs. It was nice they added it but again it brings the game down for how poorly it plays. Now let's forget about the AR part and talk about the awesome sniping; they nailed it perfectly. It is so much fun to be 200 yards away and just see a head pop in slow motion. The bullet time scenes are very intense to watch as how your pullet just travels through the awesome environment to reach its target. That being said the way they got wind speed, bullet drop, breathing, and the slow motion really add to the games overall concept; they really mastered it. About the graphics and sound which are simply breathing, it is amazing to see how big the world actually is. I went on a run just to see how far I could go off track and must say you can really get lost lol. I am glad they worked on making a beautiful environment, also the water will have you wanting to throw it in your face; it actually looks like fresh drinkable water and movement in water looks good. Sounds match environment dead on, fire from cans sounds real, your sniping shots are perfecting authentic, and everything just flows. Now for AI and it isn't going to be pretty. The AIs are super human (if you are playing on hard) and will see you no matter how well you hide. I was at least 300 yards away from someone in the bushes and was about to sniper when he turned around and was shooting at me with an AR and nailed me dead on. I mean they should have been the snipers, it was just weird and it didn't just happen once. It was throughout the whole game no matter how well you hide they would someone see you on certain maps. Some maps the cover system worked flawless but most the maps didn't do anything for you no matter how well you tried to hide. That also hurts the game because it took the games fun right out of it. The gameplay overall though (minus AR mode) is very fun and enjoyable.

Now for online, which is going to be short, is awful. I am not going to burn this one to the ground and stomp on it because there really isn't anything there. What I mean is multiplayer really has nothing. Yeah you got you Team Death Match, Free for All, King of the Hill, and others but there is no customization, no flare, no wow factor--it is simply boring. If they added the ability to change camo, gun, sidearm, ANYTHING--I would have given this game a better rating. You have 3 classes to choose from but 4 total types of guns to use (each class gets its own (recon has 2 choices)). If I remember correctly there are only 6 maps total to play which really is that bad but more could have helped with the loss of everything else fun. Maps are big which is a plus, radar is forever there and can be annoying cause it can in fact give your position cause all that person needs to do is scan up and down while facing your dot to get an idea of where you are. Radar in a sniper game should not exist because the point is to hide (Snipe or be Sniped). Finding matches if worse, even as the game was out for a while, online matches were small and usually not very fun. People will leave if nothing happens, which is to be expected if no one moves. They really did not put an effort into the multiplayer experience which brings the value harshly down.

Overall they had a nice concept for a game and as though they didn't ruin the concept, they really didn't do any favors for it either. There was a lot of potential for this game and I wish they would have pulled it off. Again I will say this; you should at least rent this game and give it a try. The single player is very enjoyable.

Score out of 5

Concept/Story: 4*, Ok great game concept-love sniping and they really worked hard figuring in wind speed and bullet drop-but didn't look like they put a lot of effort into the AI, basically they are the all seeing eye and will find you no matter how well you hide.

Graphics: 5*, Outstanding, the really captured the forest really well and love the rain effects. The guns look good, the sniper rifles that is, the assualt rifles (AR) are way to generic (looks stolen from other games).

Sound: 5*, Again they matched the sound with the environment really well. Guns (snipers) sound awesome but again AR generic.

Entertainment Value: 3*, Single player is fun but with the AI super human eye sight the game get stressful. Multiplayer is HORRIBLE!

Control: 4*, Takes a bit of getting use to.

Replay Value: 1*, Once you beat this game, sell it. If you rent it, return it. There is no replay because multiplayer is so small that finding matches (fun ones) are impossible

Thank you for your time, hope this review helps with your decision to buy the game. Take my word or don't take it, but this is a game worth renting, not buyng."
41957,3,"I played and beat this game on my nephews Ps2, since I don't own 1. I was expecting Resident Evil, but this game is lighter in story and gameplay by far. The characters provide funny commentary, and killing the zombies is fun, cause you bash them in the head with a shovel, or chainsaw (saw them to bits) or blow them away with a shotgun. The zombies also look funny. The puzzles were challenging but not too hard. However, this gme loses points for the length. (It simply was not long enough). Also, you don't explore new worlds, with the exception of the museum, you explore the same town, but in different time periods. Clever time and budget saver for the creators, but dissapointing to the gamers. Overall, definitly worth $5, but maybe better as a rental, rather then a buy, because it can be beat in a little less time then maybe 4 days. It took me longer cause I didn't have much time to waste on a video game. Rent it, beat it, return it. replay value is 0, but worth a playthrough at least once!"
304037,3,"Needs games, but I knew they would be unavailable everywhere so I went ahead and bought it. Killer Instinct and Forza alone will keep me entertained. The Kinect 2 isn't as fluid as I expected and using your arms and shouting at the Xbox is cumbersome. This is very unfortunate as the concept is solid, but as usual, Microsoft's implementation is awful. I loved my 360, but this is shaking down to be a little big for it's britches. They should have focused all their energy on developing new IP's rather than gimmicky shenanigans. The interface. God. Don't even get me started. The 360 dashboard is leaps and bounds better than this console. That is fixable with an update but Microsoft is so sold on this Modern UI garbage they are throwing it on everything. Also, no communication with Windows Media Center so you can stream movies to your TV from your PC? What kinda crap is that? 360 did that 7 years ago!

Minus points for requiring Gold to use Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video - services I already pay for. That's just tacky, when any other console doesn't require a membership to use basic streaming features. Hell, TV's do it now-a-days for free!

As for games. Forza is lacking tracks, but it's gorgeous other than some anti-aliasing issues (thought we were past those types of problems, but whatever Microsoft). Ryse: is a hack and slash. Beautiful, but repetitive and short. Killer Instinct is wonderful and brilliant, so I am glad. It was done so right! That's the savior of this launch lineup.

I'll play any IP's on the Xbox, but my iMac is twice as powerful. If the game is available for windows, I'll just bootcamp and play Steam games to my heart's content with my 360 controller. Can't really make a case for the $60 games anymore when they are $10-$20 on Steam during the sales they have all the time. We'll see. For now, this console is a big fat ""meh."""
25806,3,First off I have to say that I have owned every version of NHL from EA Sports ever made dating all the way back to NHL for Genesis in 1990.  And what gets me is that this is the WORST version of the game they have ever released.  I wasn't a huge fan of 2001 but it was at least solid and I know I owned it on the PC so the graphics were better but still the PS2 graphics are somewhat weak.  THe controls are fidgity and the comentary oh my lord who thought that would be funny.  The Franchise mode is still pathetic...(Lets see some impressive offseason simulation.). The game has become either a fast paced mash of buttons or just floating in unleashing slap shots at the goal.  Strategy is comming along but still the game is all arcade...
271904,3,These are ok.  They are a SNUG fit.  They do not stay charged as long as official Xbox batteries.  But for the money...you get what you pay for.
224547,3,"Overall it is a fun game, but it is a bit to repetitive. However this is much better then the movie and does the character justice. The one thing that I like about this game is Reynolds does the voice acting and reminds audiences (imo) that the lack of a good film wasn't his fault. :)"
342124,3,Its good but its not foamy lizard as specified. Mine came in a package with the labels of privacy shield but no where was it listed it was foamy lizard. The product it self is good but I would like to see items arrive from the brand you paid for
82672,3,"Theres alot in this game if your not a fan of the series prepare to feel lost and overall annoyed in how many cutscenes there are just to get the point accross. This game needed more gameplay story narrative then more cutscene narrative. As it is the game is now known as a movie with short burst of gameplay. But the story overall is a fine one and the preduction value is high overall.

Multiplayer wise the game is aimed at a more hardcore audience if your casuel online gamer you'll have a hard time making sense to all the clans,box tricks,tournaments etc. But if you do stick with it and have a bunch of friends its a blast to play."
182328,3,"Do you miss the old days of RPGs? Large character rosters, recurring enemies, sprawling worlds, dialogue that makes little sense at best? Good news! Cross Edge is, for better or worse, the most interesting attempt at a re-invention of the oldschool 8 and 16-bit RPGs that I've seen in years. It also happens to be one of the most addicting, complex but sometimes downright frustrating titles to roll onto a console in recent memory. Let it be said in advance that, despite my scoring a 7 of 10, this is certainly the most fun and most I've played any title with such a score. There's a lot to love here, but a lot of it happens to be flawed as well.

To say Cross Edge, from Nippon Ichi Software (best known for the Disgaea series), appears to be a niche title is an understatement. Not only does it meet 100% of the qualifications of the infamous JRPG formula, but its premise is based on a mashing together of settings and characters from the other titles in the NIS software lineup. In other words, it's a JRPG made up of JRPGs. Confused yet? Good. Oddly, that's part of the appeal here. You could think of the Cross Edge running as the Kingdom Hearts series of NIS. The only notable pitfall with this is that sales are a magnitude of 10 lower than the titles that comprise Square-Enix's set.

You'll be starting your adventure in the usual unknown land with mysterious creatures. In no time flat, you're sucking in new characters to your lineup. A lot of characters, actually. To be precise there are 32 voice actors listed for characters in the end credits, if you'd like some warning as to what's in store. Whether you known the characters in advance or not, you'll find them to all have their quirks. This is backed up with all the goofy dialogue you could ever ask for and a character for every RPG stereotype you can think of. The introduction to the game's combat system and basic mechanics is straightforward and will have you strutting ahead with confidence in your first levels.

Sadly, you'll probably be reconsidering that confidence in a hurry, as the learning curve becomes very steep, very fast. By the time all the game features such as item synthesis and upgrading become available you'll start to get an idea of what you've gotten yourself into. Take however insane you think that is and multiply by about 100, and you'll barely be scratching the surface of everything that's crammed on to this game. Speaking of said features, they're accessible at 'Save Points' around the map. I only mention the name specifically because, ironically, they're not where you save your game (you can do this anytime you're on the open world map), but it is where you do your business including the incredibly important revival of dead characters. Though you can revive them mid-battle, if combat ends with them KO'd you'll need to pay to have them healed here.

You certainly don't need to dive right into synthesis, but it will become a necessary evil as you move along. The usual reaction to this is ""can't I just buy everything at the shop?"". The answer is no, no you can't. You start out with only a very limited number of things you can buy and the only way to lengthen this list is via crafting it so it will appear for later purchase. Although this doesn't apply to all items (such as special weapons with unique traits), it does work for all the incredibly important medicines so that you'll have a constant supply of them if needed. If you'd like a further demonstration of how important synthesis can become, the later gear available to you can only be made using a combination of existing items combined with items dropped from monsters and items you receive from converting your old gear. Yikes. Seriously, I don't know how to accurately describe it all. The tutorials are acceptable, but no matter what you're trying to make you'll be handed a screen loaded from edge-to-edge with numbers representing different stats of the item in question. The frightening thing about this isn't so much that you're given this much info, but that all the numbers actually mean something and are something you'll have to keep track of.

In case just synthesis wasn't enough for you, there are also three very important ways to enhance the equipment you already have. Double yikes. One is to use 'EP' (one of no less than 8 types of 'points' you'll have to follow) to upgrade items between levels 1 and 5. Generally speaking this is a cheap and effective way to improve your performance, as a level 5 older item will outperform something several tiers higher. Second, you can use some of the items dropped by monsters in combat to supplement the stats of your gear. Each piece of equipment has a certain point balance which dictate how much upgrading you can do via items, and one of the eventual benefits to synthesis is that the point allowance can be much larger if you can create a high-quality item (again, using items dropped from monsters as material). Lastly, equipment has a certain number of slots that you can equip a bonus skill in. These are mostly the RPG-standard things like HP regeneration and attack bonuses, though there are dozens total. Unsurprisingly, these traits are not handed to you either, and it requires upgrading a piece of equipment to level 5 and then ""converting"" it in order to make it into a skill you can place on something else. Triple yikes.

The other major feature Save Points is the ""Database"" menu, which is something quite unique to Cross Edge. Here you can earn extra loot via earning Titles (basically mini-quests or monster hunting), and your discovery of treasure and plot events along the way will unlock costumes for everyone. Equipping a costume will change the stats of your characters in one way or another, either increasing or decreasing certain attributes. If you'd like to keep things simpler, there is at least one generic ""add HP and little else"" costume for everyone which can make obtaining these rather important. As a very JRPG-ish feature, equipping a costume on a female character changes their appearance on menus and in cutscenes. Thankfully, the most ridiculous of costumes such as swimsuits change stats such that they're impossible to leave equipped for combat and will keep your perverted mind at least a bit in check.

Wandering the world map isn't the standard you'll see in most other games. Most of note is the random encounter warning device, which is color ranging from blue and green to red when it's time to fight something. The farther you walk the more the color changes. Although untraditional and nonsensical, it's actually an awesome feature. Even better, if you deliberately want to fight something during exp grinding or the like, you can force a fight by pressing R1. No longer do you need to spin around in circles waiting for something to smack you in the face. Good times. While walking around you'll be searching for ""Souls"" (explained in the storyline), which take the form of treasure for you to collect or mark plot events around the map. One somewhat frustrating thing is that, although a lot of these events are optional, some of them you absolutely must find in order to trigger the next main plot event from appearing on the map. It can get tedious, and you will need to re-search earlier areas for new events and treasure after you move on, but doing this actually eliminates the need for substantial exp grind on normal difficulty. Merely searching should keep your levels up and will earn you Titles for the better rewards.

Your eventual opinion of the game will most certainly hinge on what you think of the battle system. It could well add or subtract 2 full points on a scale of 10 to a review score, depending on what you make of it. It's that important. No, wait. It's that COMPLICATED, I mean. In total seriousness, I have old calculus textbooks that are more straightforward than all the depth of battle here. If you peek at some game screenshots you'll get some kind of idea, as you'll note that the character and ability displays take over half the screen. Quadruple yikes. It'll take you many hours to get used to how all the different bars and arrows and numbers work. This is either a really GOOD thing, or really BAD thing, depending on how you like your RPGs. It makes the game a massive turn-off to new or more casual players, but it is massively rewarding to people who sink their teeth into it.

In short (lol?), combat is in the tried-and-true method of standing face-to-face with your foes on a flat plain. In a bit of a throwback to the old front row/back row **** each side of the field is split into a 3x4 grid of places you can stand. This is important to use and you must master positioning to be successful in combat. Depending on the character and the ability you'd like to use they have different ranges and lateral distances, so you need to think ahead to where you want to stand. For example, a member with a sword will need to stand in front to hit targets, but even then may not be able to hit the enemy back row. Your magic users need a minimum distance to cast so they'll have to stand back, but then they might not be able to reach the far targets either. Versus bosses your placement also becomes vital since you want to minimize how many characters the strongest abilities can hit at the same time. It might prevent you from a Game Over, but it makes shifting around for healing more complicated and, uh... sorry. My brain just froze for a second.

On both sides of battle, combat is run via an AP system. You get a certain number of points per turn based on your equipment, its level, your costume, etc.. With it you have up to 8 abilities per character that will become available, each of which have a different AP cost and range/area effects. Each also has a certain attack 'type' (direct, magical, break, etc.), an element attached, a strength designation from I to V, and a skill level you'll increase from 1 to 10. With alllllll this information in hand, combat revolves around skill combinations. There are over 100 different skill effects (yikes) and each has very different requirement in terms of element/type/level needed to use. The only thing that saves you from this insanity is the ""Archaic Tomb"" in the game. As you collect bits of it along the way, you can view from the menu (or even while in combat) which combinations you can pull off. They're coded by color, meaning you can either perform them immediately, or if you swap characters mid-combat, or if you equip different skills, and... wow. Uh. Ok, my brain is really hurting now. The last thing about combat I'll mention is that there is a very handy Practice Battle feature available from the game menu so you can test out your skills on dummy targets. If you're bored of the long attack animations, pressing L2 will skip the graphic, and this makes combat a lot more tolerable in repeated encounters and longer battles.

The storyline? There's a story? Oh, sorry, my brain was crammed full of combat graphics and numbers and was still overloaded from trying to explain synthesis. But yes there is a storyline, but please don't expect too much from it. Frankly, it's pieced together as well as can be expected given the insane scenario. It has characters from so many different games mixed in with all-new ones in a world setup that can only be stretched so far for it to even be theoretically imaginable instead of completely off-the-wall. In a word, it's ""fun"", with some level of character development, and some downright entertaining villains. There are rivalries and romances both amongst and between the ally and enemy forces alike, and there are some quite notable one-liners that'll keep you laughing. Did I mention there are Prinnies? No? Well, there are! By definition of how the game world is set up, there are only a maximum number of bosses to face and number of times you can fight them, but this is played out well nonetheless. Actually, I'll expand on the rivalry system. Though it doesn't change anything about combat, there are a lot of one-on-one arguments with certain foes and you are actually required to use the feuded character in your party for some combat. A minor detail but it's at least something different. The bickering can get quite grumpy and there are running gags and teasing flying everywhere.

The variety of characters and villains and how they interact is a major strength in this game, but it is also a substantial pitfall. In the bigger plot scenes, it's almost as though there was something in the contract with the voice actors to get everyone an equal number of lines. The result is very, very confusing (at best) and incomprehensible (at worse) dialogue split amongst literally 20 different people at times. The optional plot events I mentioned above to help and work on smaller group of characters, but depending on when you discover them they can seem entirely out of place and even some of the main story scenes seem to fall out of the sky and make no sense whatsoever. Unless you take the time to actually process what is said and what's going on, hours of story can fly by without really having a clue about a thing.

In closing, I'll mention how much this game caters to the 100%-clear-perfectionist types. Merely accessing the 'best' of the 3 possible endings is a massive amount of work, and as this is the only way to access post-game super-hard content it practically begs repeated plays (which are politely enhanced via the NewGame+ system). Cross Edge has, hands-down, the most ridiculous PSN trophy set put together to-date, and will take the most advanced of players with complete walkthroughs in front of them hundreds upon hundreds of hours to work out. They're so ridiculous I'm starting to think names of the people insane enough to go for the Platinum should be put up on a billboard. Seriously. It's just insane.

There's a lot of fun to be had here, and I've become quite addicted in working toward total completion. So why the meh score? Where the flaws and frustrations are here, they are really hard to get over. The finer points of synthesis and combat feel like flying a 747 as much as playing a game. Deaths are very common and you'll learn to be saving constantly. Even if you play things very well, instances of bad luck can kill you out of nowhere. Difficulty can be manic, with some tasks seeming impossible. Grind can be absolutely terrible on higher difficulty levels and the process of leveling is tied far too much with how quickly you can kill bosses, as they give more than half your total EXP and you get bonuses (from -50% to +1000%) based on speed. To get at all the features or even all the normal story scenes you MUST have a game guide. Just too many teeth-grinding issues to keep the score up. If the menus could be simplified, items and skills easily referenced, and some of the monster AI tweaked it could go a VERY long way to a better score, but even then the game certainly doesn't scream out as something truly special. Other reviews of Cross Edge have been incredibly harsh, and I wanted to put together something that at least tried to look from the bottom-up instead of the top-down.

If you're ever frustrated, just remember: Prinnies and Morrigan. Prinnies, and Morrigan."
308246,3,"The idea of cops vs. racers in an online world was no doubt intriguing but something didn't quite translate into the final product. With only six players online at a time, the game world feels empty. A lot of my time was spent driving down the same old roads over and over again looking for players, or forcing myself to play the single player races which got old quickly.  The cars available are nice enough and you can customize them to a certain extent, but there are nowhere near as many, nor are they as customizable as your well known driving sims. Different beasts I know, but the lack of options is definitely felt. This all added up to a decently enjoyable time, but one that feels a bit undercooked. I'd say your money could be spent better elsewhere."
461680,3,"Have not played this yet, it came with game playing....it did ship fast....with no booklet its difficult to figure out how to play."
489585,3,Maybe (probably) I just don't get it but I played the whole thing in nothing flat and thought there would be a way to go back and look for the rest of the objects that weren't listed the first time.  Seemed to just repeat.  It's okay except for that.
75810,3,"Stubbs is a decent game but definitely has a few problems.  Basically, you control Stubbs, who of course as the name suggests, is a zombie.  The graphics are good although there are some slight pixel problems here and there. Controls are easy to learn and the game uses the halo engine, which essentially eliminates the typical camera problems.  The music can become a bit repetitive but I tend to tune it out anyway.  Voice acting,  is also decent although hearing ""brains, brains"" over and over does get a bit tiresome.  Basically a platform game, you do get expansive areas to search but there is nothing to find.  The slow pace, even when Stubbs is supposedly running is also quite irritating.  I mean, I understand he is supposed to be a shuffling zombie but it takes forever to get anywhere and really slows the game down.  I don't expect him to have a jet pack but come on.  When you are able to use a vehicle it's a huge relief (unless it's a tractor which is even slower than Stubbs) because you can finally MOVE.

The game reminds me of 'Destroy all Humans' for a number of reasons: the futuristic yet retro setting and general look of the game, playing the bad guy and purposely killing any human that crosses your path and one other reason:  it gets really old fast.  While the game isn't bad, it is monotonous.  It fails to ever get you really involved and it is basically the same thing over and over.  There is a puzzle element in the game, in that you need to know when to pull your own head off and use it as a bowling ball to get through tough areas, or rip your hand off so it can skitter across the room and open a door or possess someone, etc.  Unfortunately, you have limited use of these items so it's back to shuffling along, swiping at the bad guys while they use guns to blow holes in your already mangled body.  Again, not a bad game especially if you need some mindless entertainment for about an hour or two.  After that, the monotony will probably turn you into a zombie.  Pick it up as a rental first as it has a hefty price tag unless you find it on clearance."
327785,3,I like the lights. But the sticks aren't very sensitive.
68720,3,"Why am I here again? The progress is here and it shows. The caddy tips are gone which means you are on your own. This game is missing players. Where are Phil Mickelson, David Toms, Jason Gore, Ernie Els, and Darrin Clarke. These guys are great players."
203465,3,"There is only one thing wrong with this game, and I am here to inform you of it before you decide to purchase this product. ""But only one thing wrong with it? How could you give it three stars?"" Because it is the most important part of any game: the controls. If you want someone drooling all over this game and praising it to the high heavens, so you can justify wasting 30 dollars on this game, there are other reviews out there doing so. You won't find that here. And look, I am a ""verified purchaser"". Nintendo got my money. What more do you want, fanboys?

Pros:
+ The graphics are the best I've seen yet on the 3DS.
+ There is so much content, meaning unlockables and modes.

Cons:
- The controls are uncomfortable to say the least. There is no possible control scheme out of the box that is remotely perfect.

If you use the default setup of using the touchscreen to aim, your left hand will cramp because you have your left index finger bent the whole time trying to hold onto the flimsy, thin L-button for dear life. Because of ""Ocarina of Time 3D"", my L-button was already on life-support, so sometimes, even when I am holding the button down all the way, it won't register on the 3DS, and projectiles won't emit from Pit's weapon.

If you use the face buttons to aim, like in the ""MGS 3"" demo, you lose precision.

If you use the circle-pad to aim, you gain the maladroitness of reversing your moving and shooting hands, something not seen since playing FPSs on the N64.

Constructive Conclusion
This game would have been awesome on the Wii. The control scheme of Sin & Punishment 2 would have worked perfectly for this game."
198295,3,"It was a short game, but fun enough. I may be done with the Halo Franchise, but I guess we'll see when I finally play Halo 4."
171125,3,"not a turn based rpg like ff10 & under,not exactly what ich expected"
447119,3,"that was basically the same title for my review of Emperor Rise of the Middle Kingdom but it's even worse here

this came before Zeus and after Caesar III so it's at a state where it's got a number of great improvements over the game engine introduced by Caesar III, but also is lacking in terms of depth and continuity as Zeus and beyond.

To begin with, juryrigging this to work on Windows 10 was a great hassle, involving many different steps I didn't keep track of and so can't relate here.  Even then, it will randomly crash at random for no reason, so I have to save every few minutes.  Sometimes it can go for hours without crashing.  Sometimes it will crash three or four times in the span of 5 minutes, then not crash at all for half an hour, then crash again.

One of my biggest complaints about EROTMK and ZMOO was that the lazy citizens expect the marketplace to come to them.  In Caesar III and Pharaoh, they go to the market themselves, so this makes it easier to keep the houses supplies, rather than having a market walker pass by three houses and completely miss the fourth one every single time despite the fourth one being closest to the market.

Water is an even bigger issue here than in other games, as it's in Egypt and even in grassy areas, there's a lot of land where it is not grassy, and the water walkers will not go very far.  The option is there for a well which only takes 1 build tile and doesn't require a worker, but a Water Supply is always superior and less disease prone.

Rather than describe and explain how every aspect of the game works I'll go into how it's different from the other historical city-builders, for good and not.

Zeus Master of Olympus was the first one to have continuous cities, where you could build a small city in one mission, then the next mission will take place in the same city and you expand on it.  Here, every single mission you have to build a whole new city from the start, so there's no use getting attached to any particular build scheme or style, particularly towards the end-game.

As well, the objectives for each mission are all dependent on scores: Prosperity, Culture, Monument, Kingdom.

Kingdom score rises from paying tribute on time, fulfilling requests, and occasionally giving gifts to pharaoh/the people from your own money

Monument score comes from building monuments

Culture score comes from basically anything that helps a city flourish, from entertainment to health to education

Prosperity score comes from having steady and stable income

Occasionally there will be another objective, such as have a certain population, or have a certain number of houses of a certain type, but ultimately it all comes down to these scores.

The requirements for some of these scores can become absurd, on Normal mode, to the point where certain missions are completely impossible if you did not follow a specific build from the very start of the mission.  You can only go up to -5000 Deben in debt before you cannot spend any more, and staying in debt means you cannot pay annual tribute.  Once your Kingdom rating goes to 0, the Pharaoh will send his army to kill you, as though it were somehow your fault for not having a thriving city in 5 years on a map with tons of fertile farmland and no ability to build any farms but to only subsist on fishing.  Even if you are Pharaoh, if you reach 0 Kingdom rating, the ""other cities"" will band together to kill you.

The combat is extremely rudimentary here, in some ways inexplicably so.  One of the things that is in ZMOO and EROTMK but for some reason not here is notification when an enemy army has been beaten or not.  You'll get tons of notifications when an enemy is coming (18 months, 1 year, 7 months, 6 months, 2 months, 1 month, arrived) and like 18,000 ones if they land more than 2 armies from transports, but you'll get absolutely no notification as to when they break and rout other than the music changing back to normal game music.  After a time, you eventually figure out on your own that no one's attacking anymore, and you send your soldiers back to their forts.

This system can also be exploited all to hell.  If your mission allows you to build walls and towers, you may as well build a short strip of wall and spam it with towers, and you will be able to defeat most armies sent against you.  Infantry require weapons, which require Copper to make, which is expensive to import, and weapons take a long time to craft, whereas Archers don't require weapons and will spawn over time just fine.  Given how enemy units will stand around waiting for the rest of their units to mobilize before attacking, you can rout out an entire infantry unit with just archers.  In most missions with military units, regular Infantry aren't worth the expense.

Monument building makes up about 50% of the base game missions and 25% of the expansion Cleopatra's missions.  It is always a hassle.  Every base monument will require peasants from a work camp and specialists from one or more guilds.  There is no way to make sure these people do their job with any regularity.  If any building resource is missing for any period of time, the stall time will be twice as long as the time it took to carve/import more.  A very common occurrence is to have stockyards filled with brick/stone/limestone/whatever you need, multiple guilds up, multiple work camps up, and NO ONE at work on the monument for months at a time.  Sometimes this is explained via the peasants being busy working on farm crops, but this will happen even on maps without farming, or during non-farming months.  Sometimes this will happen for in-game years at a time.

Some of the monument requirements are just intentionally frustrating.  Some monuments require a lump sum of stone or material just to set them down, then require MORE of that material to actually build it up.  This makes for great fun/blinding rage when a Mausoleum requires 240 sandstone just to set down to start with, and the only city selling you sandstone sells 25 stones per year, and due to unstable budget or dockyard backups, you end up with only 38 sandstone after 10 in-game years.

Prosperity rating is the next bowl of feces that is constant hell just to keep up, much less raise to the required level of later missions.  If you lose money just one year, your prosperity rating will spend the entire next year slowly going DOWN.  It will go down to 0 if you haven't recovered the losses fast enough.  The material requirements for houses in order to raise prosperity becomes a crapshoot as you have some missions you have to import basic necessities (such as Pottery, Beer, Food) and so every six months all your houses will devolve, then re-evolve when your imports reset.  The only way to win sometimes in these situations is to stockpile materials at random intervals or wait until the import limit is re-set with the new year in time for when the rest of your prosperity requirements are done.

Some of the missions are literally completely impossible unless you pre-plan EVERY SINGLE housing block to maximize the location attractiveness to evolve.  Virtually anything that goes wrong will ruin your prosperity score, and unlike the other scores, Prosperity is not instant, but very slowly goes up or down over 3 months in-game.  I had to constantly reload a save game on a mission with 14 months to complete with 55 prosperity.  I would constantly lose because the prosperity rate would take too long to reach 55 before the 14 months was up, and I hadn't saved the earlier save games of that mission.

Some other game features that frustrate and annoy: the Gods.  You need to constantly throw festivals for them to keep them happy, and constantly build more and more temples and shrines.  All of this is very expensive and if you don't keep up, they will completely ruin you and force you to restart the mission sometimes.

As well, some times you cannot help but imagine that there are arsonists loose all the time.  No matter how many firehouses I've built, I've had nonstop fires pop up in certain missions, completely wiping me out financially.  The walk-path of architects, firefighters, police, and medical persons is a total mess, necessitating you to build dozens of each of those types of buildings for pretty much every mission, no matter the size of the map.

As well, some missions have scripted events solely designed to screw you over.  Being near water means nonstop Malaria outbreaks, which no amount of Apothecaries will stop.  Other missions with scripts for bad health will come up with BS reasons for the city's health to plummet, even if you've devoted half the city's workforce just to the field of medicine.  One mission in particular is specifically designed to have nonstop health problems, and nonstop storms/obstructions to block your trade for half the year, completely out of your control and with nothing to alleviate it.

Getting certain resources to certain houses can be a pain and a nuisance for no specific reason, and sometimes for very specific reasons.  One of the main issues that happens is when a certain product (for example Straw) starts to fill up stockyards with not enough brickworks to use them.  Slowly you start running out of Pottery.  At some point, you end up with tons of potters churning out Pottery, and no place to put them as the stockyards are overflowing with Straw.  As a result, houses don't get pottery and start to devolve.  As they devolve, their population capacity drops.  As a result, mass waves of people start emigrating and suddenly your city is dangerously underpopulated and buildings are collapsing and people are starving, and all because you had too much straw in your stockyards for a few months and never realized it.

One game feature which I found to be great, but also a colossal hassle, is citizen aging.  I don't remember if this was a thing in Zeus and Emperor, but here you can see a chart that shows the average ages of your citizens.  Once they pass 50, they no longer work but still pay taxes.  As such, if you spend several decades on a mission, you'll suddenly see what seems like a huge population drop as your city starts needing more and more workers, only to realize your population hasn't dropped, you're just losing workforce, and suddenly the entire city collapses as you're down 1000 workers in a city of 8000 and none of your vital industries are working.  You can assign priorities to them to keep certain industries running at full capacity and others at lower ones, but when you're 50 years into a mission on a small map and have half your population living in densely packed houses that have suddenly devolved and you have no space to build new houses, you need to re-evolve the houses, and to do so requires full job capacity in almost every major industry.

Most of this information isn't indicated anywhere in the game; I had to find it in online guides.  Some of it IS hinted at in several of the Help topics, but the game absolutely loves to crash when you spend longer than a few seconds looking at any of the Help topics."
419262,3,"The game itself is great, I'm really enjoying playing it so far.

That being said, the packaging it came in was awful. The special edition game box itself was damaged and looked like it had been opened...They also put this awful tape on it, which when peeled off literally rips the box art off with it. Everything else inside was thankfully undamaged and intact. I just would have expected better quality packaging from something that cost me over 100$ with shipping. :/"
452224,3,"Are you a party-animal? Get this expansion pack and you'll be able to invite all your friends and have a party at your house. Be sure to prepare the everything before inviting your friends in. Prepare the food, clean-up your house, and have yourself a good mood (not hungry, enough sleep, etc).

The more friends you have, the more people are coming in to your house when you throw a party. :) This is a good way to keep the relationship between you and your friends."

37285,3,"Animal Crossing was really addictive at first, it was also somewhat fun for the first few months but after you get your expansions for your house and all the furniture you want ... there is really no point to it.  Paying off Nook may take a while but in actuality, it only takes a couple of months of Stringfish, you're done.
Getting ALL the items will take a long time but getting most of the items, especially the ones you want won't take very long, especially if you're the cheating type and go and search up cheats and/or codes on the internet, it definitely doesn't take as long.
A good thing about this game are the NES games you can have in your house and also play the ones in other people's homes.  The best one would have to be Wario's Woods.  Talking to the people in town is different and the jobs can be worth while at first but once again, after a couple of weeks ... it's repetitive and gets extremely boring.
Seriously, this game has no storyline.  It's a pointless game yet it can be addictive for the first few months you have it.  If you keep a journal in your house, and you own this game for over a year or 2, you will notice how empty some of the months are because you never play.
It's almost near impossible to make the well happy, the gifts from the mayor are stupid, worthless and again pointless and Nook, Rover and Mr. Resseti never shut up.  They talk and talk and it's so annoying.  Rover is the worst, you just want to get to the other town to get one thing and he blabs on about some crap you already know about since this is your 100th visit.
This game can be a good buy, if you really, REALLY like it ... but it will only last a couple of months before you put it on the shelf and it starts to collect dust.  I would suggest you buy it at a pawn shop for cheaper if you like it rather than spend the extra money on a game you'll never play again once you've ""beaten"" it (by that I mean pay off your loan, etc)."
223260,3,Recieved game last week and only got to the third level on quad 4 and game froze up. The other guys quad was running but mine was stopped. Couldn't dismount or anything. No help from the options table either. Ea support couldn't help either other than go online and see if I could find and answer there. I'm a COD man no wonder EA is slipping. Also game level are really short.
149613,3,"I won't waste time complaining about most of the things everyone else has mentioned, no network play, no zerg campaign etc....those things don't matter to me; I only liked playing the humans anyway.

But I have to say that the reason this only gets three stars is because, well, frankly its not that good. I mean the campaign is plenty long and I like playing against the AI for skirmishes, but this game would probably have looked this good if it came out 10 years ago. Unfortunately for Blizz, it came out about 10 days ago and it looks like they spent very little time on the graphics. Other than that its a good enough game, but I expected a lot more after waiting a decade for it."
183950,3,"I got far into this game but didn't fall in love with it like I did with Red Dead Redemption. I enjoy being able to see the character and surroundings like in Red Dead rather then a first person setting. So it didn't make the buy list, it was still alright. Like the story line, the civil war setting, and the post civil war settings. Wish they would have used a western style music instead of rock music. The canon takes some getting used to. I went to youtube to figure out how you do that. I'm forever greatful that people make youtube videos because they help out alot; well they help me alot. Once you see how to use the canon its pretty cool! Shoots pretty fast even though in real life it too about a minute to load a canon and fire it. The gatling gun is awesome too."
96758,3,"I've bought this product because i got tired of replace my batteries. The problem i've encountered was with shooters like House of the Dead or Ghost Squad to name a few. I use the Nyko Perfect shot and the problem is that the controller fits too tight in the compartment. What happens is that the trigger doesn't register the B button properly because its not settled properly. With all games though, there's no problems. The rechargle batteries last about 5 days for me. Maybe 3 for excessive use."
404670,3,"I'm not 100% sure if it's my controller or the headphones... However, I've never used the headphone jack, so I would like to blame the headphones? It seems that they only want to work some of the time. They kick in and out of audio for no reason. However, once it's on and I start my chat the mic does pick me up very well and my friends haven't complained when it works. I've had to leave parties and re enter them to get my mic reset though bc this aux jack headset oddly doesn't always maintain connection. Kind of really annoying at times."
273308,3,"Don't buy this game for the campaign - get for the multi-player, if anything i think i finished the campaign in like 5 hours  decent game though and more of the goodness that was part one - they even have a season pass that you can buy for like 30.00 that will keep you gaming for hours more.  overall this is just an average sequel to a once great game,  hope black ops 3 is much better."
47288,3,"For those of you who write reviews without owning the productor even the demo or even bothering to read pc magazines for reviews or who do not bother to go to things like E3 to look at the new innovative ideas being introduced by certain companies, let me be of aid to you.
First, Time Twister is the same pathetic attempt to acheive EA's 'The Sims' status. But why not? The Sims games are ALWAYS number one when they release, so as far as the manufacturer is concerned, they don't care what you think or feel. They make money off your greed for more of the same. So fork it over, you know you want it.
Second, It's not the same. you can bet on that. It's just not done the right way, but like I said they make money so it doesnt really matter what I think. Time Twister adds the element of scenarios from some of the first amusement parks ever built all the way to futuristic parks with outstanding and unbelievable new rollercoaster designs, and no, they didn't just make different cars for the same rides, they added new stuff, too. It adds new Six Flags rides (of course) and new Six Flags Scenarios (hopefully Astroworld and Fiesta Texas will get some recognition now, since TEXAS KICKS BUTT) along with a plethora of new theming objects that sadly could have just been added by a patch over the internet website.
Third, These games sell because even though at times they may loose their addictiveness, they are still fun to piddle around with when your board, you can do some pretty cool things, like making twisters into common shapes like airplanes or cubes or race tracks. And face it, there is a bit of a feeling of accomplishment when you finish a ride that has a skyrocketing excitement but a low nausia and intinsity, it feels like if your job now doesnt work out, at least you could design rollercoasters one day.
Fourth, those who talk bad about this game and say that it stinks are the ones that stink at it. They are not good at strategy or responsibility and keeping up with the multiple number of boundaries and buttons. And financial information can get too difficult for their puny minds, even though the box says E for everyone it should be O for Old enough to know two plus two. So don't bother taking into account their Bologne. ""DON'T BE HATIN'"" This series is great and is a lot of fun if you get into it with the mindset that you need the tutorial, YOU ARE NOT A WIZARD, you need a little help. So get the help and study the techniques, and after a while you will have a collection of coasters to be happy about and show off to your friends and to the world and who knows, maybe some day Chris Sawyer will actually pay attention to his own website and like your idea."
351713,3,"I tried to write a full review for this game but it was too lengthy and couldn't be fully explained without spoilers.  So long story short, MGS5 is not a complete game.  It's a game whose gameplay and graphics were optimized but whose story, boss battles, characters and overall gameplay design were left in rough draft form and throw together to get the game out the door by Konami and Hideo so that they could part ways.  This becomes very obvious with the quality of the story, the missing/deleted third act and the unrealized potential of some of the game's features.  If you are looking for a MGS epic, look elsewhere because it is not here. What you get here is more of a resemblance of Resident Evil 5 or 6.  Should you play this game?  Yes, just don't go in expecting much and certainly don't spend more than $30 on it."
102072,3,Good game I just didn't get into the series like a lot of other people
334052,3,"This is, artistically, a beautiful game. I love the sights, the little details of the environment, the vibrant color... The story and game-play? Not as such.

Have you played the original Bioshock? Man that game was fun. A new take on Rand with a compelling story-line of a tyrant in an underwater city; a fun, new gaming system where you wield fantastic powers in one hand and a weapon in the other. Awesome, new, riveting! And now we have... a story-line with a tyrant of a city in the clouds... Where you fight wielding powers in one hand and a gun in the other... Well, this feels familiar. A bit less innovative when you're doing the same thing 6 years later.

The story-line isn't too riveting, so much as have me following it with idle curiosity. I'm not rushing off to the next objective because I'm eager to find out more; I'm too busy wandering around aimlessly and checking out the sights until I suppose I might as well continue. The female lead (Elizabeth) is a good, strong character which is one redeeming quality and all of the characters involved have great voice acting. But considering the girl's background, her behavior doesn't match up at all which is a bit jarring. And as I continued further into the story, I was less satisfied and more annoyed by details that just felt wrong to me.

The game-play, well, it's Bioshock. Pretty much exactly like the original with a few new highlights. You'll be killing the baddies by wielding your god-like powers at them or going the old fashioned route and shooting their face in with the other. You know the drill. The most notable new feature being the ability to zip around on tracks in the air for fast travel to other parts of the map or getting the drop on the enemy. The game-play is fun but so reminiscent of previous titles that I quickly got bored and even the hard difficulty couldn't keep it interesting for me. This almost feels more like an add-on than a different game if not for the exact opposite locale.

Yeah, it's a fun game. But playing it gives me the feeling of how it could have been so more than just a beautiful setting; More than the same old mechanics and a similar but less compelling story-line. This could have been a truly unique and amazing game. Instead it strives for mediocrity. Would you kindly reach for the new and fantastic once more?

Note: More about my problems with the characters, story, and game-play in the comments. There are spoilers and seemed too long to add here."
68624,3,"Hitman Blood Money retains its original flavor from the previous games. The bald assassin in black still sneaks up pretty good behind a target, coiling a fiber wire around his fingers. There are still those ""creative"" assassination methods that 47 employs(rigging a barbecue for one,pushing off the balcony...). But the basic gameplay, for an old-timer like me, is getting a bit repetitive. Still, that shouldn't be a deterrent at all for playing this game. The few new changes like the newspaper clippings of your assassinations or the notoriety system make the game worth its salt. The plot is good and well developed as well. In conclusion, a beginner to the Hitman game series should undoubtedly start with Blood Money."
169510,3,It wasn't as great as I thought
118434,3,"There are probably two types of people out there interested in this game: people who've played one of the 18 Wheels series and people who haven't.

If you have played on of these games, skip down a bit.

If you haven't, depending on what sort of simulations you're in to, this game may give you hours of enjoyment or boredom.

The basic tack of the game is, as you'd expect, you get some money, an entry-level rig and a lack of any reputation. Your goal is to grab loads to haul and drive them across the US and to some extent Canada and Mexico. As you haul loads, you'll make more money for upgrades for your rig (or a whole new rig) and you'll gain a reputation. Your success and your reputation lead to your ability to hire on other drivers and expand your trucking empire.

To counteract your success, you'll have to deal with long (and in some cases boring) hauls, police (checking speed, general driving rules, etc), and to some extent, the competition of your fellow truckers. There's also traffic on the roads including other trucks. There used to be a bug in older versions that made traffic hazardous (cars would just randomly hit the brakes like they were trying to cause an accident) but that's gone and traffic will even yield to your turn signal. But, to compensate for this, the devs decided to throw in something else to cause you grief. If you so much as stop one inch beyond the line at a stop light, you'll be flagged as having run a red light (a fine worth up to $9000 in the game!). This and people driving in obvious violation of the law (well, at least in the states I've driven) where they're making right turns across one or more lanes of traffic (thus colliding with you and getting you in trouble with the law again) can mean you'll be dishing out a lot to pay violations. Of course, the silver lining is that you only really pay for violations if you pass within a certain distance of a parked cop car.

The graphics are passable but dated. The graphic engine won't show up on a video games award show any time soon. Cities will have some hints at their landmarks and the like but there is no real attempt to map out the city in anyway. The cities are just small hubs where you'll find services and companies to grab loads from. That said, it does what it needs to do and the rigs themselves are pretty detailed. There are several cameras you can use to check your rig out while driving plus a great top-down cam that's been in the games of the series for a while and for good reason...nothing beats using that to hitch and line up trailers. Even so, the camera can be limited (you can only zoom out so far) and with a long enough (double) trailer, you can't really see beyond about half way down the second trailer. You'll have to rely on mirrors and other camera angles to get that right.

The driving is okay but has the same limitations as any other driving game. Ideally, you'll want to use a wheel or joystick (or gamepad). I don't have any of those so I used the keyboard. The keyboard works but driving can be challenging at times given the lack of a way to ""finesse"" turns and the like. Even so, you'll largely just be more worried about getting from point A to point B. There are short cuts in places but you're largely constricted to a couple of set highways to get from city to city. Still, you've got to manage your speed (cops), your fuel (only so many gas stations), and your route (watch for those short cuts) so there are things to keep you busy even on a long haul.

Overall, the game can be fun but it's a very specific fun. I personally like business sims and love the idea of running and managing logistics and just trucking loads across America. If you're looking for a fast-paced game or a complicated economic sim, this is not the game for you. But, if you wanted to strap yourself into a rig and drive around the country hauling loads, this is the game for you. And, it also helps that the price is nice and low. This version essentially rolls up all the various updates and changes made throughout the 18 Wheels series so you're getting the best version of the simulation (with the business side as well as the rigs and some of the bug fixes).

Previous 18 Wheels Owners (Start here)

For those of you that have tried an 18 Wheels game before you should know the drill by now. The games are more of a minor evolution than a revolution as you go from game to game. At this point, though, in the series, you're getting all the enhancements that have come down the pike (the more complicated business sim, the fix for the traffic issue, the expanded map with all of North America, etc.). At the same time, if you got Haulin', you likely got most of this anyway.

So, if you haven't updated your original 18 Wheels (across america?) game, you should probably just grab this sucker (it's nice and cheap anyway) and get up to date.

If you got Haulin or are like me and got every version in the series so far, this isn't going to be pushing the envelope for you at all. Still, the map seems to be a bit different and I noticed at least one thing that was fixed (that traffic bug...where cars used to just hit the brakes all the time) and, as I mentioned, it's dirt cheap (at least right now @9.99), it might be worth the pick up just to get some of those minor enhancements. It's your money so you'll know the best approach.

All in all, I like the series despite it's issues. I, like a lot of other fans, keep holding out for that graphics upgrade and some more sophisticated aspects to the business part (and maybe an autopilot for those times when you really just don't want to do that cross-country run again). Maybe one day..."
54691,3,"After reading a plethora of reviews stating this game is the greatest GTA game yet, and considering I was a huge fan of Vice City, I just had to dish out 50 bucks for this game. Was it worth it? Well, overall I would say it definitely was worth it, just because of the sheer amount of things this game allows the player to do. You can swim, go to the gym, gain stats, date girls, do drive-bys, and a whole array of other things. However, despite the amount of things you can do, these abilities and sidequests are purely negatives. This game has a lot of problems, a lot.

Graphics- 9/10 I have heard a lot of negative things about the graphics. However, I must disagree. I think the graphics are actually pretty well crafted. Sure, the cars look a bit boxy and the overall look is reminiscent of GTA 3, but the amount of detail is amazing. The environments are perfect, especially in the country. There are hills, cliffs, mountains, rivers, bridges...there's basically everything imaginable. I especially like the blur effect. When you hit a certain speed in your vehicle, the graphics blur, and it gives you the feeling of attaining extremely high speeds, making chases fun, or just making boring, long road trips that much better. Although Vice City has better graphics, San Andreas has so much more detail to the environments and the city, so I give it props here.

Music- 5/10 Overall, Vice City's soundtrack is superior in every matter. The relatively gangster-oriented soundtrack is fitting for the setting of the game, but there are other choices ( rock and country). However, the choices are rushed/thrown in, awkward...and just plain tasteless often times. It doesn't make much sense to have an old-school country station in a game set in San Andreas, in a very ghetto area. I feel as though this was put in to add to the comedy aspect of the game, but I think it just took away from the whole feeling.  The only highlights are: Depeche Mode, STP, Soundgarden, Rod Stewart, and perhaps Danzig. There are a few other decent songs but they weren't good enough to strongly remember. Every song in Vice City was practically great, especially the Wave 103 and VRock stations. Vice city had nice, tasteful 80s songs, while San Andreas just has a relatively crappy selection.

Sound- 9/10 Not a whole lot to say here, other than the fact that the voiceovers are great. Many of the characters are quite memorable...especially the ones you encounter later on in the game. No complaints here...

Gameplay- 4/10 This is where the other shoe falls off the shelf, literally. This game is a blast in some aspects...flying in the jets, bolting across hills and flying through the air etc, but there are way too many negatives here. For starters, the map is tremendously large...this sounds like it would be great, but it is not. When you go through missions, you are almost always required to endure painstaking trips, many of which are 10 minutes long. There is a lame ""trip-skip"" feature, but this rarely helps due to the fact that it isn't offered on all the missions, and it doesn't bring you all the way back to where you were, just partially. Basically, when you die during a long mission, the game lets you return to where you died, to save some time on the trip. While this helps somewhat, it is rarely offered and therefore worthless. Also, you barely use any of the map for the missions. Many of the missions are ""clustered"" in certain areas, leaving much of the map unused. I can think of several large areas of the map which are COMPLETELY left out of the missions, which is a let-down considering these places offer some of the greatest scenery of the entire game and would have been great for missions. Furthermore, many of the side-quests are rushed and tremendously boring (who actually wants to sit through numerous gangfights, collect 100 items for a lame reward, or waste hours of their lives going on dates with girls which are extremely uneventful and not very fun...?). Some of the additions are fun, namely the driving and flying schools, the street races also, but what about the missions where you are required to fly through rings with a helicopter? Disaster, absolute disaster. Nothing is more annoying than having to restart over and over and over and over (okay you get the idea) again to complete some boring helicopter mission for less than wonderful rewards. But like I said, the environments are the only upside here .

Story- 3/10 The storyline is not only lame and stereotypical, but it is extremely juvinile and standard. Vice city had a nice 80s storyline, but was not too far from San Andreas. However, Vice City's brilliance didn't lie within its storyline, it was in the gameplay. Take a pathetic gang-banger storyline with atrocious and wretched dialougue/plot text, and add to that boring and go-nowhere gameplay and you get San Andreas. The GTA series is running out of ideas, which is understandable considering they are purely all the same. However, even so SA is a huge let-down, despite its location/year it is set in.

Overall 5/10 I actually completed this game, and I had fun in the process. I was captivated, whether it was to just finish it or I was actually having a blast. However, it is only after you beat SA that you realize how half-assed and lame the sidequests are, not to mention the gameplay. You will realize how little value this games plot has, and that you just wasted about 50 hours of your life on a pile of grubble. I would recommend to wait till the price drops to 20 bucks, since it will take too long to beat to rent it. If you REALLY can't wait (or think you can't, that is), then buy it, but beware it may be an action which you will regret. It is definitely worth playing through, I suppose, but don't expect a lot of replay value( I would rate the RV as 2/10) like Vice City. Vice City still remains the climax of the GTA series, and considering the GTA series is an almost impossible series to innovate, that probably won't change soon. Everything has been tried and tested, and Rock Star is running dry on ideas, but that is just my opinion..."
214826,3,"Basically you get an OEM Microsoft headset that only plays Xbox Live chat audio, no game audio through the headset. Note that your sound coming from your TV just got monaural after you put this thing on since one ear is blocked by the headset.

It probably won't work with the chatpad keyboard because it has the volume and plug together type dongle. It doesn't come in a package, just a plain old baggie like the one you get with a system.

It works. Not much more could be said."
31396,3,"Wreckless by Activision is a high-intense, demolition derby-like arcade racer for the Xbox which makes great use of the Xbox's ability to render great looking graphics. It's a shame that the gameplay didn't match the look of the game. The game itself is pretty fun to pick up and play for the first couple of hours, but the repetitiveness of crashing into people, other cars and just the city environment gets tiring. It doesn't help that, despite having an easy set of driving controls, Wreckless lives up to its name in terms of controlling the car.

Maybe it was done purposely, but a racer which causes a player to spin-out, fishtail and crash at the slightest bump or pebble on the course doesn't make for a high-speed gaming. It seems that there's a great game just waiting to come out of Wreckless but instead it remains locked behind a repetitious gameplay, balky driving mechanics and boring missions objectives. Wreckless does make for great eye-candy as the developers made great use of the Xbox's graphical power. The sound effects are above-average and works great with a home theater surround sound system. Definitely a rental if that at best. Criterion Studios would get it right with their Burnout series and culminating with the excellent Burnout Revenge."
148356,3,"wow let me start by agreeing with all the rest of the reviews so far. THis game is great. Good story slick graphics fun gameplay etc. My only complaint is that its HARD! I started on the easiest game mode and holy crap the bosses can combo kill youin like 20 seconds flat. the camera doesnt align itself during the action so that you can see your enemies either so you must anticipate where on the screen they will be when the stupid camera is pointing itself at a wall or some other inanimate object.  Dont get me wrong, im all for a challenging game, but when your pulling every combo availible and using your entire healing inventory just to attempt to beat the third boss guy and still manage to die oh only about 20 times in a row- it stops being a fun challenge and just starts getting frustrating. good game but easy mode is NOT easy."
153400,3,"This is a game with breathtaking next-gen graphics and is fun to play, but there are some deeper problems I've found. The hit stick is far too effective, the quarterbacks(no matter how sorry their ratings may be) complete about 80-90 percent of all passes, and I can't put together ANY kind of a rushing attack. So, if you like playing football just for fun with your friends you'll probably find this one to be quite impressive. But if you're a hardcore football gamer you'll see some problems and unrealistic stuff going on in this game."
311328,3,"Great graphics, accurate controls, smooth gameplay... Lacking any form of solo/campaign play. Overall ""meh"" for next-gen."
439559,3,"The Good:
I like the size and shape of the mouse, just wish there was a small resting area below the 12 keys for your thumb.
The ability to slide the 12 keys to your position is also good.
Mouse tracking is good on both plastic and cloth surfaces.
The bad:
Stupid Corsair USB plugs are too fat.
The mouse wheel makes a clunky rattling noise that I just can't ignore and hasn't gone away since opening the package.
Iv'e gotten use to the software but it still sucks.
Don't really like the dps indicator. Like to keep things the same color profile and that makes it hard to see what dpi point your at.
Corsair logo LED has a red tint to it on light colors.
The 12 side keys are just a little too big. Hard to reach from 1-12. Mostly use 1-9 or 4-12 when playing."
395111,3,"Game plays OK, but on my PS4 I was expecting a higher quality graphic detail  -- maybe because I just finished Doom which has incredible graphics. Many scenes looked like PS3.  If the game plays great, maybe I'll come back and add a star."

226753,3,"Runaway favorite for ""game with the strangest name"" for 2011, Hyperdimension Neptuina is sequel-in-spirit to 2010's Trinity Universe, with the same combat and exploration systems. We do have plenty of differences, though...

First thing most will notice is the unusual setting-- literally called Gamindustri, during a troubled time in its history, The Console Wars. Yes, really. Accordingly, different continents are all wordplay relating to the current generation of consoles. There are a lot of overall concepts and ongoing themes through the game like this, where there's no real impact on the game itself, but fans of series or persons that know some video game history will get a bit more out of it. Really, I have to give credit for piecing the game world up this way, as being something never really attempted before. Boldness often leads to good things!

Another quirk you'll spot quickly is that all the protagonist party characters are named after the studios and development companies involved in the game's creation. Again, extremely cute, extremely silly. For added irony, the group plays itself out to be a stereotypical RPG adventuring group, completely ignoring the so-called Fourth Wall in games. Logic such as ""once you join the party you can never leave"" and ""I bet that NPC has lower stats than me so let's beat her up"" apply. Constant references to all things gaming: culture, stereotypes, common expressions, ""blogs"" written by higher-up villains, and tons more. It's more than any one person could spot on their own.

Right, so the setting is unlike anything really seen before, has undeniable humor and charm, and gives a pretty open slate. What about the actual gameplay, you ask? This is where things take a tumble. How much of a tumble really depends on what experience you're looking for. This game is in no way developed with the ""serious gamer"" in mind. One could enjoy it, but more for completion purposes than soaking in the game experience. It's extremely lighthearted, with a non-linear relaxed pace, generally slow combat speed and relatively low difficulty. Combat is based on setting up skill combinations, though it must be done manually from a menu and adjusted often as you learn more abilities. Still with me? Read on.

With the slower battle pace, things can get extremely boring. Well, either boring or time consuming, or both. Sure, you can perform a flashy attack and combo, if you don't mind some attack animations in the 10+ second range, and mostly repeat. In the end, it's by far easiest and most effective to repeatedly use a character's strongest attack, which results in near button-mashing to get through a fight. There is one work-around on the time consumption; pressing L2 will skip the current animation and greatly speed up battles, though its liberal use merely means even more continuous button-mashing, and you'll see no action at all even in a big fight.

There's just a layer of depth that's missing to add true variety. One common activity is a dungeon ""time attack"" to perform a certain task, and though that sounds simple enough, liberal use of L2 is basically required for a good score; The game rather contradicting itself. I'll again emphasize that for the most casual player all of the above is not the worst thing.

Standard RPG item use system for cures and the like? Does not exist, and very frustrating. ALL forms of curing or recovery are performed via certain ""item skill"" triggers that the player sets up a percentage chance of a character using if conditions are met. Simplest being to set ""use cure item at 50% HP"", akin to Final Fantasy XII's gambit system, but you're limited on allocation points such that it's often not possible to resurrect someone, or you just have a random chance to, or can only perform this at higher levels. In defense, with the relatively low difficulty this might not feel particularly vital, but it's still quite annoying.

I'd like to comment again on the target audience, with the game presented. On one side, one might make the point that it's but 'fanservice' to the usual audience with its 100% all-female cast. However, I'd far more make the case that the game is an attempt to attract the more casual gamer and women as players. Although one might assume an all-female cast would be a field day for ""normal"" RPG shenanigans of animations and pictures, at no point is sex appeal really pushed to get a reaction from the player. Quite the opposite-- the characters are dressed very moderately and have extremely ""normal"" appearances (for an RPG) for the most part. Though I give high marks for the efforts in this area, I feel that the game on the whole suffered a bit in trying to find a balance that would try to please everyone.

Still, it is good fun, and good laughs. The story is pretty shallow, but as it's driven mostly by humor and RPG stereotypes it hardly matters. Graphics are a bit garbled, but it has no effect on the game itself. Fans of other games in the ongoing Gust/NIS/Idea Factory/Compile Heart series of games will likely be content to play Neptunia assuming they walk in with fairly low expectations, and I'll be bold to say that those that are curious about the genre might pick this as a place to jump in because of the attempted accessibility. It's rare for me on a 3-of-5 review, but I've got to say that because of the slower pace and humor, this could be a good chance for new players to hop into the genre."

94174,3,"Be prepared to fight not with rival armies but with the disc itself. After updating my drive's firmware and installing an optional Windows patch for reading secure discs the PC finally recognized that the game was, in fact, inserted. Whether the files are accessible or not depends upon its mood. This seems to be a somewhat common phenomenon. Once visible, copying the entirety of each game folder and installing from the desktop worked fine. Thankfully the disc isn't necessary beyond housing the installation files.

The games are worth the trouble involved in installing them. You, too, can lead a coalition of tiny men in undershorts and tame the wilderness and build mighty civilizations in Age of Empires! Age of Empires II expands to add women and more clothing in the goal of building the best possible medieval stronghold while smoothing out some rough edges found in the original.

Strangely, the 'soundtrack' comprising of wav files is amazingly difficult to copy due to read errors. Bizarre."
30068,3,"Pros:

- Very creepy atmosphere.
- Highly psychological horrific story.

Cons:

- Controls are clunky.  Especially in combat, I feel more like I'm fighting the controls than I am the monsters.

- Cameras are way off.  Half the time, when the character is looking right at monsters, I can't even see them.

- Feels like the challenge of the game comes not from the enemies and obstacles actually being tough, but from the game actually handicapping me, the player.

- Doesn't work well on a 360; lots of broken textures in certain locations.

- Load times are atrocious.

I love this game for the story.  It's a horrific tale told from the perspective of James, a man who received a letter from his wife asking him to meet in Silent Hill.  The only problem is that she's dead.  What James encounters in Silent Hill instead is something of a personal hell for him.  The atmosphere is very creepy; the darkness and fog, along with the noise, make for a very tense and scary environment.  It's a very well crafted tale, and worth playing just for that.

But, as stated above, the game does have severe problems.  It's not really compatible with the 360, if that's what you're going to play it on, so I advise using either the original XBox or get another version of the game.  I don't know if the downloadable version is any better.

The gameplay is also very clunky and hard to get used to.  I get the idea that they weren't going for an action/adventure, but often times I feel that the game's controls and wonky camera control are intended to handicap me, the player.  It feels unfair most of the time.  A better way to handle this would have been to make the controls more fluid and the camera more player friendly, but make the monsters tougher.

If you can get past the gameplay flaws, I still recommend it; the story is worth it."

158409,3,"The Japanese RPG genre has struggled to remain viable in today's video game market. With the poor showing as a possibility for any Japanese RPG in the western market, there is pressure on developers to change their formula in one way or another. Tales of Vesperia goes against the grain, in that it doesn't try to change anything. For fans this slight evolutionary step might be enough, but this game doesn't make any attempt to draw a new crowd.

Being on the 360, the game does move the series forward in obvious ways. The graphics, still cell shaded, are more detailed in just about every way. The game also takes good advantage of 5.1 sound if you have the system. The widescreen display does well for the battles and keeping all your characters in a viewable area. That said, these things are really all considered standard on any Xbox 360 game.

The rest of the game is pretty much like any one of its PS2 counterparts. That isn't to say it is bad. The characters and plot are all compelling and the real time tales battle system is still very fun. The downside is that the game still plays very slowly compared to other modern games. You still have the encounters where it loads a battle scene, and then when you win you still have a victory screen showing the results. That slows down the game considerably, but you can always avoid battles since the enemies are visible on screen. I also felt the story sequences could have been speed up a little. When the game is just starting you get a lot of story and it feels like it takes a while for it to pick up momentum.

All in all the game is exactly what fans expected. It doesn't have any surprise turn offs, but there really isn't much to set this game apart. If you're a fan of Japanese RPGs then I'm sure they will plenty to like. If historically you've avoided the genre, there isn't anything here that will change your mind. It is a good game, but its been done before."
183921,3,"I bought this for my husband a little over a year ago. It worked great for a while. Within the last few months it seems to not be charging the batteries very well. They only end up staying charged for a few hours (not of straight play time). And there's one battery that won't charge at all. I'll put a completely dead battery on the charger and less than 5 minutes later it'll say that it's completely charged? We've even gone as far as to kind of ignore the lights (thinking maybe it's a short) and just charge the batteries for a couple hours and then use them...but they'll just die around 20 minutes later.
It is a good product, it's saving us tons on batteries. Maybe it's only supposed to work for a year, I don't know. It still works, just not as well."

63630,3,"The day this game came out I was so excited because on the Starwars Trilogy DVD collection bonus disk it said that this game was going to have the best controls ever. When I saw this I was expecting to use the right thumb stick, and which ever way you moved the thumb stick your character would move his light saber, like on the game Starwars Obi Won; only with more control. Except when I was playing this game I discovered that instead of using the thumb stick you would use the X,Y, or B button, which I found disapointing. The good part about using the X,Y, and B button was that you could make cool combinations with them.

  Another disapointment about this game was that in my opinion it was way to short. You could easily beat this game in a average of 2 to 3 hours; But I guess I shouldn't be upset because the game was to short because it was supposed to be like the movie and it was. I'm not saying that this game wasn't fun, because it was fun. It was fun to play some levels over again, or playing your friends on versus mode.

  I would compare this game to Lord of the Rings the Return of the King, because the controls are almost exacly the same and at the end of each level it shows you how many kills you got and whether they were ""fair"", ""good"", ""excelent"", or ""masterful"", and you also can unlock new moves and abilities (just like Lord of the Rings).

  If you havn't played this game before and are thinking of buying it I suggest you rent it first and see if you like it."
264893,3,"Coming it at nearly twice the thickness of the PS Vita itself, Sony probably means ""put it in your luggage"" when they say ""travel pouch"". It's padded reasonably well for being transported in luggage, a laptop bag, etc., but I'm not sure I'd want it to be a standalone case.

I hadn't seen this in person before ordering, so I was a little surprised by how soft the case is -- not only in feel, but construction. It just isn't going to stand up to too much.

The interior divider does a great job of holding games, but isn't stitched all the way through, so there's some risk of hard objects one one side scratching the other side, if the divider shifts too much. Similarly, I definitely wouldn't want to use this for carrying around much more than a USB cable, cleaning cloth, and some games. Fitting the AC adapter and power cord in the pouch is possible, I guess, but I'd be really concerned about the plug scratching my Vita.

Amazon usually has this for almost half off MSRP, which is a very nice deal. At full price though, I can't say I'd recommend this."

113534,3,"It works (kinda) in Rock Band (a great game, IMHO), it's shaped decent, and that's about all the good things to say about it.  I find the strum bar to be too mushy and it doesn't spring back to it's starting position very well.  I've had to replace this with Harmonix and the replacement was still mushy.  For what you pay, they could at least put in a decent switch/strum.  I got a strum bar mod and switchplate to fix it and now it works fine and it much more fun to use.  Do a search for 'rock band strum fix' to find the site that sells the upgrade/fix if you're interested."
320059,3,"Most people will probably get this case for the aesthetics, which is where it shines. The 3DS is held in place inside the case by a thick elastic band so it won't flop around. There's a slot that will hold six games and an elastic loop that will hold an additional stylus. The case looks nice and the material appears to be durable.

However, the case has very little padding. I didn't see any reviews mentioning the lack of padding either. Most people get cases as a way to protect their devices, and the lack of padding in this case is a detriment. If you're looking to protect your 3DS this might not be the case to get. With that said, I keep my 3DS in one of Hori's Duraflex Shells and the case will hold my 3DS with the shell, albeit very snuggly.

Also, I'm not sure what kind of manufacturing process Hori uses but when the case comes out of the box, it smells TERRIBLE. There's a very strong chemical smell. I had to let the case air out for a few days and it was fine, but I wouldn't recommend using it right away if smells bother you. I didn't want to put my 3DS into the case without airing it out because the smell might stick to the 3DS. After letting it air out for a few days I can't smell anything, but initially it was AWFUL.

If you're interested in the style and not protection then this case is a good choice. If you want something for protection, I would suggest also purchasing the Hori Duraflex Shell to use with this, or buying a case with more substantial padding."
119336,3,Never wrote a review about the 360 until i started having problems out of my system...The red-ring of death is a big issue with this system!! I purchased  the 360 premium at launch and didn't really have issues until around 1 1/2 years later at this point ive had 4 360s!!!! I am a hardcore gamer period own all systems except the Wii because i am a hardcore not a casual!!..Anyways great games for 360 but alot of fps have flooded this system i am a fan but nothing new to the table..I mean these are my opinions so you judge yourself...But do ya research on the system yea they are backing them but its ignorant that they are even breaking...But microsoft is known for glitchy things...Good luck on your purchase!!
91692,3,"I am a huge GTA fan and I, too, purchased this game on release night.  After 6 months, I totally regret the experienced as well as the anticipation for this game.

Here is the pros;
1. Graphics are the best in video games period.
2. Music is stellar, but pop or more popular tracks are rare.
3. Loading time is excellent with the exception of the installation and beginning of the game.

CONS;
1. Cover system is weak.  When trying to cover from enemies, occasionally you end up lean towards the wrong cover.
2. Driving is laughable in a bad way.  I understand the realizism their trying to create, but driving 7 mph doesn't NOT cause a vehicle to fishtail or achieve a reverse 180 degree turn.  What? Is this Liberty City's streets covered in butter.
(Rockstar won't fix that is a problem)
1. The whole loading/saving procedure is annoying and tiresome.  I'm playing and I don't need to spend 7 minutes to get to a saving/loading area.
2. Respawning vehicles was annoying in GTA: San Andreas and it's very annoying here.  Mercenaries(Glitch-o-mania) and Far Cry 2 have fix this problem, but Rockstar seem to think that it's fun for players to have cop cars and others to magically appear when, at first glance, looked like a clear road.
3. Driving.

This game is worth renting.  Wait until the price gets closer to $40 dollars than its worth purchasing."

53705,3,"I was really looking forward to this game.  I'm a big fan of shooters like Halo and the Tom Clancy games and this idea sounded and is still great.  I must say that I was expecting a Rainbow Six type game set in the Star Wars universe.  This game does not even come close to Halo or Rainbow in play or in story. The sound was alright and the graphics were acceptable, but neither knocked me out of my seat.  To be honest, the graphics seemed more like a 90's arcade game.  I'm not a big fan of running around with a bunch of other people just running and gunning, but if you are I don't think that you'll be disspointed.  One major gripe that I have is the weapons, especially the sniper rifles....if we had stinkers like those today, we wouldn't have snipers at all.  Since when does it take 2 headshots to kill someone and since when does a sniper rifle or other blaster shoot all over the place half of the time?  I am probably judging this game a little too harshly, but after Ghost Recons and Halo how can you accept less?  To sum it up, die hard Star Wars fans get this game and you'll probably be satisfied; fans of online shooting get this game at a discount;  someone looking to try a shooter for the first time, look elsewhere; if you like Star Wars and shooters, get this at a discount.  The best advice I can give is game makers look at the best games for ideas and game buyers get this one when it comes down to under 20 bucks.  Save your big money for Halo 2, Ghost Recon 2, Splinter Cell 2/3, Men of Valor and Brothers in Arms."
283594,3,"This mouse used to be great, now it's just.... eh....

I tried returning the one I got because I thought it was just a dud, and the new one was the same.

It's almost like the same issue with the Wired Mamba.

51577,3,"I was never a big fan of the popular Diablo series.  I was even offended when the game referred to itself as an RPG when I thought it was nothing more than hack and slash repetitiveness.  So when Dungeon Siege was released with the promises of being a beautifully rendered 3-D Diablo clone, I didn't order this baby as soon as it was released even though it did have some impressive screenshots. Well, I finally gave in after the expansion game was released because unlike other expansions, Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna actually comes with the original game as well. Hey, I have no problem with a braindead game that acts as temporary mind candy. I've been through my fair share of boring shoot 'em ups, and I did have some fun for a few days with Dungeon Siege.  I enjoyed upgrading my party and their skill levels.  There were some great looking dungeons and plains to roam but some of them started getting boring.  I have no problem with a mindless dungeon romp but after the 18,000th goblin, the game starts to get old.  It also gets old when I realize that all of my equipment is the same, it just goes up in damage and armor levels.  The graphics, music, audio effects and stability of this game are top notch.  One of the best production values of current games, but somehow during the production of this game, the designers forgot the most important element of any video game - fun!  . Another unfortunate feature of this game is while it has a BEAUTIFUL engine, nothing really ever became of the toolset and custom mod community. There are people that enjoy this game but I have no idea how close I came to completing the original game because I was bored to tears halfway through.  Dungeon Siege is one of those titles that is worth it when the price drops but a game that might leave you feeling ripped off if you buy it at a current release price."
358266,3,"thats it, attractive game but poor content... But it still funny."
180016,3,"For those of you not familiar, ""Prinnies"" are the penguin-like servants of the main characters in Disgaea.  Disgaea is a turn-based fantasy game (and a strange one at that), but this game is a side-scrolling platformer.

In ""Prinny:  Can I Really Be The Hero?"", you take control of an army of 1,000 Prinnies, one at a time (your ""lives"" to beat the game).  You have a standard arsenal of attacks:  up close your Prinny will use his sword, he can jump up over bad guys and ""butt-bash"" them to stun them, and from a distance he can leap and fling infinite sword-blades, slowly dropping back to earth.  An interesting touch is that using this jumping special attack will cause the 2-D realm to pivot and give you a momentary 3-D view of the action.  This doesn't do you any good; it's just for effect.  Prinnies can also grab onto ledges and haul themselves up, but they don't appear capable of lowering themselves down.

Unfortunately, despite bright colors, silly dialogue, and lots of eccentric cuteness, there are some gameplay problems that keep this game from really being great.  There's lag when turning around or stunning, getting the timing of jumps can be very difficult, and the double-jumps, while very high, are also very hard to control.  It's really easy to get yourself knocked off a cliff, and worse still, getting hit can make you ""bounce"" and go off an edge.  The addition of ""bomb"" attacks is cute:  you can pick up a cartoon bomb and throw it.  However, it's easy to drop it, and even have it explode in your hands.  Most of the time you play this game, you'll find yourself knowing what you want to happen, having your timing perfect, but then watching it fail to execute.  It can get very frustrating, and I've had to take the gameplay in small doses so as not to get too aggravated.

The copy of ""Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?"" that I received came in a box containing the standard plastic PSP game case, a booklet, the UMD of course, and also a CD of the soundtrack, complete with colorful cartoons and Japanese text in the liner notes.  I don't recommend the game for children, and I do recommend that interested teens or adults have good twitch reflexes, and lots of patience."
124456,3,"As a long-time fan of the RE series I was a little bit disappointed with the game.  I loved the characters, especially Sheva.  Unfortunately the storyline lacks the quality you see in other 3rd person shooters on the xbox like Gears of War.  The A.I. is nonexistent as far as your partner is concerned using up your herbs when a nail is broken or not backing you when the enemies get overwhelming.  After coming from such a great game like RE4 I think we all expected a experience similar or better than it's predecessor.

Multiplayer is very good as well as co-op, nothing better than another human being taking over Sheva and playing single player.  For the price of 15 it's a good pick, especially with RE6 coming out this fall."

It was not very obvious at first, but you will notice it after a while.  Plus the trigger sticks once in a while."
85791,3,"I loved this game at the beginning: combat is arcade-ish but fun, it's an RPG that doesn't get consumed in mathematical details, it's fun being able to buy all the houses and businesses in the towns you go to...

But in the end (a few days later) I felt like the game could have been amazing, but wasn't quite there.  The main problem was the storyline.  I didn't mind that it was a trifle, I don't go into a computer game expecting a Russian novel.  I minded that it ended so quickly, and before I really had any idea that it was about to end.  There's many side-quests you can still go on after that, but narratively speaking it just doesn't seem right.  A game which allows you to buy fortresses or even castles should somehow incorporate being a virtual king into the storyline.  Instead the storyline is mostly just hack and slash for 5-10 hours until a bunch of monsters are killed, then you win.

You're able to have a different reputation with everybody you come across, and get married, and so on and so forth.  That all sounds very interesting, until you realize there's really about a dozen people in the entire kingdom, just copied over and over.  You're able to buy a house, but you're not allowed to really do anything interesting with the house, just upgrade the furniture to more expensive furniture, all of the same style.

Unfortunately I hear Fable 3 is a small step back, although even so I'd like to give it a try someday."
325402,3,"This is too small for you to be able to rotate both thumbsticks at the same time. You need to do that in some games. It's really only appropriate for children. If they made it larger like a logitech then it would be a nice gamepad. However, I use this gamepad for all my fighting games. It works better than the standard PS3 controller becuase the buttons are all closer together which allows me to press the combos faster. It really is an advantage over the PS3 controller on fighting games. Also, I've had 3 PS3 controllers breaks in the exact same way from playing one game(Fight Night Champion) My HORI has not broken after a very long usage period, and its cheaper than they are. So I reccomend it for fighting games but not for others when you're rotating both thumbsticks alot."

I would have given this a pass, except that mouse weight is a selling point, and it's completely thrown away by the fact that the mouse itself has a shifting metal weight on the top of it.

Mouse sensitivity and lighting is on point.  Love the software and the fact I can load my profiles directly onto the mouse, then use it on another computer without any downloads.  Infinite scroll is incredibly useful.  Overall I like this mouse, but I that scroll wheel issue needs to be addressed if Logitech wants to keep me from jumping to a new company with my next upgrade."
288102,3,"When Lego Batman 2 was released, it brought huge changes to Traveller's Tales' series of Lego-themed games. What was once a linear adventure through Lego-ized versions of your favorite franchises had become an open world epic with a huge city to explore and a smartly funny script, that was just as enjoyable to an adult as it was to the game's ""target audience"". This July's Lego City Undercover built on this new formula, giving players more to do in the game's world, and now Lego Marvel attempts to hone this style of gameplay to a razor's edge. Gameplay-wise, it succeeds, but there are some serious technical issues that hold this game back from its true potential.

The game's structure has you playing through a series of linear levels as a group of Marvel Heroes, and between levels you can travel freely around New York City and do side missions to kill time and work on getting 100% completion. The levels are well designed, featuring fun puzzles that make good usage of your character's powers. Furthermore, the game's story is very well-written and the voice acting is top-notch. It genuinely feels like playing a Marvel Movie, and the script captured the Marvel humor that makes the films so memorable.

Visually, Lego Marvel is consistently beautiful, with some areas looking photorealistic, which sounds like a weird fit for a cartoony Lego game, but works surprisingly well. The animations are full of life and character, and the game's cutscenes could easily pass as an animated television series.

 New York is brilliantly realized. Lego Batman 2's Gotham city didn't give players much to do other than platforming and vehicle challenges, and non-player characters were limited to screaming citizens and random thugs. In Lego City Undercover, the City felt much more like a living city, having passersby go around the city doing things and occasionally make comments as you pass, and also adding a great deal of different side-missions to accomplish. Lego Marvel trumps both of these cities easily by actually letting you talk to some of the citizens, who will send you on a variety of quests. Furthermore, New York is probably the biggest world yet in a Lego Game, recreating the entire island of Manhattan. Another improvement Lego Marvel brings is that there are actually several optional levels that you can unlock around the city, each taking place inside one of New York's buildings, whereas prior Lego titles only had one bonus level at the end of the game. One particularly memorable level sees you entering Marvel's corporate headquarters and saving two of the company's real-world comic writers from a surprising pair of villains (I won't spoil who they are, it needs to be seen to be believed). There are fewer types of side-missions in Marvel than in Lego City Undercover, but most of the mission types that were dropped weren't very interesting (such as painting things a certain color, or destroying an arbitrary amount of things), so quality beats out quantity in this case (although I do miss collecting bricks to make ""superbuilds"", which was enjoyable in Undercover). One nice thing exclusive to the Wii U version is that you can have the world map up at all times on the Wii U gamepad. The map in this game is much more specific than the maps in Lego Batman 2 and Lego City Undercover, usually telling you right where a challenge is, meaning you can spend more time actually working towards things, and less time wandering aimlessly.

 Unfortunately, for all the brilliant things this game does, I can't give it any more than 3 stars because it has several unacceptable technical problems that bring the game down.

 First and foremost, this game crashes with alarming frequency. It crashed multiple times when attempting to use the elevator on the SHIELD Helicarrier (this particular crashed seems to always happen when playing as Mr. Fantastic). This completely crashes the Wii U system and forces you to do a hard reset, which is particularly unpleasant as the Wii U is notorious for having long boot-up times. This elevator is something that players will be needing to use a lot, as it leads to the various rooms for tracking game progress, so one would think the testers would have caught this, but apparently not.

 Another ridiculous crash occurs after a fight with Loki. When you deliver the finishing blow on Loki, the game oftentimes crashes to black. This happened twice before working on the third try. During the fight with Loki, there are some frost giants on the playing field, and the crash seems to be linked to trying to finish off Loki without having defeated all of the frost giants beforehand. These conditions are a common scenario when playing this particular fight, and I'm not the only one experienced this glitch, so why the game's testers didn't notice this is beyond me.

Other glitches prevent your characters from properly respawning after falling into a bottomless pit. I was playing one level as Wolverine and accidentally fell into the water, but instead of respawning on land, Wolverine kept spawning over the water, becoming stuck in an infinite death loop. This happened in multiple levels, which was frustrating. Even more frustrating was in the Latveria level, where I accidentally fell into the abyss as Nick Fury, but instead of dying, my character was stuck under the level, walking around in an empty void. Fortunately Fury's skill's weren't required to progress in that particular level, so I was able to complete that portion without him, but it's ridiculous that something like this made it into the game.

 As annoying as the previous glitches are, they can be recovered from, and therefore may be overlooked by a patient player. The worst glitch however, is one that basically made the game impossible to tuly complete. In the open-world New York sections, you can come across beloved Marvel writer Stan Lee, who finds himself in wacky situations that you have to save him from. I was looking forward to this part of the game, as I love Stan Lee and the first few scenarios were fun to solve. Eventually, I reached a scenario where Stan is flailing around on an uncontrollable fire hose. As I went so solve this problem, Stan, the hose, and the switch to turn the hose off suddenly disappeared, even though I hadn't solved the puzzle yet. The autosave then symbol popped up, meaning that this anomaly had been saved to my file. At first, I wasn't worried, because the counter that keeps track of Stan Lees saved seemed to count this as a success, but when I got to the next Stan Lee scenario, which features him standing under a crane that needs to be moved, I immediately knew something was wrong. To solve this puzzle, you go into the cockpit of the crane and flip a switch. I looked up a video of the puzzle being solved to confirm this, but while the switch was present in my game, it was unable to be interacted with, meaning that it was impossible to rescue this Stan Lee, and that it is now impossible to complete the game 100% on this save file. If I want to get 100% completion, I will now have to restart the entire game from the beginning, which isn't something I am opposed to, but knowing that this sort of glitch could happen again destroys my motivation to do so. This is a shame, because trying for 100% completion is one of the biggest draws of these Lego games.

 If you can look past Lego Marvel's issues, you'll find an extremely fun game, and I did legitimately enjoy most of my time playing it, but the glitch that made the game unwinnable ruined my desire to play it any further, which is disappointing. What makes these problems worse is that the previous Lego game on the Wii U, Lego City Undercover, didn't seem to have any glitches whatsoever, so the poor state of this game really can't be forgiven. In theory, it's nothing that can't be patched, but the game has been out since October, so I think that if there was going to be a patch, it would have been out by now. If the game didn't have all these problems, I would easily get it five stars, and if it does get patched, I will gladly update my review, but for now these problems make it hard for me to give it anything more than three stars out of five."

101785,3,"Good browser but could be better.  The DS Lite browser is a bit slow, perhaps comparable to dial-up speed.  The keypad is setup like the Wii's, but unlike the opera browser for the Wii there's no word prediction list, meaning you'll have to tap the screen for every single letter.  It does not support sound either.  However, I do enjoy the fact that we can bookmark sites and utilize the search function.  Overall it is a decent browser and I would recommend it to those who travel or those without laptops, pdas, etc. as an alternative to connect to the internet.  Most (if not all) McDonald's locations support the wifi browser, so you will most likely be able to browse there for free (and there are tons of Mickey D's everywhere!).  Just keep in mind you won't be able to watch videos on sites like youtube or play flash games.

Pros:
-Overview mode (enables you to see an overview of the web page, you can use the stylus to browse while the top screen of the DS will zoom in enough for you to see what you're browsing close up.)

-Search function

Cons:
-Speed is a bit slow
-No Java or flash

127408,3,"This game follows a writer named Alan Wake as he and his wife go to a small town up in Washington State. Weird and creepy stuff occurs, that draws Alan and his wife into the mystery.

The graphics are quite good (of course, as all game makers want to draw you in with that aspect of their games), but the motion of the playable character leaves a bit to be desired. There are tons of collectibles throughout this game that allow you to gain achievements.

The story isn' t bad,; there have been worse...

However, a couple of things irked me to NO END ... !!! ...

Why do you have to start each episode with nothing (no weapons or supplies)??? This guy has no pockets to carry over all (... or at least a quarter of all ...) the stuff he collected throughout the previous episode(s)??? Come on!!!

In just about every other video game, the playable character gets ability upgrades of SOME type. They can't even let this dude run faster or jump higher, or SOMETHING?

I bought this used from a store, so after playing it for a while, I CANNOT say that it was a waste of 17 bucks."
62620,3,"Nope. This game got on my last nerve. I was absolutely compelled to take it back to the used video game shop & get my money back in less than a week. First I want to point out how annoying the voices of the AI enemies are. There are two main things they say when they notice you, being;

1)""Doe-Ray-Me-Fa-So long, Sucka!"" and
2)""You can die fast or you can die slow, your choice, Doc!""

or something like that. I tell you, when you've heard each of these inane litanies for the 100th time, you get [...] After such audio masterpeices as ""Halo"" & even ""Raze's Hell"" (who ever heard that game's AI chatter?) you really see how shoddy ""Pariah"" is in the voice department. Graphics were just so-so. At the time the game came out, being on Xbox, this thing should've looked better. Game play just did not impress me in any way. If you are gonna do a first person shooter you need to do it really well or bring something new to the table. No such luck here.

Maybe to online Xbox Live game play is good? I did not have Xbox Live at the time I owned a copy of ""Pariah"" so maybe the game has a redeeming multiplayer aspect.

...That single-player story mode was for the birds."
307069,3,This game is alright for the most part but i will say that there are many bugs and add-ons that need to be done to the game. this game has frozen on me a few times in witch i was a little upset as i was in a middle of a match. but also this game does not have No tournament mode. this was a big thing i was looking forward to but i guess we are just going to have to wait around and see what happens.
171548,3,"The Nyko intercooler TS is the long awaited cooler to finally put rest to the problems of the past (draining power from the console), but it falls short of delivering the ultimate solution.  For people in warm to hot climates (Caribbean) like me, the problem of the Xbox 360 overheating is very serious, as i can testify that my first one went the way of the RROD, even with a fan next to it.

  Nyko's new product does works as advertised, it gets some hot air out, but to my surprise it does have a mixed effect on the console performance.  While playing Gears of War i noticed that the intercooler caused some noticeable lag that was not present before.  In my opinion it is because the fans are under powered (low RPM) and to that you add that the intercooler blocks the original fans exhaust, resulting in a half way solution, or increased problems.

  What i am doing now is a combination of two imperfect products:
The Intec Cooling Station(a cool base with a fan) + the nyko intercooler TS =
the results are great, the game disc comes out at room temperature, and the console performs as good as ever (note that there is no air conditioning in the room).

  My recommendation is that if overheating is a serious trouble for you, don't rely in just one product to solve it.

*****Edit  Dec 6 2008******

Almost a month later the intercooler is working great.  excellent purchase for any xbox 360 player

***2nd Edit  Feb 3 2009****

As stated in the first two paragraph, the intercooler performs as advertised, but beware.  IF you plan to use your 360 in the HORIZONTAL position, this product might not be enough.  Given to the limited space inside the console, the motherboard and all computing components are sitting below the DVD drive.  In the horizontal position the heat is not dissipated and therefore it stays concentrated between the 360 and the tv table, very problematic scenario.  My solution was to get one of those laptop cooling fans and use it for the 360.  Its compact enough and it looks decent.  Just remember that the 360 is n
known to have heat issues, take the necessary measures to prolong the life of your console."

231607,3,"This game is good but need more contest and maps, four multiplayer modes extend the fairly short campaign, The graphics look fine, with pretty good character models"
113009,3,"Although in no ways is it a MW2 killer. This is a good decent military shooter and a lot of fun.

The multiplayer has only 8 maps at launch. But the action is pretty intense. If you are familiar with battlefield bad company, then this is pretty much similar. Ribbons and awards are given for accomplishing nice little daring feats. Up to 25 players can play in multiplayer match so it does feel like an actual battle indeed. Different modes include everything from the classic team deathmatch. To capturing sectors and blowing up certain objectives. The great thing about multiplayer is it's realism. You don't have to empty a clip on a enemy just to kill them like in Halo Reach or Modern Warfare 2. The maps although their are only eight of them, aren't to massive or to small. But their are certain choke points that you will find yourself in, especially during the objective based modes.

Single player is not as good. The campaign is short. You will probably complete it in only 5-6 hours of play time. The AI is pretty easy. I only died once time in the first mission. Unless you charge in front of a machine gun or get to close to a bunch of enemies, you won't die often. If you want a challenge, play this game on the hardness difficulty. Your team mates are not that much better when it comes to AI. They have a bad habit of getting in front of you while your shooting, causing you to hit your buddy and not the enemy.

The sound and graphics are perfect. This is a game to play with the surround sound cranked up. Gunfire sounds and explosions sound very realistic along with shouts and curses from both enemies and friendly. The game does a great job in emerging you into combat. Graphics are also pretty good with showing off nice texture of mountains, dirty villages and cold weather. Although in some areas it looks a little grainy, especially in the large areas.

EDIT- Having played this game even more i can say that the multiplayer is broken. Sniper rifles are god in multiplayer and one shot ANYWHERE kills the enemy. Spawn camping is the worst i seen in any FPS game, it's really bad in the objective based games where you spawn on a particular team mate rather then in an area like in COD. The graphics in both single and multi are bland and lack attention to detail and even some texture, maybe the PC version looks better. I would wait to get COD black ops before trying this game"
247448,3,The songs in this game were just ok. I was told the songs in the other just dances were much better.
57991,3,"By now it goes without saying that GR2 bears little resemblance to the original incarnation of the game, or even the console ports of it.  It's really less a sequel and more a Rainbow 6: Black Arrow, for Ghost Recon. Which is to say: a game that's acceptably faithful to the original but clearly engineered for consoles rather than the PC.

The core design isn't really the problem with this game as, for the most part, it plays pretty well and still manages to convey an authentic GR experience; even if it does lack some of the finer points. Unfortunately as with Black Arrow, your squadmates are pretty much fixed so there's no element of strategy to the pre-game aside from picking your own loadout. Multiplayer options abound and I think the only thing I found lacking about the off-campaign missions was the inability to run a Firefight with a squad to back you up or to use something besides US weaponry in general. It seems the only place you get to play with the foreign hardware is in the true multiplayer modes.

While I was initially quite disappointed to see how stripped down GR2 ended up being in general, it works, so I can't objectively count that against it. With that aside there ultimately ends up being a good number of other things beneath the surface that serve to hinder overall enjoyment.

If you've played the original GR you can vouch for the fact that your squadmates were often the first to pick out and gun down enemies, more often than not before you even knew they were there. It seems that your new squad of ghosts are a bit on the nearsighted side as they generally end up doing exactly the opposite. Compound this with some occasionally schitzophrenic pathfinding and you have a recipe for annoyance. Teammates who randomly run across your field of fire, take cover behind something that occludes their shot of an enemy, or... just not shooting at them at all. The AI commands are pretty limited and none seem to be especially useful aside from ""surpress"". Telling your mates to flank often just sends them off wandering in a random direction and ""hold"" seems to wear off by itself and send your little buddies hurrying off to find where ever you've gone in their absence.  As a side note, ""hold fire"" strikes me as almost entirely useless due to the fact that any element of stealth within the game is all but broken and works on only the most basic of levels.

Your opposition on the other hand seems to have no problem finding cover, falling back and repositioning to get the drop on you. The enemy AI isn't brilliant, but its enough to be challenging without a few of the game's more annoying mechanics backing them up. First of these is the fact that enemies will indeed spawn out of thin air. You think you've cleared the area behind you on the way to an objective? Well, you probably did, but now there is inexplicably a hail of bullets comming from that direction.  Now make no mistake, the original GR -did- do things like this on occasion but in GR2 it seems to be much more of a staple, or thorn, to the point that its readilly noticable and becomes expected that you can pretty much never safely turn your back. Somewhat in line with this is the fact that when enemies -do- start crawling out of the woodwork (and I don't mean on missions where they're supposed to) they tend to do so in mass numbers.  Even in its stripped down form, GR is still not well suited as a by-the-numbers shooter; especially when you have half-braindead AI backing you up.

The mission design is superficially pretty well-varied but alot of the missions end up boiling down to, ""go here and protect this from 100 enemies that are swarming out of the treeline"".  The new ""Defend"" mode is built around this idea but there are also a few others which place you in the same position. Some of the maps are more linear than others, though once you take into account the randomly spawn-reinforced opposition you may come to appreciate them more than the wider open ones where you're more or less a sitting duck waiting to be ambushed from an area you just cleared out.

The only real ""enhancement"" to the game, also exacerbates one of its most annoying quirks.  The M29 (and that other one, I can't think of right now) are pretty neat little toys that can make it feel more like you're playing Kill.switch than Ghost Recon 2, but they're not without their downside.  Though it seems to be more of an issue when using 3rd person, the problem can also crop up in 1st person as well.  Your launched grenades (this does apply to any underslung grenade launcher, its just more problematic with the unique aiming of the IWS rifles) seem to have a really large collision box.  This basically means that its really easy to unwittingly grenade yourself in the face when behind cover.

I think that's enough ranting so in summary: GR2 could've ultimately been a solid, if stripped down and somewhat halfhearted ""sequel"", but there's alot of little things counting against it that could be grounds for a good ammount of frustration."
25668,3,"Well, In Japan, this game is galled tales of Eternai. It was only when it was brought state-side that the name changed to become Tales of Destiny II.Like its' previous installment, this game was released for the original Playstation video game console.

Graphics: Well, not so much different than the first game, this game also uses sprite graphics similar to the previous game. But, the quality has been upgraded.

Characters are very expressive and are nice to get to know, as each one again has their own history and background, just like all the Tales series games have.

The game has a couple of cutscenes, which make it stand out a little bit more for its time period.

Game play: You have limited control over the characters, but you can make them walk, run, or jump how you want them to be able and do.

This game uses the technique attacks. But, the TP will not replenish itself alone. You actually need to be able and use a gel to help you restore the TP.

The main character this time, can use more than one main weapon. One of such weapons, would be a nice axe. Depending on your predicament, and what style of fighting you like, you can choose the weapon.

A nice thing this time, is that you can and will be able to save your game in the middle of dungeons. Which, I personally found was a very nice and handy feature.

Story: a nice Tales storyline. I will not spoil it here.
It is the basic ""save the world"" again. Which almost all RPG games have now. But, at the time, it was something new and very fun and entertaining!"
244661,3,"The title says it all. I played on normal difficulty (although I wanted to turn it to easy so many times) and died SO many times, often in the same spot OVER AND OVER again. This is by all accounts a trial and error based game; that didn't work? Dead. Oh, let's try this.. nope, dead. Maybe i'll try thi-NOPE. dead. There are a lot of ""cheap"" deaths where you will turn a corner and just die in one hit, or fall off something unintentionally and die. This is by no means a BAD game, the sci-fi look and feel is great and I am a fan of sci-fi. FYI i've been gaming faithfully since I was around 5-6 years old to get some background on me, and I played Halo on the original Xbox when it came out, but don't remember much from it. I am going to find a way to trade this game in somewhere because I have no intentions of ever torturing myself with this game ever again"
453459,3,"I rented this game because of how much I liked previous NHL games made by EA Sports.  So I picked this up and poped it in.  The first thing I noticed was that there were a lot of little movies.  Players getting pumped up before a game, celebrations on and off the ice.  I thought that was pretty cool, and a new added feature.  But other than little things like that, this game doesn't offer much of anything new. Here's what I thought about this game, and why I only thought it a renter, not a buyer.
1. The graphics: The players are sharper, the ice is thicker.  The fans actually move in 3D!  But overall, not to great.  The puck is way too big, and the overall graphics just aren't to improved.  This game had great graphics, but so did previous versions.
2. The options: HORRIBLE.  No create a team, no new features.  And the biggest thing, no FRANCHISE mode!  That was about as dumb as having no franchise mode in NBA Live 2001.  I am seriously disapointed by the options in this game.  Nothing new whatsoever!
3. The overall depth: After your first season, this game will probably get pretty boring.  More new features and better graphics is what this game needs.  I hope EA changed things in 2003 edition.  Oops, too bad!  They did the same thing.  Until they finally add some sort of franchise and stuff like that, EA's NHL series will continue, for me, to be a renter, not a buyer.  Rent before u buy, then make your decision.  Just a warning.
Hope this helped, and I expect a lot more from the great company that is EA.  Thx!"
475139,3,"Ok to start off this I would have given this game a 4 star or maybe a 5 star if not for the the bad controls it has . The jumping is horrible and that is bad because this game is a platforming game , with that said Prinny game is very unforgiving and at times its frustrating and challenging but not in a good way , challenging as in keep your calm through all those unfair deaths and bad jumping because of bad controllers that lead you to dying A LOT .

With all that said Prinny still very cute and has an adorable story much like DIsgea good voice work and the 2D graphics are cute and the levels are very well done along with the enemy their all well done . SO if you can get pass the frustrating controls and bad platforming this game has something to offer its not bad but it has its charms .

Even with me wanting to trough my psp against the wall because of this game I still couldn't put it down to finish the story . A 3 star is fair no more no less ."
306602,3,"This is an interesting game, but only up to the real level cap of 20.  After that the game becomes a heavy grind, with no way to get any higher in level unless you get lucky with a very rare armor drop which has the light stat in it.  Your forced into grouping, doing the same zones over and over again.

The game world is much smaller than I would have expected for a company that supposedly put so much money into this."
101474,3,"Mortal Kombat had a strong start in the early-to-mid 90s, and died in the same decade before being revived in the 2000s with Deadly Alliance and its sequels. This game was a clear response from Midway to their fanbase as a type of apology for the game ""Mortal Kombat Advance"", a port of the SNES version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3... actually port is a misleading term. Mortal Kombat Advance was a horrifically butchered technological bomb and it's a shining example of why games should be quality tested over and over before being released.

But now, Midway says ""I'm sorry"" with this game, which I take to be somewhat of a loveletter to fans of the classic franchise, and especially of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. The game is a direct port of the ARCADE VERSION of Ultimate MK3, and even keeps the Kombat Kodes along with allowing you to unlock all three of the hidden characters--Ermac, Mileena and Classic Sub-Zero! Now at first I thought it was such a waste of time for them to do that, but it actually gives you a reason to play through the game. Personally the gameplay to me feels exactly like any console port of it, and I'm especially satisfied with the button layout. The addition of MK Deception's Puzzle Kombat is a refreshing break from the fighting genre in case you bore, and you can even access endings, bios, and credits in the menu! It keeps track of your wins and losses against oppponents and multiplayer is a definitive possibility. (Horray)

Now here's where it gets muggy. I'm going to start with the small complaints and work my way up to the bigger issues with this game.

First of all, the bottom screen is pretty much unused for the most part. During a match it shows you the fatalities and moves for every character. Isn't that nice? BUT IT ONLY TELLS YOU THE BUTTON COMBOS. You still need to figure out distance on your own, as well as assume you're always starting out on the left. That's right, if you're on the right side of your opponent and you type in the code as you see it, you have a high chance of mixing up left with right and screwing up the move or finisher. It's happened to me dozens of times. So you just have to practice and rely on good old fashioned memory to get the job done.

Secondly, the enemy AI. This isn't a very bad thing, as the game has manageable difficulty for the first couple of enemies and then gets increasingly more difficult. But they ported this DIRECTLY FROM THE ARCADE. So expect some REALLY tough battles whenever you get up that ladder. And if you're new to this game, all I can tell you is practice, practice, practice. Or just give up.

Third of all, the graphics. I'm not usually one to judge a game by its graphics, but this game does something strange. I figure they had to scrunch up the sprites to make them fit on the DS's top screen or bottom, if you had set it as your main fight screen, so what you're essentially left with is sprites that look unusually skinny and heavily pixelated. Now some don't look bad. In fact during gameplay you're not going to really notice and care about the sprite appearances but if you're going for arcade quality then the DS really does somewhat rob it. HOWEVER if you're playing on an XL system (such as the DSi XL or the 3DS XL) then the graphics are stretched--still pixelated, but it looks better. Like you're playing an actual arcade but without the joystick and a fistful of quarters!

And lastly, and this is really my final gripe about the game... The action is fast, and most DS systems are way too small to allow you to move quickly enough when your hands get cramped. But that's really Nintendo's fault, if anyone's. So it's advised to take a break whenever your hands get tired. Trust me, you'll need to.

Overall the gameplay and sound win the game over for me in this. I only gave it three stars because justifying a purchase depends on whether or not you want to play Ultimate MK3. So here's my verdict: Play it if you want to play UMK3 the way it was meant to be played. Otherwise your only option for handheld Kombat is either a GBA and MK Advance, or a PSP and Midway Arcade Treasures... which unfortunately isn't compatible with the PS Vita. So yes, I'd say get it and play it whenever you get the urge to play some REAL Mortal Kombat!"
13315,3,This is the second installment of Who Whant To Be A Millionare. And it it is better in many ways. First of all I see the creators have found their mistake in the 1st edition so they added a ton of question so that it will probally won't repeat.  They also have improved the graphics Regis looks better. But this game still has its flaws. For one the questions are to hard I still haven't won the million. Regis still says the same thing over and over. They still didn't do anything to improve the lifelines. And you still can't get around that intro which takes for ever. Also they didn't even try to do anything with the fastest finger. I still don't recommend this but you might want to give it a try.

121601,3,"I really wanted to love this game.  I reserved it and picked it up the first day.  But, I've played it and I found it to be a huge disappointment.  It does have merit.  Visually it's great.  The story is awesome, as are the characters.  It's bloody, rude, and crude.  But, when it comes down to it, the gameplay is just plan boring.  There is very little challenge and almost all the enemies look the same.  You push the A button to swing and then it goes into a finishing move where you have to swing the remote in the direction of the arrow on the screen.  This is all great fun, until you realize it doesn't really matter which way you wave the remote.  You just waggle it, like so many other Wii games and you'll get your finishing move pretty much every time.  Then for getting to missions it makes you drive around GTA style, but there is nothing interesting to do in the city.  You just drive from place to place and it is completely pointless and boring.  The game is worth a rental, but I can't see any reason to buy this game.  The reviewers got this one wrong, the game is fun to look at, but overall it gets boring quick.  A real bummer."
191299,3,"I played the first Magna Carta and couldn't get through it. It was just stupid. For this game, I actually liked it.

The battle mechanics is great. I really enjoyed it and it's what kept me interested. Battles are real-time. You have characters who build up points for attack and are attack types or those who build up points for attack and are magic types. To build up points, you have to use regular attacked and as the points build up you can use special attacks.

You increase attack power and get more skills by using the points you get when you level up to max out the branch for each weapon. Each character gets two different types of weapons (one ranged and one melee; except, for the attack types), each with its own branch. So you can choose whether, for the magic types, you want a ranged or melee character. Leveling up the weapon branch can be a bit tedious, because it's rather hard to level up in general. You will have to go around the field and fight monsters over and over again to level up. You can also gain exp. points from missions.

The monsters on change all that much. They change in color and level. If you are fighting a monster that is lvl. 50, as you keep fighting that monster and gain levels, there is a diminishing return on each level you gain. The more levels you have the fewer experience points you will get. And in the final dungeon, the monsters are only around lvl. 72 or 75 (I can't remember). So to get to lvl. 80 will take some work.

The acting isn't great (some characters are better than others), but the story, I think, is good enough to squirm your way through the bad acting. I didn't watch the final scenes, because the bad acting got to me. You know that the main male character will fall for the main female character and it's annoying. Before, when they were friends, it was a good game. The main male character becomes very self-righteous and no matter what the cost wants to save the female character, which is a plot line that chapped my hide something fierce. Then there is one female character, with the high pitched voice, who acts like she injects caffeine into her blood. There is one stoic older male character, and one sarcastic younger guys. The usual list of suspects; however, even though I expect this, some games give these character more dimension and depth, which this game didn't do.

You will do a variety of mission (68 or 75, I believe), which will net you money, experience and sometimes items (weapons, attack/heal items, etc). Only two characters can heal (the two female characters). The main female character is more useful at healing then the ditsy girl, which sucks because unless you want to keep using items, you will always need one of them in your party.

Your party can be changed at any point in the game, even while battling. The battle difficulty is good, with some battles more difficult than others. There are few puzzles (the final dungeon is where you will be hit with the most puzzles; it's a series of small, but annoying puzzles).

The battle mechanics is what kept me playing. Also, on a side not, the environment isn't rich colors; it looks a bit drained in color. The graphics aren't FF good, but they're good enough. For the battles, the one annoying thing is the seemingly long ""movie"" before the actual attack. The price of items increase sharply. If you understand the mechanics of the game, it's not that hard, but if you don't, it can be a challenge.

Did I enjoy this game? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes. It's not memorable, but not forgettable either. It's way way way better than the first, though."
284070,3,"I have to say that SquidGrip is really amazing at providing grip and although the feeling of using them is quite strange for the first few days, this goes away and it becomes quite effortless.

Unfortunately, after about a month of daily use the adhesive begins to wear off, dirt and grime slip underneath the pads, and then you've got peeling bits of annoying foam all over your controller.

Pro: excellent true-to-form grip that feels natural and doesn't interrupt any controller motion or button-presses.

Con: adhesive will rub off after a few weeks and make the product relatively useless. You can super-glue it back on, but then you can never ever remove it... so that's a choice you'll need to make for yourself. I like the grip so much I may end up doing this, but I don't want that to be the default life-long route for ownership for this product. And if you failed to properly apply the adhesive in the first place by washing the controller and drying it to prevent the oils from your hands from getting in the way, then I can assure you that the adhesive will last much less time than mine."
74301,3,"In PDZ, you take up arms as Joanna Dark once more, except this time as a teenager and a bounty hunter with her pops Jack Dark. Once her father is killed by the evil corporation of dataDYNE on a mission, and a conspiracy begins to unfold around the same company, Joanna teams up with Carrington Institute to try and topple dataDyne...and to avenge her dad's death as well.

You see the world through Joanna's eyes as she runs around blowing away enemies with an assortment of weapons including a shotgun, the Superdragon, a ""Shockwave"" sniper rifle (remember the FarSight in the 64 game? Well this is the equivelent of it), the DY .357 magnum, and many more. You get to use turrets, hover crafts, and this mechanical walker thing with an M60 on it so that was cool too. You can use ziplines to get from one building to the next, and you can even press up against walls for cover and precise firing.

Lets talk a difference between this title and it's masterpiece of a predessor on the Nintendo 64. For starters, in Zero before you can do a stage you have to select your weapons and make sure you have enough space in the item slots for it. So in essence, you could really only carry one assault rifle and one SMG. That is VERY lame in my opinion - I don't play a first person shooter to manage inventory. Moving on, in order to unlock new weapons - say a CMP150 SMG that wasn't in your beginning inventory -for use in other stages, you must complete that level while having the CMP150 as one of your current weapons; WHICH means you must toss a weapon, take the CMP, and beat the level with it to have it for further use. Another lame idea. So if you are currently wondering, yes I am missing a bunch of weapons in my inventory. However, Perfect Dark 64 didn't have any of this and equaled out for a much better experience.

The multiplayer is somewhat redeeming, but still no match for PD64. You choose a level, how big it is, your weapon set, character/team, bots, and gametype and go at it. There are some interesting games like Infection or Hacking, but it's been done before. However, this game pretty much took out the in-depth character & bot customization process the 64 version had as well as being able to command your team, and in turn, lost a lot of points and was almost lackluster. Furthermore, you must actually beat the game to unlock all the bots, teams, and characters to get the most of the multiplayer - ahem, LAME!. However, it will still provide you with some fun if you and a couple of your friends are looking to just blow each other or some bots away. There is also a Co-Op mode which was pretty fun I'll admit.

I'm forced to admit, but this is the best looking game I have ever seen. Everything looks incredibly realistic, the lighting is superb, the characters look humanlike and move as fluid as one as well. The enviroments, be it vast jungles, dense cities, or huge mansions are truley breathtaking. Perfect Dark Zero definitley showed the power of the X-Box 360, and really set the standard for future games. HOWWWWWWWEVER, and this was inevitable to avoid on this review, was the fact that I despise what they did with Joanna Dark's look. She was never a punk rock chick, nor was she a supermodel - she was grotesque in the 64, she was british, she was something that could pass off as a secret agent... sigh, why Rare, why?

The music has it's ups and downs. Some songs, like when you are..grr..managing your inventory..are techno-esk and remind me of the glory days of PD64. Then there are the heavy metal / rock sections which help you get pumped up for a big battle. Then, there are the actual rave tunes which truley ruined it all for me. It was ridiculous and didn't help the overall atmosphere of the game at all. The voice acting was good for the most part, except Jack Dark who was just annoying.

The ending was flat out bad, but from what I have seen recently, most games are. You destroy the main villian/CEO of dataDYNE (can't remember his name at the moment) who underwent some transformation and became something that reminded me of a Dragon Ball Z character with the kamahamaha blasts and super strength. Anyway, you kill him, and officially join Carrington Institute - hence setting the stage for Perfect Dark 64... not worth it in the least bit.

And I'm not going to lie - this game is hard, and then incredibly harder on other parts such as the Jungle stage. The good news? It's short, with a mere 13 missions.

With all the hype surrounding this game, and with the memory of how awesome the first game was, I'm actually really dissapointed in the overall experience I had. Perfect Dark Zero had it's moments of decently intense firefights and pretty good multiplayer, but for the most part it was just a run of the mill FPS - albeit with excellent graphics. I suggest a rental, nothing more.

...Also, in the club mission, if you look around at the videos on the wall...they are the from Windows Media Player. It was Microsoft's own little plug, just like in Condemned."
56621,3,"Predator looks out of place in this game. The Predator himself looks great & has a huge amount abilites & weapons & different sight visions. The way the Predator jumps up to buildings & has some realy nice weapons to use & alot of different combos.  While the Predator looks realy good & detailed ,the people on the street look cartoonish & a little like people in the first spiderman game. And the missions are ok but they're kinda on the kiddie side. It just felt like the Predator belongs in a cooler darker and more detailed enviroment & sharper detailed enemies. The Predator does have some great moves and alot of good weapons but he's just out of place in this game. The Predator  himself deserves about 4.2 stars but the buildings and textures and the goofy looking people seem like there better suited for a kiddie game. 3 stars for the whole package."
453408,3,I really enjoyed it.
37879,3,"Rewrote this review after playing a couple of months.  This game is a lot of fun:  The graphics are great, the online play is better that others cause of the level of graphics and weapons choices.  Can't switch weapons while playing multi-player, but the best time to change weapons, if you want to, is after you've died in a match and your waiting for the next round to start, press tab.
Single player is fun, but your teammate bots are dummer than Ghost Recon bots if that tells you anything.  The enemy bots are too smart sometimes though( they still do an occasional really dumb things)--they will shoot you from a way far away when it seems impossible that they would even know you were even there...jokingly, the bots should have a higher amount of FF casualties since they normally shoot you with just your head peeping around a corner.
You'll hear the same enemy comments too many times to in single player, ""hello"", ""what was that"", ""that was odd"", I'm getting out of here"", ""I need help"".  Might've been funny if the enemy bots had of used more colorful comments."
72420,3,"This is a really fun game to play. You can plunder gold, take over towns, take on pirates, dance with girls and get your family back. And then retire fat and rich."
325367,3,"So, the top/bottom Pink Panels have obviously been applied or removed for some reason. There was a hairline crack on one of the hinges. Other than that the device plays great, no internal damage to be found. Arrived fast and hasn't shown any sign of ""failure"" from a technical stand-point. Was used and showed it but the device was definitely reset to factory defaults before it arrived. Naturally it took a good while to update and setup like normal but it's not given any problems so far."
33961,3,"I love this game. I also hate this game. The game play is great and your abilities to really customize your mechs is fantastic. I am a nit picker and one the appealing, yet also frustrating parts of this game is building and customizing the mechs. It really made me mad trying to put together the three best possible mechs I could. In some cases you could spend top dollar on every part and get a mech that was rated fair or just good. Other times you could vary between cheap and moderate and get an excellent or great rated mech. There was a stratagy building my mechs that made it fun. I gave this game only three stars because of graphics. Usually graphics don't mean that much to me, but this is a PS2 game and the main play graphics look like they belong on the PS1. It was very distracting for me. Solid game play, but poor graphics. I recomend renting this one first."

90513,3,"I just picked up a PSP Daxter bundle, with five more games (not including the game with the bundle), including this one.  I was eager for some FPS WWII action and some godd multiplayer on the go.  Sadly, this game doesn't rise above average.

First, let me start with the controls.  This is how to do a FPS on the PSP.  One uses the X, O, triangle, and square buttons to look around and the analog stick to move.  The shoulder buttons are for zooming and shooting, and the d-pad is used to use medkits, reload, and cycle weapons.  As you can see, every button is used to the fullest, and there is little room to do anything in the game but shoot Germans.  Most of the missions involve capturing a post or picking up some secret plans, and then escaping.  It would get repetitive, except for the fact that the game doesn't even last long enough to do that.  I was on veteran (medium) difficulty and the game lasted 3-4 hours.  Even on hero difficulty, it took less than six hours.  It's not that the missions aren't difficult, but that they are too short.  The longest one took was about fifteen minutes, and there were a couple I beat in three, leaving me with a sense of wanting much more.  Your squadmates will constantly throw grenades and hit you, and with only one medkit, some of the missions would depend on finding another health pack.

Now, I have been a bit critical.  However, there are many good aspects to the game.  First is the controls.  The shooting controls are tight and frantic, even on a handheld.  They may take a bit to get used to, but they work extremely well once you do.  The graphics are also very good for a handheld, probably in the line of late PSone, early PS2 games.  The colors are bright, but it's hard to enjoy them when you've faced the same generic forest, snow, and open plain levels in other, better WWII FPS games.  The multiplayer also holds up very well, and is extremely easy to set up.  It would be tons of fun, but, sadly, few people are ever signed on.

All in all, it turned out to be only decent.  It rehashed many themes done in previous games of the like, but it did rehash them pretty well, and provides some good shooter action on the go.  Don't go in expecting too much, and you may want to pick this one up on the bargain rack."
88842,3,We thought this would be a multi-player multigame and bought it for that reason. It does have some multiplayer modes you can unlock but we wanted it for a party game. Overall it's challenging enough and pretty fun but we will be buying Raving Rabbids 2 since we really want full multiplayer mini games.
255665,3,good tool
56447,3,"As a major fan of Front Mission 3 for the PlayStation I was excited upon hearing the news that Square-Enix was making a sequel to my favorite single-player tactical-strategy game.  The only thing missing from Front Mission 3's excellence was great graphics.  With the arrival of Front Mission 4 on the PlayStation2 I thought the rough-graphics problem would be solved and I'd have the perfect game.
Unfortunately life has a way of playing dirty tricks.  Oh sure, the graphics are much improved over FM3 with greater detail and far smoother animation.  But the colors are downright bland!  Also, many areas in the game appear overly dark, making it a challenge to view the screen easily unless the lights are off.  I suspect the developers were going for realism here.
The length of the game disappointed me as well.  For the amount of time spent working on your characters' skills and statistics the number of actual plot-developing missions is minuscule.  There are only 29 stages in all!  By comparison, FM3 contained a staggering 128 stages played out through two scenarios!  Admittedly, FM4's stages are bigger and take longer to complete, and there are simulator battles to play.  But FM3 had simulator battles, too!
Now that the bad is out of the way let me let you what was good about FM4:
Graphics - already touched on this.  MUCH better than FM3 except for the colors & lack of lighting.
Sound - the most refined part of FM4.  Heavy, realistic, perfect.  Great use of bass!
Music - very appropriate for the events onscreen.  High quality.
Speech - the main characters now speak in select cut scenes and the voice-overs are extremely well done.  The accents and voice tones are very accurate to their respective nationalities.  No bad acting here!
Battle System - more involved than in the last game.  The Link system adds a fun new level of strategy to the gameplay.  New specialized backpacks increase combat options.
Customization - a slight increase in variety of weapons and parts.  Better colorization options but the blandness + darkness at times makes it almost moot.
Control - takes some getting used to, but adequate.  In a tactical, non-twitch game like this it's not a detriment.
Battle Maps - daytime shifting and weather effects add new depth to missions.  Battlefields are significantly larger than in FM3.
Character Skills - no more randomness in acquiring new battle skills to help towards victory!  Instead characters buy skills they want as they become available!  The challenge is getting the funds needed to afford them.
And finally, FM4's greatest improvement over FM3...the chaotic E-mail/virtual net system is gone!
I'd have to say FM4 doesn't match the gaming experience FM3 gave.  Don't get me wrong...it's a fantastic game for as long as it lasts.  The plot is solid.  Just don't expect as huge a jump in quality as I did or you'll be disappointed."
181790,3,"Make sure you get the US version, not some weird Singapore/Malaysia/etc region-based one. I had mine returned because the Singapore one didn't support wifi or something"
407517,3,"We found more fun songs on this version than the 2015 version.  However, we would like to see more in the store (upon release there was no store for buying songs?).  Also, although Just Dance 2016 recognized that we had all the prior versions of Just Dance, all we got extra was a few additional icons/badges.  Game's navigation with Kinect still isn't that smooth, unlike Dance Central.  Needs more hip hop!"
399791,3,"This game offers updated graphics and mechanics to the original game set. As some reviewers already mentioned, this game plays more like a puzzle determining the way the developers wanted the hit to be performed than as a free flowing, multiple option game as in the past. The checkpoints in this game are not that bad in that you can usually obtain one after getting by some obstacles, but I prefer being able to save a game anywhere.

The game menu is a little funky allowing you to go to any mission that you already completed. The intent here I suppose is to cater to the online contracts a little easier.

The game's storyline is a little lame. It does seem like you spend a lot of time avoiding cops instead of doing contracts. There is also more emphasis on blending in and button control in hand to hand combat and multiple target shooting (the shooting range).

The game controls do work pretty well and I did not have any problems with the game in lag or crashing.

There is the emphasis to play the game missions again, as contracts, online. This involves a player choosing multiple targets or different targets, with a specific or any weapon, and method of escape. Players performing these hits get points and these values are displayed globally. This would appeal to anybody that like leaderboard games.

I played this game twice and decided to trade it in afterwords. It took me about a week to play the game averaging about 3 hours a day."
304757,3,"Like the game says, it is a driving simulator, not a racing game.... But you race, to make money and to buy cars, rinse lather repeat.

In the beginning, before patch 1.02, money was extremely hard to come by, and buying cars was difficult. But, PD listened and gave us some online races like GT5.

There are some pros and cons to the game. Mind you I haven't got my wheel yet (Logitech G27, Merry Christmas to me), so driving is done currently with a DS3.

Pros-

New and enhanced suspension and tire modeling
 - gives the cars a more realistic feeling especially when pushing to the limit.
 - slightly better sounds (tires, helps with knowing how hard you are pushing the car)
 - more tracks
 - a few new cars (not all are amazing as they lead)
 - better lighting in game
 - more custimizations (wheels)
 - better menu
 - so far the online races, aren't races, but rather single player time trial with friend lines.

Cons

 - all in game races are chase the rabbit. (start in last or close to last and have 2-5 laps to catch and pass first)
 - AI drivers are really bad. They tend to brake really late, doing endo's, crash into you every chance they get, spin you out when ever possible, oh and the rabbit in later races (ib, ia) will draft you and crash into you.
 - Odd how when finishing a race, you care within maybe 2-3 seconds ahead of 2nd place but a minute ahead of 5th-whatever
 - still no livery, but understand some of the reasons why.

Waiting for the elusive track editor.

All in all, a very fun and addicting game, frustrating at times, but if you enjoy driving real life road cars, and some super, its the way to go.

Will update when the wheel arrives and when more patches come....

Update 11/16/14:
Patch 1.13
So we've gotten a few new cars, and a few new tracks. I have been playing with a Logitech G27 since the middle of January 2014.
I will say that they (PD) keep changing the basics. They are always doing something without telling us, sometimes they do tell us. Physics seem to change nearly every update; this is frustrating because it means a re-tune on dozens of cars. And of course they don't tell us what changed, so it is hours of trial and error figuring out how to fix the cars.
The AI has been through many changes, some good, some not so good.
Online play (not the players) is hit and miss. Constant dropping from the lobby, inconsistent physics (car takes the corner just fine one lap, feels like on ice on another). Taking smoke away from some tracks in online. Chat function is spotty, works fine in other games with the same people. Severe glitching on the track, players can't see all the cars, cars jump all over.
Career mode is rather short and somewhat boring, online is the only place to have any fun and set up the races the way you want to.

It still is a fun game to grab any of the cars and fly around a track and to BS with friends, but I am saving up the money for a new PC to get a better ""sim"" experience."

126130,3,This is a good game but I find it difficult to maneuever through some parts and I get annoyed trying to figure out a trick to jump something or clime something.  If that is you cup of tea you would probably really like this game.  The graphics are great and the fighing is fun but can also be a bit annoying due to the steps you have to take to defeat the larger monsters.
44688,3,"When it was first released for the Super NES in 1994, ""Donkey Kong Country"" set the world on fire.  Astonshing ACM graphics, stereo sound, awesome music, and just plain FUN gameplay quickly made it one of the best-selling platform action games of all time.  It later spawned two sequels, plus a 3-D version for the Nintendo 64, and each sequel got progressively better as the years went by.
Now we have the convenient travel size version of the adventures of Donkey and Diddy.  We have all the same unique levels, heroic Kongs, cute animal buddies, evil Kremlings, and other all-too-familiar enemy creatures.  The graphics are not nearly as detailed as they are on the SNES version, but the backgrounds are still beautiful and the landscape of the levels still shows a lot of the original drawing (especially the levels in ""Gorilla Glacier""); and the sound is not nearly as crisp, but players can still tell how catchy the tunes are and how well they fit each scenario.  (Who could forget the all-time classic jungle music, or bonus area music?)
Of course, this is all expected when you make a portable version of one of the greatest games ever.  Unfortunately, there is a major flaw with this portable game: even with all the original levels, the game is now way too easy.  Much, much, much easier than the original game ever was.
One of the silliest new features added to this game is that when you save your game, you save the number of lives you have as well.  This is especially dumb when you take in the new Mini-game features: six difficulty levels each of a fishing game and a dancing game.  If you've played ""Dance Dance Revolution"" before, you should be able to win 3 extra lives every time you play any level on the dancing game; if not, keep trying, there are no rhythms harder than quarter notes.  Fishing is just dropping a hook into the sea and trying to catch the right types of fish; you don't even have to try to reel in the fish since the game automatically does it for you.  The only level on the fishing game that I didn't beat on my first try was the ""Gorilla Glacier"" one, where you had to catch 50 jellyfish in the allotted time.
Also, you are allowed to call Funky's Flights anywhere you want, so you can go back and play easy levels to get tons of extra lives there.  This works even if you haven't found Funky in the hardest area you reached, so you basically go and get tons of extra lives any time you want even if the mini-games bore you to tears.
Another easy way to repeatedly get extra lives is with Golden Animal tokens; every time you get three, you can enter a bonus area where you get another life for every 100 little tokens you collect (my record: 1138 in the Expresso one).  You could do this as often as you wanted in the original too, but this game saves your tokens, so you often start the game with two of one type of token, and then you may end up going to the corresponding bonus area without even planning on it.
But no matter how you play, you'll find it really easy to keep winning lives over and over again.  You'll be up to 99 lives before you know it.  Although the game does give you a Hero Mode once you've beaten it--where you can only play as Diddy and have no checkpoints in the levels--you still can save your progress with a huge number of lives, so any difficulty added to the levels quickly gets canceled out. (Oh, and one more really stupid addition is that if you've beaten a level, you can do the START+SELECT trick to escape from the level when you die, EVEN IF THE DEATH ANIMATION AND MUSIC HAS ALREADY STARTED, and you still won't lose a life!  It's a really cheap way to save yourself from losing lives when you don't have to.)
But apart from being able to survive infinitely, there is an even bigger problem regarding difficulty; the difficulty of finding all the secrets has been significantly diminished as well.  One of the best features of the original game was that there were tons of bonus areas full of great items.  The easiest ones to find were hidden in doors that had to be broken with a barrel, but the more secretive ones were in barrels that were hidden off the screen, and often players had to risk jumping into oblivion in hopes of finding a hidden bonus area.  The portable game has flattened and shrunk the screen down to an uncomfortable size, and now the ""hidden"" bonus barrels are often in plain view!  There's no more fun in trying to find the ""hidden"" bonus areas, because now, you can see them all!  And even if you don't see the *barrel* itself, you often can still see a trail of bananas leading to the barrel, and even these were carefully hidden from view in the original as well.
""Donkey Kong Country"" will always be one of the most brilliant games ever made.  I haven't stopped playing the original game since it first came out.  But I felt like putting down the travel-size version in a month, simply because it had so much fun and challenge taken away that it really didn't do justice to the SNES version.  The game gets 3 stars for remaining faithful to the original with all the same graphics, music, characters, and levels; in fact, this is where the most of the fun in this GBA version comes from.  If Rare hadn't at least done this, I would easily have given the game 2 stars, or possibly even 1."
24386,3,"I almost gave this game 5 stars automatically because it has the words Mario and Kart in it... a shame that it doesn't deserve it.
Of course the graphics are great: SNES graphics on a handheld! No slowdown and very colorful. I liked the questionmark-blocks in the snes-version better though :)
The sound is ok. Nice voices but the music isn't as good as his older brother. It just seems so... uninspired.
And so do the tracks. They are very standard (except for that Indianshyguy-track :) and most important: too easy, even in 150cc. Also the questionmark-blocks keep respawning every few seconds so it's very hard to miss them and you'll blast yourself upto #1 in no time.
If you've won the gold cup in each race you can try to get a star/2 star/3 star-rating (to brag about against yer friends) A 1 starrating is do-able but above that it only gets frustrating: you'll have to pick up all the tiny coins (which are sometimes almost invisible because of the GBA-screen) AND avoid the sand,  - 4 times in a row -
You wanna play the most fun mode in the game, the battlemode with 4 players? Not possible in singleplayer, only available in MULTIPAK-mode. That means that you'll have to find 3 other people with a GBA and Mario Kart. I wish you good luck finding them...
You'll be using the L-button (fire) and R-button (jump) a lot. Be prepared for cramps...
So all in all this game, although it sounds great, just doesn't delivers the charming fun of the SNES-version. I you really wanna play this, have you considered buying the original?"

142412,3,"The game isn't great ... but it's just a trainer, so I wasn't expecting too much.  The game is fun at first, but gets pretty monotonous.  For $19 though, I think it's worth the money for the game and zapper."
355813,3,"Game looks beautiful, plays like farcry 3. There is more wildlife and more encounters with enemies. It is a bit more difficult, which is good. Ran fine for me, once I got past UPlay.

Now this should have been a 5 star review, but it took me over 2 hours to get the UPlay launcher to start. Even b4 I could enter my game code to verify I was a real copy, UPlay was such a DRM Nazi that I will never purchase another UPlay game on PC. It was an absolute chore to get the game started. I mean, it was unreal. UPlay is the WORST. They want to be Steam, but they fail hard.

Once I got past the UPlay fiasco, the game ran just fine. I have a gtx 750ti card, and it looks just fantastic.

My advice, if you have a console, Ubisoft games run well and easy on them....if you have a PC, set aside 2-4 hours of hair pulling, face mashing frustration in getting UPlay set up and started.

And for the game, its a blast, on occasion I did get killed by Rhinos that snuck up on me....would think there should be some rumble on the 360 controller when a Rhino is near, but hey, it is still pretty funny getting assassinated by a giant beast. Oh, and I had to kill 4 Massive Rhinos to craft a wallet, lol. They take like a grenade and 60 Ak rounds to kill. Tough business.

Eagles attack randomly if you are in the open, they are a pain, but if you are quick you can kill them. They are annoying, but they do add an element of danger, especially on towers. I can understand why a lot of people hate em, but I think they are a good addition. They keep you on your toes.

Enemy AI is pretty much the same, and there is some fun new ways to kill and distract em. Avalanches!! Predator bait you can throw at enemies!!!! A lot of fun!

I am not far into the story, it is ok, No-Where near as good as Vaas and part 3, but realistically, you cant follow that. Not to bash any of the actors, they are fine. They did a fine job, its just that are in a serious shadow from part 3. It seems kind of rushed, but that's not so bad, cause it puts you in the game quicker. They seem to know its a clone of 3, and put you in the action w/o too much story.

IN the end, the game IS fun, it IS cool, its just that UPlay sux, and is a royal pain, a stupid hoop to jump through created by a greedy and inept company. Farcry 3 is IMO one of the top 10 all time games......this is a fun follow up...not innovative, but still good."

235092,3,"Dear Infinity Ward,

I just wanted to take this time to thank you for making the best Call of Duty Game ever! Your online multiplayer experience is one of the best! I'm really enjoying the wide variety of guns that all look and feel completely different from one another, but all take the same amount of bullets to put someone down. I didn't want there to be too much difference between the weapon damage in this game, so thank you for that.

I also want to thank you for completely redesigning the maps and straying far away from what Black Ops did with their maps. We all loved the maps in Black Ops, so I think its absolutely brilliant that you strayed far from what they did. No more choke points, plenty of objects to hide behind, lots of 2 story buildings, and the spawn flips when my team goes in to spawn trap... Just awesome... Really good stuff! And the fact that you've done everything in your power to make this the best ""run and gun"" game ever... Just stellar!

Speaking of ""run and gun""... I was really starting to grow tired of the whole strategy thing anyway. So, that thing you did with making 700 different ways to get to an objective (demolition and capture the flag), is just freaking awesome. I mean, forget holding down an objective by playing good defense... No, no... I like the fact that a player on the opposing team can easily get to the objective by literally choosing from hundreds of routes.

Also, since the maps are so small, when I make a kill, and my teammates make a kill, you spawn the other team right around the corner from me, all in the same area. So, now I'm forced into a one versus six situation... Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my awesome killing abilities! It's just brilliant!

Oh, and I know I touched on it before, but I really want to give thanks to the game designer who thought it was necessary to add a bunch of miscellaneous debris in the alley's and streets. Giving my opponents plenty of crap to hide behind... That just really makes my day. I find a lot of joy and happiness in having a player from the opposing team shoot me through the window of a burning car. I hate being able to see who's shooting me, so kudos to whoever thought of that!

Sniper rifles with no recoil!!! I love you guys!!!

I almost forgot... I'm very pleased with the fact that you keep limiting us to 1 attachment for our weapons. I know there's the 2 attachment proficiency perk, but I just hate giving up the other AWESOME proficiency perks to get my rapid fire and much needed silencer. I mean battlefield 3 gives us 3 attachments for every gun without ever having to give up anything, but I mean, that's just really stupid.

I will say though... There are a couple of flaws with this game. As much as it pains me to say it, the whole killstreak rewards system is way wacked. Oh, and the killstreak rewards system... Just terrible.

Other than that, this game is perfect! Nicely Done!"
433723,3,Got this game the day it came out. It's a good pokemon game but I have a few issues with it. I'm not a big fan of the trials replacing the pokemon gyms. It's an interesting idea but it's not my preference. I also dislike the main group of protagonists. The best thing about this game is the new pokemon. They are fun and awesome to battle with.

457236,3,"As Deus Ex was one of the best games ever made, this title pretty much killed the franchise.  Designed with game consoles in mind (which were insanely limited by PC standards of the day) and ""improved"" graphics that were better than the prior title, but looked a tad ""cartoonish,"" what ruins this game is that the ending is definite and often unsatisfying.  It's why Deus Ex: Human Revolution and the newest Deus Ex title are ""prequels.""  There's no way to tell a Deus Ex story beyond this title because all endings bring a conclusive end to the story line.

Dumb move on Edios' part."
118258,3,"Liked most of this keyboard. Keys are nice & sturdy but not too hard to push, really like the feel of the ""WASD keys"" & Space Bar. Big but not that big considering all the extra features on it. Real pain to get the ""C"" keys working but pretty much knew that when I bought it. The real problem for me is the back lighting on the keys. It doesn't really light up the keys evenly, some keys are just more lit than others like the Space Bar which is only half -way lit. The colors of the different areas mix together too much so the ""WASD"" keys can't really stand out if you give them a different color."
375148,3,"This game makes better use of its interactive elements than Heavy Rain did, and the horror genre seems very well-suited to this kind of ""choose-you-own-adventure"" format, but it doesn't feel as innovative as it promises to be.

89598,3,"It's finally here. I heard about this game early 2007 and thought it sounded good. If I could've played it then, I probaby would have enjoyed it. Instead they kept pushing off the release date and my anticipation clearly grew too much, because I was very dissapointed when I started playing it. The early game was almost infuriating with my introduction to the seemingly endless swarms of enemies where you have no choice but to dive around the screen in slow motion for ten minutes to clear each area. I prefer a cleaner approach, sniping enemies or luring them away from the rest, and in the early part of the game that just wasn't possible. At that point I couldn't wait to finish the game just so I could give it a one star review. Then, as the levels progressed, you pretty much stay in-doors, and with the better weapons that became available, I was able to use my ambush tactics much more often. At that point, being able to better control the battles, the game became much more enjoyable. By the time I finished off the final boss, I almost regretted it ending. As another reviewer said the graphics are just okay, and the weapons are a little too realistic (as opposed to, say, Rachet's force field launcher) but altogether, as long as you don't mind furious and really long gunbattles, I'd say this game is a decent rent."
145586,3,"I really enjoyed Far Cry and Crysis...this is neither.  Some of it is fun, like driving around in Africa and big game hunting (which has nothing to do with the game).  But when I drive through a checkpoint, kill all of them and drive out of sight; the checkpoint regens all of the bad guys.  It would have been better had there been a time delay or at least a truck goes by full of bad guys to replace them.

Also, it is annoying to fire 12 - 15 rounds of 7.62mm into a bad guy at point blank range before he falls...especially given that he was wearing a t-shirt and not some nano-suit.  So the ballistics damamge modeling is sophmoric.  And the story is distracting, not motivating.  You can have an NPC accompany you on certain ""missions"", but you really won't care about them and they do nothing for the story.

Overall, I wanted to like this game, and some parts are cool...but it has no replay value."
147700,3,"I realize this game has been reviewed to death here at Amazon but I figured I would add my own two cents considering I am not a regular fan of the series.  The only Resident Evil game I have played in the past was Resident Evil 2 and I never played the much accalimed Resident Evil 4 so I will not be comparing this game to that classic.  I will be judging Resident Evil 5 on itself alone and what it tries to be compared to what it ends up being.

First off, I played this game through on coop with a friend as it clearly was not designed with singleplayer in mind.  I will not comment much on singleplayer as my time with it was limited but thanks to the limited A.I. of Sheva, your partner, you spend a large chunk of your time babysitting her and monitoring her inventory instead of enjoying yourself.  It's perfectly playable on singleplayer, but this game was made for a cooperative experience.

Moving on to coop, Resident Evil 5 is a fun game with a friend.  It is not the best out there and suffers from some awkward game design decisions but you should have a good enough time playing through this game with a human partner.  During my playthrough I noticed that the game had a rather dated feel to it underneath the gorgeous coat of polish.  The graphics in this game are quite impressive, even in split screen coop.  The screen is split in a way where the top view is not directly above the bottom view, but where the top screen is to the left of the top portion of your tv and the bottom screen is to the right.  There is a blank black space to one side of each screen which I felt could have been used for U.I. data such as ammo count, health and the mini-map so none of this obstructs your view when playing the game.  The blank space is just a waste of space imo.

The characters are quite detailed, they look good, the enemies are just as impressive and the bosses can be a sight to behold.  The environments are just as meticulously detailed with some impressive lighting effects in certain levels but there is not nearly as much object interaction or environmental destruction as I would have liked (such as shooting out lights) and the level design is very linear.  Nice looking levels but I feel as if I am being pushed along from point A to B on a set and predetermined path which makes the levels feel much smaller and confined than they should.

The gameplay is where the mixed emotions come with this game.  Yes it is fun, but it seems as if it could have been much better had they just added in some basic controls that are commonplace today.  I never did quite get used to having to stop dead in my tracks to aim my weapon and fire, it's just awkward.  The game does not even allow the player to reload while on the movie, you have to come to a complete stop.  Stopping would be fine if it was to steady your aim but it would just make sense for the game to allow you to shoot, or at least reload, while on the move to provide for a more fluid gameplay experience.  There are also no evasive maneuvers in the game either which make the controls feel even more restrictive and there is no designated melee button, just a QTE option which appears if you stun an opponent with a gun shot.  This QTE driven melee I found to be unintuitive and a hassle.  The one move you have in the game to make your character more nimble is a side strafe, which is as basic as it gets, but at least it's still there.  You can sprint too, thankfully.

The aiming and shooting itself works just fine though.  It's a pretty old system, but I took pleasure in using it.  Challenging enough where you have to steady your aim to get that perfect shot but accessible enough where you don't waste too many bullets and suddenly find yourself out of ammo.  Shooting and killing is fun and the weapon selection is decent but nothing too special.  There are a couple special weapons in the game which are very cool to use but they can only be used in certain spots.

The sound of the weapons is a little underwhelming, particularly the shotgun which just didn't have the Boom I would expect it to have.  Environmental sound effects were much better and the voice acting was decent.  The story was forgettable, but perhaps that is because I'm not too familiar with the RE lore considering I only played one other game in the series.

The one game in the franchise I played before this, RE2, was true survival horror.  It scared the crap out of me in certain areas, I will never forget that room with the two way mirror where I just knew something would jump out of it, and eventually something did, as soon as I stopped expecting it.  That game got me everytime, it was an amazing experience.  I knew going in that Resident Evil 5 would be an action game so I will not take points off like some for it not being scary at all, but it's not a grade A action experience either.  It just isn't as good as other top quality, high octane shooters out there because of the restictive controls.  Even Dead Space, which is a much slower paced game that relies on horror more than action, felt more flexible with it's controls.  I just didn't see the reason to keep the constricted survival horror controls of the old days in what is now an all out, unapologetic action shooter.  It feels like this game has an identity crisis where it can't completely let go of the past, yet wants to evolve into something else.  Still definitely worth a look, I just hope the series finds itself in the next installment.

There is also a horde like Mercenaries mode at the end which I played for a bit but I am not too big a fan of these types of modes.

Pros:
- Graphics
- Boss Fights
- Coop Gameplay
- Fun Action

Cons:
- Gun Sounds
- Restictive Controls
- Convoluted Story with a predictable twist
- Frustrating Single Player thanks to bad partner A.I.
- Linear levels with a set path that feel confined

As a letter grade I would give Resident Evil 5 a ""C"""
31108,3,"Title basically said it all. This game was ok at first but it got old quick. Every level acts and looks the same.

448048,3,"This is a decent little crossover game with Spiderman and the X-men. The best part about it(and maybe the only good thing about it),is you have the option of choosing between either Spiderman,Wolverine,Cyclops,Storm or Gambit,each with their own unquie abilities and stages. The first stage must be completed before you can choose between the characters though. Which involves using Spiderman to look for bombs. This stage is pretty simple. But it gets alot harder after that. The gameplay is alright and the game has a nice soundtrack. Unfortunatly the rest of it falls short,with bad graphics and really annoying sound effects. Overall,this is still a decent game and I would only recommend it to diehard Marvel fans. The casual fan might wanna try something else."
16455,3,"A great game if you have loads of time on your hands.  Many RPG-ers like the complexities of this game, like setting everything yourself, including countless subdivisions of attributes and skills.  I just find it annoying and taking time away from fighting monsters and searching for powerful weapons and magical items.  If you are a true, hard-core RPG fanatic, you will love this game.  If you like to play old-school RPGs like the Ultima and Might and Magic series, Neverwinter Nights may be a little too over-the-top."
12307,3,"Xenogears is an odd game that manages to both excel and fail horribly at the same time.

GRAPHICS / VISUALS

For the time it came out in, the graphics are decent.  When exploring sometimes becomes difficult to navigate when underground though, becuase the low-res washed out ""rock/earth"" textures all blur together making it difficult to tell if something is a wall, or has something you can jump onto, etc.  Also, while the game allows you to move the camera, it's just a token gesture since you can't change the elevation or distance.  Oftentimes you'll be completely unable to see the character as he goes between two tall buildings or things like that.

The game features some anime cutscenes which are, unfortunuately, mostly worthless.  They're well drawn, but are often nothing more than something like 2 characters staring at eachother for 5 seconds; with the exception of the ending almost no plot ever happens during them.

The combat visuals, however, are great for its time.  The characters do more than just move up and swing a sword.  You can chain different moves together (and learn deathblows, which are powerful combinations) that are usually visually appealing.  For instance, a character will run up, punch, jump in the air and do a sping kick, sweep the enenmy as they land and then finish off with a headbutt.

GAMEPLAY

While the combat graphics are nice for its era, it also makes the battles take too long (and boy are they frequent, often 1 random encounter/ 2 seconds of movement).  It's like final fantasy summons all over again, making each combat last minutes upon minutes...even when you fight the enemies from level 1 when you're level 60 it still takes forever.

There is a bit of load time anytime you change rooms/go into your character menu etc. Very annoying.

My 2 biggest complaints are:

The dialogue is waaaaaaay too slow.  There is a lot of excessive dialogue, a lot of repetition, and it comes on the screen so slow you'd think a 4-year old child was typing it.  Sometimes you will have to go through an hour and a half worth of this only to get to a difficult part in the game, die, and have to go through all of that dialogue again without the chance to save in between.

Secondly, as many reviews here have pointed out, the 2nd disc is drastically different.  I thought people were exaggerating; they were not.  It happens suddenly.  Exactly at the point you put the second sic in, most exploration is taken away from you.  A character literally sits in a chair and tells you what happened.  It becomes 1 hour of dialogue, then fight.  2 hours of dialogue, then fight, etc.  You get to explore again though right before the very last dungeon.

CHARACTERS / STORY / PLOT

This is where the game is good...for the most part.

In typical squaresoft fashion (or is it just all Japanese RPGs?) the main character is fairly UNlikable.  He's whiny, immature, a jerk even though he means well, and at times a bastion of self-sacrifice and purity in the name of good willing to risk everything for some small good and pulling it off through rediculous Deus Ex Machina.

Fortunately, in typical squaresoft fashion, the supporting cast is well done.  There's a suprising depth to most of the characters, above and beyond most games I've seen.  Most are mature, and the game itself brushes with some mature topics of innosence, when is war right/justified, the cost of it and what its worth to end one.

The story is a bit overlarge.  It's good, but needed an editor to trim it down a bit as it just gets too big for its britches by the end of the game.

Overall I enjoyed the game.  I'm glad to have played it, but some of the gameplay problems means I have no desire to ever play it again."
182074,3,"After reading reviews for the G35 headset and finally making the purchase for them, I was expecting something a little better than what I got. I had purchased a USB set to bypass the barely adequate onboard sound on my motherboard, but it doesn't seem worthwhile for the sacrifices necessary to use this headset.

The sound quality is average, with highs and mids being fairly decent but the bass is thick and muddy. I certainly wasn't impressed, and it's not good enough to fall into the range of other well-reviewed regular sets in this price range like Grado SR-80i's or Sennheiser HD280 Pro's. The surround sound isn't a big enough deal to compromise the sound quality and features necessary to use this set over comparably priced regular headphones, making these a bit pointless unless you really have to have a USB headset and can't use onboard sound.

They're also really heavy; surprisingly and uncomfortably so. They're the heaviest set of headphones I've tried, and are considerably heavier than even a big set like the HD280's; there are included headphone bands meant to find a better fit, but I didn't find that they did anything at all to help with the wearer fatigue that the weight brings on. The cups also are a bit oddly shaped and pinch to your head on narrow cup edges, making them horrible to wear when I had my glasses on. They aren't as oppressive without glasses, but they still have an awkward and clunky fit that I don't care for.

The software included with them provides functionality for the G-keys, but really nothing else at all aside from an indicator to tell you when it last received a surround signal. The bass and treble boosts in the software mimic the Windows functions available, and there was absolutely no other equalizer or tweaking to be done with the headset. Extremely disappointed in the software and lack of customization and tools offered here, especially when the higher-end headphones Logitech offers have software options that are missing here and shouldn't be. Software updates don't appear to be coming, either, as they haven't received an update since October of 2010.

If you don't need the USB option and are determined to buy a gaming headset, the Turtle Beach gaming headsets are better sounding and lighter, especially combined with something like the EarForce DSS amplifier that the DX11's come with. A better option would be a modest headphone amp combined with a decent set of headphones, and it is going to get you something much, much better than what the G35 offers and can do it for a similar price. I'll either be returning them or giving them to someone else, and decided to go with a good pair of headphones and do something else about the onboard sound instead as these have too many downsides and are too restricted by the USB-only connection to make them worth the cost. Two stars as a pair of headphones, three if you really want them for the USB feature and headset mounted volume and G-keys."
89094,3,"First off, when you buy this game, lets just hope you didn't buy them for the Party/Mini-Games, bileve me, they are bad. I few of them are pretty good like racing or the FPS one, but most of them just don't work right, and get pretty boring after a few plays. The Graphics are okay, Framerate can drop in the space world for some reason which can get frustrating at times. The Story/Single Player mode is pretty fun, The controls added the level of difficulty so if you don't like hard games don't pick this one up, I found it easier to move in all directions by holding the front and back ends of the Wii Remote with my fingers. Music is good but I expected better from a Monkey Ball game (previous titles had great techno music) Overall, this is a decent title, its probably like 30 bucks now so I recommend it for someone who likes hard labrynth style games."
41074,3,"This game has had the same motive since the beginning. Which is to tap the square button repetitively until about 1000 soldiers fall on the floor.

But this is what makes the Dynasty Warriors games their own person and can be quite interesting. It's set in ancient China in the time of the Three Kingdoms (want a history lesson? Tough you're not getting one.). And you can start off Musou mode (the main story) with either of the Three Kingdoms Wu, Wei or Shu. (Tee hee those names sound like phonetic spelling)

Now for every level the easiest way to win is just to simply run straight through a crowd of enemies, kill them in a few button bashes, run to the leader kill him and... YAY YOU WON!!!

However if your a committed gamer like me you will get bored of this and try to play the game properly and that of course is far more enjoyable. With cut scenes and random stuff it makes the game slightly thicker. HOWEVER!!! After playing it solidly for a while YOU WILL GET ANNOYED AT THE SITE OF THIS GAME. It gets sooo repetitive that you'll put it down and play Final Fantasy all over again. Yes there are alot of characters but is that enough? Yes for a little while but it all gets boring in the end.

Buy the game, play it for a week, STOP!!!, then play it again after you had the break. Seriously playing it for too long and you will get bored."

50457,3,"Sword of Mana may not be the best in the Series, but it is still a fairly enjoyable game nonetheless. Action and puzzles are satisfying enough to keep people busy for a while, and the gameplay is decent enough.
There are a few flaws though, my biggest complaint is how idiotic the A.I. for your partner can be, you can set their pattern, but it doesn't seem to do much as they recklessly dive into battle. Music and backgrounds are fine, though it can be annoying sometimes if you or an enemy moves behind a cliff or tree and you have no clue where you or the enemy is. Lastly, the game is fairly short, and though the diffrences in the Hero and Heroine's stories are there, they still lead you roughly on the same trail.
Despite it's rough edges, the game is still fun to play, it may not hold a candle to Legend or Secret of Mana, but it is still a good enough game in the series."

178130,3,"Bioware has made many potentially great games only to fail ultimately due to sterile worlds, flat characters and boring stories. I enjoyed Knights of the Old Republic the most, probably due to the Star Wars theme and healthy injection of humor. I didn't expect much from Dragon's Age and that's what I got. Not only is it a tedious play, but the mechanics of combat and other systems in the game are unintuitive and never explained in either the manual or in-game tutorials. The story and quests are standard fair and fairly linear. Due to branching paths only a fraction of the game will be seen on one playthrough, but I enjoyed it so little I have no interest in seeing what else is there after I beat it the first time."
42292,3,"After playing Triple Play last year, I was looking quite forward to MVP this year.  The graphics and sound are both really impressive.  The gameplay is interesting, but can get boring.  The batter can hit up or down or inside/outside, but no movement of the batter him/herself.  The pitching is much improved in that you have a zone to target for maximum pitch effectivness except the pitches are highly accurate, and the computer opponent rarely swings at balls outside the strike zone.
Overall it is fun to play for a few times but gets boring after awhile (and homeruns are nearly impossible to hit).  Wait until they improve it more next year."
123037,3,"I have never played the original Condemned, so starting off with the sequel with already developed characters was a bit disorientating. I had absolutely no idea what to expect from this game, but for 5 I couldn't refuse, especially after the disappointing Resident Evil 5.

In Condemned 2 you play Ethan Thomas, a burnt-out drunk and former special agent. When people across the unnamed city start to go crazy you're brought in to kick some ass and find out why.

The game is set in the ugliest of places, from abandoned hotels, factories, back alleys. Everything is dank and depressing. The graphics are not the best but sure do impress with their grottiness. What IS remarkable though is the gut-wrenching sound design, which is not only the best video game sound I have ever heard but would rival the most superior of Hollywood horrors. If you have a home theatre hooked up to your PS3 then be prepared for a horrifying atmosphere made entirely of sound to flood into your living room.

But...a first person beat-em-up? I understand that the FP perspective makes the game even scarier, but it just doesn't fit a beat-em-up. When fighting bad guys your chances are almost down to luck with skill being nearly irrelevant.

However, since I was very much let down by RE5 I was surprised just how shocking and creepy Condemned 2 was. I was well worth the money and I recommend it despite it's flaws.

Pros:

Disgusting production design that will make you head straight for the shower.

Truly menacing sound.

Cons:

Clunky fight system

Load times are a pain.

410651,3,"UPDATE 11/5 - Bounties have been buffed to earn you more credits or XP when completed. If the Coalition keeps this up a lot of Gear heads will change their minds about this game.

UPDATE 10/24 - The Coalition seems to be listening to feedback about the difficulty of earning credits. Now you earn more credits in Horde and after every boss wave the credits earned get progressively higher. Just like XP for your chosen class gets progressively higher after every boss wave. Also you get bonus credits after leveling up. It's by no means perfect but it's a definite improvement over what we had before.

I love the Gears of War games, except for Judgement. This is a good start for a new generation but its hard for me to recommend this game. Dont get me wrong this is a fun game and overall a good addition to the Gears universe. But the micro transactions, the insane amount of grinding needed if you don't buy the micro transactions, the overpriced season pass, and the below issues with Horde are definitely worth mentioning before you buy. If you're a fan of shooters or Gears of War and don't mind micro transactions shoved in your face then this is a worthy investment.

The campaign is short but sweet with only 5 acts. Each act will keep you busy for a while. The story builds up to what will happen in Gears 5 and 6. Horde is a lot of fun but I feel the devs should have gone back to Horde 2.0 and see what made it so great. Here's what I think of the new Horde.

Pros
- The class system is excellent and works very well in Horde 3.0.
- Enemy AI is top notch.
- New weapons are fun to use.
- The 10 new maps are unique (except for an updated Gridlock) and most of them have multiple areas you can defend in Horde.

Cons
- Do you remember in Horde 2.0 when Locusts would say cool things like ""Die Huuumon"", ""Advancing"", ""Sky Fire!"", ""Booom"", ""Grrrind"", and laugh at you? You will hear almost none of that from the new swarm enemies in Horde 3.0. Don't get me started on the robots.
- No ghost cam after you die.
- Severe lack of enemy variety makes the waves predictable.
- All of the humanoid Swarm enemies look the same. The Locusts had various helmets, hats, uniforms, and armor.
- No offline support for Horde mode! You need Xbox live gold to play a private match which is just plain stupid.
- No joining games in progress. So if players drop from your game you might as well restart with a new team. It's difficult to complete all 50 waves, especially when you're trying to complete a bounty!
- You start with almost no characters, no skins, and basic class cards. In order to get more of these you need to grind A LOT. Or you can spend real money and get all of these faster. Basically there is a paywall in the game.

Season Pass - The season pass is NOT worth the amount of money they are charging IMO. It comes with everything below. The most important thing are the new maps which will be in the match rotation anyway. The maps are only worth it if you intend to play private matches.

VIP Vintage Pack - Vintage JD character skin, vintage Gnasher and Dropshot weapon skins, vintage JD emblem, and vintage JD bounty that gives you extra XP.

Permanent DLC map ownership for 24+ maps - At least two per month for 12 months for private play on dedicated servers.

Developer Playlist - This lets you play upcoming modes, maps, and variants before they are released publicly.

Starter Airdrop (17 Gear Packs) - These let you unlock character and weapon skins, as well as equipment and abilities, along with bounties that offer extra XP."
411638,3,The first few hours of this game was refreshing because the game makes you feel in control and shows you things you've never seen as you explore planets and moons in whatever system you are in. You are fully in charge of your own survival. The control is pretty easy to grasp and feels smooth. However after I spent over 60 hours playing this game I realized I was doing the same thing over and over again. It needs more content and maybe the reason is because there isn't really a story line.
80531,3,This is a good game not a great game. The side quest are really a waste of time! You go running all over Ivalice to complete some quests only to have them give  you 2 remedies! I got one side quest that had me talking t oa chicken I got a bow but the weapon was only what?...36 attack points. the weapon I had at the time was 75..all that running around for what. Then you have to fight for the Espers..(thats what they call them now)for what never use them! For them to build their hit points you have to power up yourself by that time you complete the game. To obtain them first you have to fight them okay that makes sense but don't you think I would like to at least control them once I beat them!! Arent they suppose to be under the casters control? I would only recommend this game if your collecting the Final Fantasy series and your a die hard fan. Final Fantasy 10 is way better in my opinion.
358667,3,"this is a great concept for a campaign mode but it was executed wrong. the story should have been filled with Choices that actually effect the outcome of the episodes. do you tell the detective that your partner abused a suspect?? do you kill a high profile suspect??? if you know of two places a deal is going down in, which one do you attack first??? and if you pick the wrong one, what happens next??? unfortunately, you don't get to make these choices....you just get to play along. also, theres a level where you're in a huge swamp and i literally couldn't figure out WHAT TO DO NEXT and there was no prompt to tell me so i got aggravated and lost the desire to even continue the story at all. personally, i think they shouldve given us an open section of Miami to patrol and stop random crimes in one or 2 of the episodes...but again, another idea gone to waste.

multiplayer wise, RESCUE mode is the only mode i liked. its last-man-standing, which is my favorite. i like the fact that you can beat the hostages with your stick lol this provides hilarity. i love the breathing effect with the gas mask.....and how your character has comments whenever he kills someone....and just normal chatter while shooting it out. the maps themselves for THIS mode are good, i think theres about 6 of them overall. this is the only fun you will have with the multiplayer but its WORTH IT.

buy it for the RESCUE mode online.....please don't buy it if you want a deep and engaging single player experience."
55695,3,"I had a blast playing the first two R&C games, but I just cannot get into this one--which is surprising given the rave reviews.  I'm a person who likes to PLAY video games, not watch them (that's what movies are for...I thought), and this game is nothing but one annoying cutscene after another.  It's also not nearly as linear as the last two games were...you keep having to go back to that stupid mother ship thing which seems to have no point whatsoever.  It's becoming a real chore to try and force myself to play through this game.  Doubt I'll make it to the end before I sling it back up for sale.  Oh well!"
491491,3,"A poorly marketed game for a poorly marketed console. It wasn't until I bought the game and played for a while that I realized that the game has a significant online component. It's 100% optional and I believe most, if not all, game content is playable single-player, but it seems clear that it's intended that players play online with others. The President of Monolith Soft, Tetsuya Takahashi, also seems to want to port this game to Switch, and if there's crossplay between the WiiU and Switch versions then that will mean an influx of new players for this game's online, which will perhaps make this game better able to deliver it's full, intended experience."
100897,3,the game had to be returded
116046,3,"This game is okay. I bought this for the PS3, when it comes to shooting your target it's hard. Because when you try to get the mark on the target you go too much to the left or to much to the right and buy the time you get the mark on the target, they have been shot already."
162136,3,"I really enjoyed the first 2 Max Payne games. I liked how they created the graphic novel effect. This new game tries to emulate that with long cutscenes, but those aren't nearly as creative as the first two. The main thing I did not like is that this is the shortest & most constricting Rockstar game I've played (vs. GTA, etc.). There really is very little time & ability to explore. Even getting the golden guns & clues is difficult because you are forced into linear action, and cannot return to most areas. This was your basic shooter game & not much else. For me, a real let-down from Rockstar. If they would have opened up the environment and added side-missions etc., it would have been much better. The most positive thing was that this has probably the best graphics I've seen from Rockstar. But glad I only spent $30.00 on Ebay instead of the $60.00 retail price."
358381,3,I like the game. Plain and simple.
374387,3,It's ok !!!
203184,3,"Saw 2 is hands and shoulders above its predecessor. Campbell and Michael are the main game players, both suffering from severe inner ear problems and vertigo as well as crippling polio, judging by there inability to walk a foot wide board of wood and running speed of just past crawling. With as twisty and complex a story as any Saw movie, the story holds up rather well. Michael Tapp finds himself in a stretch of abandoned real estate, trying to free the cops that were part of his fathers police unit.

Like its predecessor, the game struggles for atmosphere, but manages to pull it off rather well. The backgrounds are vivid and well detailed. In place of the same sequence of rooms from the prior game, it moves between a hotel, subway, hospital, and a school. Audio is still all Tobin Bell, though the other characters are well voiced, if a tad whiny and childish. The background from Detective Tapp still misses its mark, as they can't find a good voice actor to sound like Tapp.

Gameplay is where it falls flat. Everything except puzzles is a QTE. Dodging booby traps, holes in the floor and collapsing ceilings, combat and some cinematics, everything is quicktime events. While this sometimes contributes, it more often robs the moment of the feeling its going floor. The traps are repetitively repetitive, though the character traps are well made, few have the metaphorical irony that the Saw movies did so well, and few have any originality, though some are spot on. Boss fights are tedious and banal, and feel more like work. Save points are rare as diamonds, so you better have a good hour to play at each stint.

The tone is all wrong though. Jigsaw rewards ingenuity and drive, but he doesn't punish curiosity. There are too many places where you can be insta killed for trying to find collectibles, one of the few things done exceedingly well and in line with the larger universe story and tone. But there's a shotgun or blade trap on nearly every door, and you're shuttled through like a canal lock, meaning you can't go back and explore.

One great thing is the Billy Doll puzzles, which are optional, are HARD. Not just mind numbing find the combo nonsense, but complex number and logic puzzles. This is a rather tasty bit that I wish had been applied to the larger game, as while some of the puzzles are fun, most are tedious, though nearly all of them are done with a decent amount of thought. A bit more explanation, and raising the bar for the majority of the puzzles would've done great things for this as whole.

Overall, this is a solid rent, but don't be surprised if you find yourself wanting to put an axe through the TV. Given this is twice the quality of the initial foray, hopefully the third installation will be of the quality of the original saw movie."
303011,3,"I wanted to write a review so I could finally rant to someone about the problems with this system. I read other reviews before purchasing one on impulse and should have listened to their recommendations. This system was not ready for launch and they should have fixed the plethora of problems before doing so.

Here is a list of everything I have experienced in my few months of playing:
1. Controllers do not stay synced to the Xbox and disconnect frequently
2. Play and charge kit is loose and causes disconnection problems
3. Controllers are linked to specific people and cause problems when handing controllers to different people
4. System and game updates do not work
5. Kinect voice system is inconsistent
6. Xbox turns on randomly (mostly when the controllers are moved)
7. ""Xbox On"" voice command does not work
* And many other problems pertaining to different games

I am considering selling the system and waiting for a considerable update, or buying a PS4 (if I am desperate, of course)."
272882,3,I had a little problem with the front cover for the screen. No matter how hard I try the screen protector will not stay down where my buttons are when I put my PSVITA trigger grip system on. When I took the cover off to replace it; their was a lot of sticky residue from it on there. I had them it on roughly 8 months ago. The rear touch pad cover has stayed on and is still working fine. No need to take it off yet. I suggest you do not get this product and pay more for these. They should be able to last longer and pull of with no residue left on the device.
206245,3,"Update: I would like to thank the fanboys who say my review is not helpful simply because I said something negative about the game, even though I said it honestly and constructively. Of course reviews are only written to express love for something.

I know a lot of people just swoon over GOW I & II like girls over boy-bands, but let me tell you it's not that amazing. I picked this up first for the PS2, both games, used for under $20 and played about half of the first game, but even in wide-screen mode it was hard to play the blurry 480p graphics on my 42"" screen. When this update was announced and IGN praised the graphics (especially GOWII as the first one has horrible cut-scenes that look far inferior to the actual game)I decided the price was too good and with three coming out it seemed like the perfect time to put these two games to rest.

Part one goes by fairly painlessly. The main issue I had where the clunky swimming controls. However, overall it's a fun game, lots of puzzles, exploration and excellent battles to be won. The game does deteriorate slightly near the end as the constant need to press the right button at the right moment as they flash on the screen becomes the most important thing in the game -- this substituting for the brilliantly complex way say Link or Samus would have to kill a boss, is a cop-out in design and damned pointless.

The second game get's hairy. This time around fighting is an afterthought, the God of War is of course dragged down and turned mortal again (so we can have a sequel)immediately making the game feel unworthy and more like a cheap attempt to capitalize on the first. But he doesn't really have to fight, most of the game is spent doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and ... until you GET IT RIGHT. At the moment of writing this review I am facing down an impossible task, pull a lever, lower a door, run to a vent, double jump, fly to roof and coast over door before it slams shut ... yeah, right. You have to literally be running back to that vent before the game camera pans away from that door.(the real flaw here is logic, this guy breaks down huge stone walls, he can't chip a piece off, jam the lever open and just casually climb over???) There is NOT ONE SECOND of room for error and that defines this game, do it, do it again, keep doing it until it's perfect. Most of the hard puzzles could be solved by jamming a stone in a lever or tying something off with a bit of rope -- the logic here defies reason, why on earth do all these complex tasks when simple solutions are present but the game-makers render unavailable, before asking the player to do something really annoying you have to kill off all other logical options. If this was the first game, I'd never finish it, never play a sequel, I'm learning to hate it. There's not a few areas in this game like this, IT'S THE ENTIRE GAME. Every time I turn it on it's ""how many hours of the same screen/task today? This entire game is designed around how fast and perfect you can press buttons. It gets very frustrating as you double jump from swinging grapple to grapple and as you pound the R1 button to grab the next grapple he grabs the last one again instead, when double jump doesn't register and you fall like a stone and have to start an area over. It's not the challenge, it's the fact that the game relies on both controller and player to be PERFECT task after task there's no room and that brings the game down.

I hope GOWIII is more like one and not at all like two."

403443,3,"Five stars is not a perfect game, but a perfectly FUN game. As of this review I've played 9 hours and zero technical issues. Game looks great, runs great. Buy with confidence if this game interests you at the least.

Speaking if interest- If you've never played a Fallout, but like an RPG-Action-Collect everything type game with a good story (so far), then this is a winner. If you enjoyed Fallout 3 then you owe it to yourself to play Fallout 4, feels like the previous game except better in most every way. While I'm doing my thing in Fallout 4, my character from Fallout 3 could be running around doing his/her thing too, 450 miles south. That's how familiar everything feels to the previous game. It's not feeling repetitive at all though because Fallout 4 looks so beautiful. Faded colors abound, decayed everything looking very realistic, little details everywhere. When your roaming around alone and on your guard, the audio does a great job of making you feel alone, conveying enemy and environment sounds so it feels like you're there. There's also a new game play mechanic, the Settlements, which I won't go into because I don't want to spoil how it works. Part of the fun is figuring it out yourself, right? I had a great time figuring out how it works and I'm still learning because it's so in depth. Excellent new addition to the franchise.

I have a long way to go in this game as of this review, but my opinion stands: Fallout 4 is a must play game, even more than the previous one. You'll enjoy getting lost in the wasteland.

EDIT: The review above was after 8-10 hours. During the next 8 hours of play I ended up stopping all together without bothering to get one of the endings. I was starting to see how thin the writing had become compared to FO3, how much the dialog choices weren't really choices at all. This is a well made game just not nearly what I expected, or wanted, in Fallout."
476549,3,good
109760,3,"Price: There are several games that are almost exactly like Battle March. Halo Wars, Command & Conquer, Ninety-Nine Nights, and the list continues. This game is okay, but not worth paying more than 20.00 USD.

Graphics: Leaves something to be desired. The characters look like little underdrawn beings without true detail. Not much attention was given to the graphics or design of this game. A basic program obviously.

Gameplay: Nothing special or bad, standard military strategy game. If you beat Command & Conquer or Halo Wars...this ones in the bag.

Controls: Were easily understood. No issues here. Really simple to use.

Scenery: 2D at its best, you will find the game designers did not put much effort into the games scenery.

Overall: I bought it and regret buying it. A waste of my hard earned cash. I will no longer be buying any game that has Warhammer labeled on its cover. Some people may like these filler games, not me. They are filler games, because they take up space."
137777,3,not as good as 1 or three. kinda boring in places. still an ok shoot-em-up game for most of us.
399759,3,"There's been so many games I have purchased inexpensively and never beat since they've been so average.  I consider this a game in that category.  Having played two of the previous games, I have to say that the graphics, and more importantly the controls, are far superior in this iteration.
The problem is the setting and the environment.  This game is very seedy and would probably be the equivalent of a straight to dvd R-rated movie, too many expletives without much context.  Where are the missions like in the past games where you go into foreign countries taking out some general, or the great White House mission.  Now it's one dank alley after another taking out sleazebags without any context.
The game play also has some issues.  I think the developers lacked imagination and for that reason only included a few open ended ""hitman"" scenarios.  Many of the levels are not assassination scenarios, but rather sneak and escape.  Single start point, single exit point, multiple corners and paths, you choose the path from A to B, through a maze of enemies and civilians.
I'll only play when I have more extra time, but this game does not draw me back at all."
286360,3,"Every year I look at reviews for this game and always see the same thing. This game is garbage,has all these problems and they are not buying it anymore. The next year I see the same thing. Why do people keep buying this game if they have already made up their mind it is flawed in some way? Now to my review, I cannot understand why EA puts out golf,hockey and soccer games every year and they all seem to get better every year. They find something that works and just add to it in these games. But Madden is the biggest of them all and they find it necessary to keep giving and taking away. Granted this is an improvement over last year's disaster but something is still missing. The biggest problem is why cant they level the AI out based on a player's ability and awareness. No matter what team you play with or against it seems like you are still playing the same one. The schemes don't seem to matter especially on defense. The defensive AI is the same. You have the same chance of burning a lockdown corner as you do a rookie no matter what scheme the team you play has. Ratings play very little part as to how good a team really is. The AI should be based on the players ratings not some one for all AI. If EA can do amazing things with NHL and FIFA every year making them better. Why cant they get it right with Madden and stop giving and taking on it?"
191735,3,It's not as good as the original. There's something missing here. It just does not feel like Guitar Hero to me.

165571,3,"Nuts and Bolts is a good game. Now, it has its fun, but often repeats in style. Banjo was a great platformer game back in the days of N64, and RARE did a good job bringing him over on 360. It is as classy as the old, but definitely shows potential that is not quite hitting the spot. The car building and mechanics are certainly fun and will keep a avid artist playing, the game is somewhat marketed for kids and that is a hard sell due to how in-depth the building is. Still if you were a fan of Banjo-Kazooie before you will love this game, if you are new I recommend holding off for a price drop or trying before making a final decision."
349403,3,"Not as good as 1 & 2, played the whole story coop, and even though it adds to toughness of enemies, it still seemed too tough.  The boss fights were retardedly hard near the end.  Playing as clap trap was fun, and annoyed my friend with the special ability.  But not really worth a second play through, and it was shorter than the other games, trading this in soon.

I'm hoping Tales from the Borderlands is better than this.  :)  LOL"

436315,3,"Will update review as I play more...

So far, there are many promising aspects of the game and a fair number of questionable design decisions.

Positives:
Open world experience from the start
High quality characters models, graphics and location
Unique twist on combat mechanics
Lot of content beyond the main story

Negatives:
Frame pacing issues
Camera can get in the way of combat
Voice acting on some characters in questionable
Odd mixture of fantasy, technology and sponsored content (Coleman camping gear?)
Expensive Deluxe Edition which only has a moving and some DLC"
292391,3,"I've always been a fan of Sony's consoles and this was no exception. However, I had to give it a low rating because very soon after my warranty expired, my system started acting up with the now well-known disc ejection problem. Sometimes I can play a game for a few hours straight or even watch a movie without any problems, but then sometimes, I'll be in the middle of something and the disc will just randomly pop out.

Other times, I might wake up in the morning to find a disc sitting halfway out of the slot or sometimes on the floor."
70978,3,"If I were simply rating this as the quickest way to get 1000 gamer points (just finish the game) it would be a 5 star review.  However that's about all King Kong is good for.

Pros:
-Great voice acting: if you're a fan of Jack Black you will enjoy his comments throughout
-New take on shooters: rather than a display showing how much ammo you have left you click B and your character says how many clips you have left. (You can also go into options to have your remaining ammo displayed)
-Also when you run out of ammo there are plenty of spears to throw at enemies
-Great graphics:  Obviously the graphics are now eclipsed by this year's giants, but they are much better than old Xbox games.
-Taking on T-Rexes and V-Rexes as King Kong is a blast!

Cons:
-Very short: you can beat it in one weekend.
-Puzzles are too easy:  for every puzzle you light a stick on fire and burn thorn bushes, the only hard part, sometimes, is finding the fire
-Too dark:  There are many places where you can't figure out where you're going because you can't see.
-Very linear:  The whole time you're in a corridor and all you do is move forward.

I can only recommend this game if you're either a huge Jack Black and King Kong fan or if you want a quick 1000 gamer points.  If you're a fan then you've already got this game.  If you want easy points you can't beat that price!"
274454,3,"I purchased this under the misconception that I'd be able to play co-op on one system, so it's really my own fault for not reading closely enough about the game.

From what I've seen, it looks like it would be a fun game like a more realistic looking L4D.

However, I have no interest in going through the campaign alone and my friends and I don't plan on paying for Live anytime soon, so I'll be passing on this one."
86205,3,"I am 77% through the game and I was liking it up to this point. Finding different Golems through out the game reminds me kind of a Pokemon game except they don't evolve and they don't learn new abilities unfortunately. I guess i'll do some pros and cons of the game.

+ Fast paced battles. You sometimes have to be very strategic up against the stronger enemies. The good thing is it gives you the option to retry the same battle if you lose instead of having to load up from another save point.
+ You can save anywhere in the game. If you go into a battle against a lost golem and are using the wrong characters to defeat it you can load up the last save before you get to them and switch characters.
+ Lot's of different golems to use throughout the game.

Now for my negatives

- VP is stupid. When you play the game you will at some point come across the Holy Beast Shrine. The further you explore the more like a maze it becomes. Making it harder to get to heal spot to increase your VP. The thing about VP is that each character starts out with a certain amount and once it hits 0 that character will enter all battles with only 1 HP and if the enemy get's a jump on you your dead. Doesn't even give you a chance to escape.

- The game only allows you to carry 9 of each healing item. I don't like that. In the Holy Beast Shrine you can use all the heal items you can get. So I guess it was ok up to that point.

The game in all though is pretty fun. Like any other RPG though you will usually hit a frustrating point."
216851,3,"I have conflicted feelings about this game. Me and a friend had a blast on it last night, but at the same time there are so many glaring problems that I can't give it more than a few stars.

Rising Storm
cons
-AI is beyond retarded. Apparently these soldiers are trained that the best way to take me out is to crowd together, rush up to within 5 feet of me, and then pump their guns in the air like they just won the lottery while I hose them down while shaking my head at their lack of brains
-Like so many other move shooters, the buttons on the move controller are crucial to playing the game.. so if you are picture yourself holding a pistol out in one hand picking off enemies.. not gonna happen. Both hands are required and it takes away from the immersion
-Story mode is incredibly difficult to navigate, and suffers from at least equally retarded enemies if not more so
-At one point in arcade mode, a bridge keeps collapsing and we fall down, our soldiers look around and say something like ""well we didn't get as far as we wanted but we completed our mission, lets go home boys"" roll credits, game over. I know that can't be the end of the game but it sure makes you think it is. Very strange.

Pros
-If you have a precision shot or battlerifle then it's kind of fun to hose down enemies.. as long as your gun attachment feels like a full auto gun and you can reach reload buttons
-I guess that's about it.. not a fan of rising storm

Time crisis 4
Pros
-Much more intelligent enemies, much more tactical approach. Instead of blasting mobs that are standing in front of you not attacking, you fight enemies behind cover that actually shoot at you so it requires some accuracey and strategy. Way more fun.
-I guess that's about it.. it's just way more fun and challenging than rising storm

Cons
-Suffers from same problem of having to use move buttons to reload and cover. Neither game will allow you to use the nav for these functions which is mind boggling to me.
-Also suffers from head-scratching moments where you die, yet complete the level and move on. Kind of the opposite of rising storm, where you don't die but the game ends

Haven't had a chance to try the pirate game yet, but from what I'm reading it sounds like a good one as you don't have to use extra buttons and can just hold a pistol like you should and shoot stuff.

All in all, it's not a complete waste of money considering the many different modes and game types.. it's fun to play if you have good move attachments (battle rifle is my fav), but it does have it's fair share of flaws that really heavily detract from the experience.

If you are dieing to shoot some stuff with a friend, by all means pick it up, but don't get your hopes up too high. The next wave of move gun games will hopefully fix all of the issues the current ones are having. If your funds are lmitied, wait for the next one."
260228,3,"Everything good, but controller worked like for 6 months and now it's crazy (like i touch circle and it does X.)"
72592,3,"good game but was very disappointed that it wasn't compatible with windows 7 pro or 8.1, had to use it on my old vista computer."
286704,3,"The ergonomic PS3 SC-1 wireless sports controller by Gioteck, designed in the UK and assembled in China, features programmable function buttons, turbo, superior bumpers, front facing channel LEDs, advanced integrated battery, dual vibration feedback, and offset thumbsticks with adjustable sensitivity.  So do all these features translate into a better controller?

The SC-1 controller requires a dongle which uses up a USB port.  I would much prefer the use of Bluetooth, even if it cost me more.  The PS3 only has two USB ports making their use limiting.  I personally wouldn't consider purchasing multiple controllers without Bluetooth capability.  Even purchasing one is questionable for me.

Turbo mode is set by pressing and holding the turbo then the action button.  When set, the turbo LED will flash 8 times once assigned.  Repeating the steps above will remove the turbo setting, as well as powering off the controller.  More than one action button can be assigned to the turbo function at one time, however only a single button can be programmed.  Combo moves cannot use the turbo function.  However, there are two function buttons, F1 and F2, used to program combo moves with sequences of up to 8 actions.

The SC-1 wireless sports controller requires 3.5 to 4.5 hours to recharge, should last for 25 hours of gaming time, and will automatically shut off after 1 minute of inactivity when not connected to the PS3 or 10 minutes when the SC-1 is connected.

With the lack of Bluetooth connectivity, I would look elsewhere if I were in the market for a new controller.  Also, I can't decide if the turbo and function features give me an unfair advantage or its use is a sign of weak game playing.  The controller does feel good to hold and play with; I just don't see the differences from the standard dualshock controller as being better or even enticing.

PROS:
25 hours of gaming time
3.5-4.5 hours charging time
1 year limited warranty

CONS:
Requires the use of a USB dongle"
230157,3,"I've had this game at least a year now, and still haven't finished it. I still keep it becaause it's always something to play when I have no others. Basically, the game is just an item hunt, and very boring and repetitive hunting them. Upgrading weapons and armor is fun, but unfortunately you don't get to do it that often, because this game is very stingy in what it gives you. Most the good stuff has to be combined from smaller items and it just takes too much time to get what you're looking for. It's like a maze of combinations, and it's a little overwhelming when the battles are just so boring and tedious. Not very strategic, but the attack and spell animations are very cool. The combinations of attacks and spells make cooler spells, and you have to experiment to find different attacks and spells. It's just way too stingy and takes way too long. Play it for an hour and take it out type of game. Same battles over and over again. Not gratifying at all. Each to his own though."
40774,3,this is a old game for xbox and a little tedious to play not a lot of exitement in playing this game.dont think that modern gammers will like this game.
277750,3,"Was fun for about 2 days. VERY boring VERY fast. Sorry fanboys, but this game was boring really quick, good thing it is no monthly fees."
481702,3,"Basically a cheap version of gaming glasses. I use it form time to time, but definitely not on the daily for games."
128279,3,"I agree with many of the other reviewers... and was VERY disappointed that the game can be completed in only 9 hours. That seems to be the average of almost everyone who has commented on here and my experience was the same. At the end I said ""that's it?"" Was it $50 well spent? eh, maybe.

Using the wii controls to beat up on stormtroopers and use the force was pretty cool... but as was mentioned by others the graphics are pretty inferior to the other versions. I thought they were pretty good until I saw what this game looked like on the PS3 and 360. Whoa!

The gameplay does get repetitive. It's pretty easy once you get the hang of things. In fact, you can make it through most of the game by grabbing people with the force and throwing them at other people. I had to make a conscious effort to try the other force powers.

This was a good star wars game, but I rate it as middle of the road primarily because of the short length. If I had known it would take that long I would have rented it instead of dropping $50."
236811,3,"I am glad criterion took back the NFS franchise as I trully enjoyed the NFS hot pursuit. NFS most wanted is a lot of fun but has its share of issues on the PC. The multimonitor support is excellent and there is no problem with the sun glare. Now, I am wondering why DICE and criterion did not work together. The perfect NFS would be a mix between the graphics fron the RUN (DICE engine), the controls of Hot Pursuit, and for sure the layout of Hot Pursuit. The Most Wanted seems to be a hybrid between burnout paradise and NFS, which is not the best mix. Anyway, graphics are good and engine sounds are great. The rest is a so-so game which does not really know what it is...AM I NFS? or AM I Burnout Paradise."
255521,3,"game very corky!!!  hardest time getting it calibrated, I ended having to cover the blue buld in order for it to calabrate; and it needs to be total darkness; we only play the game in the evening or at night.  Once calibrated game is fun"
412382,3,"Huge fan of the Animal Crossing New Leaf. This is nothing like New Leaf. I would expect many people who liked NL to be wondering where the game aspect of this game is. There isn't much of a game here so if as a gamer you require positive or negative feedback or points or rewards to feel an accomplishment in a 3Ds release - this aint a program for you. If you can find your own reward for liking your designs then you'll get into it. There are many areas where HHD (Happy Home Designer) could be better: more interaction with towns people; be able to walk around town; some sort of rating or review of designs; or even some design theory if it's supposed to teach something. There is none of that here. You will basically get to jump in and out of character's homes and that's it. I have decided to accept that this is not at all as interesting as previous AC titles. It isn't relaxing, the music isn't as interesting, the dialog is just not so great either. But if you like moving furniture and decor items around then this will satisfy you as a bit of a play set. If you are the kind of person who doesn't like working in an office being told what to do - then you might want to avoid HHD as you are either in an office being told what to do or in a client's home moving around furniture.

The Amiibo cards that you can get to add characters to the game seem to be a complete money grab. I don't see how they are even that interesting to collect as they contain basically no real info on them. They do pull the character into the game, but since there is so little interaction with all characters there isn't much of a reason to care.

If this were a completely new game with new characters (no AC), I'd rate it as 2 stars and expect it to be about twenty dollars. At the current price it's a bit too much for too little. Only for those who are completely into moving furniture items around virtual rooms."
194878,3,We lost interest pretty fast for a game. Out of all the games we habe bouhht' this is in the bottom 10 based on play.
276913,3,The headset cuts in and out. The volume control seems to be the problem with faulty wiring. I got two on clearance from Fred-Meyers and both sets have the same problem after about a month of use.
319443,3,It's a tree rex... not my favorite skylander but this was a gift and they seemed to enjoy it.
108369,3,"First off, let me say I was really pulling for this game.  Despite the bugs that the original had, I have a solidly entertaining run through, both times I played it from start to finish.  I was really looking foward to picking up my old character and making a new run through the NWN universe.

That hope quickly died as I started my first run through.  I opted to create a new character, as I was anxious to take the new genasi out for a spin.  A few min later my fighter/duelist walked out onto the scene.  Over the next few hours I found my anger and frustration growing.  First to rear it's head was AI issues, which had supposedly been worked on.  My wizard buddy still loves to both overspell, and cast spell types inappropriate for the situation (ex, spell resistance in a fight with all melee types).

I also seem to be having some issues with the scaling of combat.  Now, it's possible that it's because I made a new character (18) instead of importing my old one (20).  I'm starting over with the import, but even so, the fights seem incredibly difficult in places.  This almost makes the game unplayable.

So, I am going 3 stars because it's a blend of a 5 star plot (so far), and a 1 star implimentation."
434599,3,"No Mans Sky: Breadth of an Ocean, Depth of a Pool 6/10

No Mans Sky is an ambitious title focusing on the use of procedural generation to craft a unique universe for seemingly infinite exploration. However, there are no scenarios or events florid enough to color the infinite abyss of planets that is No Mans Sky.

The game starts off with the player stranded and having to repair his or her starship by gathering resources. The player also has to be mindful of obtaining resources for life support and environmental protection as well.  The game hits you with resource grinding from the start and it all seems very overwhelming at first. Gathering resources is simply a means of surviving and making money in this game and because the emphasis is solely on gathering resources, much of the gameplay can be redundant.

In terms of what you can do and what you can find during your planetary and galactic expeditions, you can come across: exosuit upgrades, multi-tools, multi-tool upgrades, monoliths for learning alien languages, trading posts, stationary aliens, and crashed ships scattered throughout every planet. While all of that may sound cool, it all becomes unimportant very quickly. Ive gone to about 12 systems exploring more than 50 planets and Ive maxed out my exosuit storage (48 slots) so now any drop pod I stumble across is utterly useless to me. My ship inventory doesnt matter to me anymore because I can just carry everything in my exosuit. Ive purchased a multi-tool with the max amount of slots (24 slots) so theres no point in looking for anything better. Ive learned enough words from the different languages. Enough so that I can make out what the NPCs are trying to tell me. Because of this, going to monoliths can also be a waste of time.

What the game does right is setting up an atmosphere that is perfect for space travel. Going from planet to planet or system to system feels like you're actually traveling through space. However, the map used to follow the Atlas Interface, the center of the universe, or any other waypoints discovered through alien interaction, can mar this. Its such a confusing task to return to a system youve just left or really make your own path in No Mans Sky.

The real problem here is the lack of incentive to keep going or to keep exploring. You cant carry more than one multi-tool so the adventure of finding a new weapon is over. Ive maxed out on my exosuit so theres no incentive to find drop pods. The ONLY thing I want that this game is currently offering is a really cool blue ship I saw at a space station but other than that, nothing. Nothing about this game has compelled me to really keep exploring as much as I did a week or two ago. The universe is very bland and barren. Space pirates can attack you, but they never chase you down to a planet to continue with ground combat. Aside from environmental events like storms, there are no real events that take place on these planets. You mine and grind for more currency so that you can feel like you own a place in the reality of No Mans Sky only to realize that there is no incentive to feel at home.

The game isn't immersive when you get through the first couple hours. No Mans Sky was a game that was meant to feel like you're going through the universe. On any given planet, there should be races walking around, potential firefights, factions, cities, odd jobs, professions, etc. No Mans Sky doesnt offer any of this. Choices between multi-tool upgrades, exosuit upgrades, and starship attachments don't matter because the gameplay has no depth.

For a game that offers 18 quintillion planets, theres very little to see here and its sad because theres so much that couldve have been done. Frankly, anything else wouldve been better. Having this large universe is the only talking point of No Mans Sky, because theres nothing else big enough to make anyone look at this title."
127279,3,"I watched a friend of mine play a demo for this game and some years later ran across a review of this game, The concept of fighting werewolves, Griffons, and other Mythological beasts sounded cool so i bought it, honestly  this game wasn't as cool or as fun as i thought it would be. Don't get me wrong it was okay, beheading a werewolf with an axe or taking down a griffon with a rocket launcher was mildly satisfying but it could have been better I got it for dirt cheap though so I can't complain much"
310061,3,"Kids like it lots.  I thought it was dumb, but I don't have to play it!  Truly a hit with our teens and preteens."
190649,3,Not one of my favorites
311758,3,"This is cool if you are a diehard Fable fan, but the controls are clunky and awkward, and it is full of bugs and glitches. Plus there are multiple areas where you cannot save your progress up to that moment like Fable 2, because you are mid quest you can only save the last checkpoint. And if that quest takes hours, which some do, you can lose tons of hours of work if you actually have a life. I still give it 3 stars because of the very pretty graphics, but I literally beat the game without ever figuring out how to quickly switch between spells, which is essential at many points in the game, In my opinion, Don't buy unless you are a huge fan of the original Fable. Fable 2 is 10000 times better."
183972,4,"The Western theme separates Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood from other first-person shooters, but that wouldn't be enough to recommend it if the game wasn't fun to play on its own merits.  Fortunately, it's a solid FPS in its own right.  It takes a bit to get the hang of surviving, but once common sense kicks in and you learn to duck and cover, you'll find yourself handling them varmints with the best of them!  Although there aren't a ton of upgrades in the weapons, the weapons themselves are satisfying to use.  Couple that with a great story, and you're in for a good time.  Well worth a playthrough. It's worth noting that there is a multiplayer component and it had people in it this morning (12/17/13), so folks are still playing it."
285705,4,Good fun.  For some reason. though. I didn't get into this one.  Not sure why it didn't suck me in like most alawar games do
104618,4,"Not bad all in all. Great graphics! The voice acting is OK, but the lead character sucks, and it pulls me out of the excitement and intensity of the game. The story is great, the occasional freezing is annoying, but once it get warmed up it's no longer a problem. It's fast paced and the realism is makes it interesting.

The biggest set back I already stated, it freezes when you first start it up, at least it does on PS3, and the lead voice actor couldn't act his way out of a paper bag on a soup opera. Everything else is great."
161373,4,I love these games and still enjoy playing this even though I have done it several times.  It also amuses my grandkids when they are here.
56679,4,"I strongly suggest playing (and finishing) the original KotOR before playing this sequel.  Not only will the stories between both games make more sense, but you'll better appreciate the innovations in KotOR 2 such as more customization with lightsabers, being able to create upgrades for equipment (and not merely finding them), additional character development options and the jedi ""prestige"" classes.

Unfortunately, it's the story development in KotOR 2 that makes it its biggest weakness.  Most of the blame could be placed on whoever made the decision to rush this game out the door before it was truly finished.  With extra time, somebody might have realized, for example, that it doesn't really make sense that you don't have a lightsaber early in the game.  Depending upon how far you interact with certain NPCs, you'll find that this part of the story makes even less sense.  The last part of the game doesn't make too much sense, beginning with the last three cut scenes.  I won't give anything away, but if you finish the game, you'll see what I mean.  If LucasArts and Obsidian Entertainment were to ever make a(nother) patch to fix the bugs and the story (mis)developments, it will be GIGANTIC in size.

Even with the latest patch, there are still bugs.  Best example:  here were two side quests I was NEVER able to finish, and it doesn't matter how powerful your ""Exile"" character is.  And those crashes; there were times the game would crash after less than half an hour of running, or running for hours.

There are some things which might be design flaws instead of bugs.  One example is how there are two classes of an armor overlay that can be added to robes (jedi or otherwise) but two higher classes of this overlay that CAN'T be added to robes AND there's no indication of this!  This is disappointing since it takes a rather high amount of specialized skill for your character or NPC to make these overlays.  And it takes a fair amount of time to attain such a high skill level.  Another annoyance is that you can't level up your NPCs while inside the Ebon Hawk, but you could do this in the orginal KotOR.  Another thing that should've been copied over from the orginal KotOR are icon indicators for what effects a character is under in the Character Info screen, which is one keystroke away.  KotOR 2 requires you to go to the Journal menu then click on a submenu option to see the active effects.

At the risk of spoiling the game, I'll give this piece of advice:

Some NPCs can become jedis later while some will NEVER become jedis (and that's not counting droids).  Unless you don't want ANY of the NPCs to become jedis, there's simply no reason to hold on to any kind of armor, no matter how awesome.  You're better off selling it or breaking it down into parts to make other useful items."
183395,4,"Easy achievements, and very fun multiplayer different from your normal Call of Crap games, many vehicles, big maps, one big fun game. Buy it its FUN and affordable."
16117,4,"Bough this game circa 2001. It is now 2013 and I am still playing this game! Too bad video game companies do not still make city builders of this caliber such as Pharaoh, Caesar, etc. That was the highlight of gaming for me."
167701,4,"This game is another good installment of COD. Everything about it is about the same as COD4, except a WWII version. The controls are exactly the same. This time, you play as against Japan. Then, you play as Russian forces against the Germans. The Japan stages are really intense. The Japanese fighters are very aggressive. They will charge at you bayonets. Now, you have a chance to defend the attacks. When they come up, you can press the R3 button and counterattack by stabbing them in the throat. It will remind players of the counterattacks of the dogs in COD4. Some stages will remind a player of COD4. For example, there is another sniper stage called ""Vendetta. In this stage, the player is a Russia soldier in the middle of Germany. The stage is very similar to COD4's ""All Ghillied Up."" Of course, the stage is a lot more intense and a heck of a lot more things are going on. I don't want to spoil it for new gamers, though. The cutscenes are very intense. The only thing is that I'm a little tired of WWII games. That is the only reason why I gave the game 4 stars. Still, if you are a COD fan, this game is for you."
108067,4,"I love this action Star Wars game. It's not a rpg version, but just a straight up action game. Great story with great game play. It's not a 5 star game but definitely a 4 star one. It's a fun play and quite enjoyable"
46706,4,"I'll admit, most of you are probably wondering..""Why waste my time on a game based on a Disney Attraction/Movie? Most licenses like that end up not worth it."" Well, I'm here to tell you that this  game is an enjoyable romp that you nor your kids will want to miss. You navigate through the Haunted Mansion with game environments inspired by the movie and the ride, fight monsters of all sorts(if Spiders give you the willies, this one has it in spades), solve puzzles to uncover hidden clues- passageways and secrets, as well as release 999 trapped spirits. Kind of a mix between Ghostbusters, House, The Addams Family and Casper. Sure, it's on the fairly easy side for those weened on games of this sort but one not to be missed. Why?, you may ask. Well, it's a fun game that is challenging, at times, and will keep you playing til the end. Besides, it's game that the whole family can enjoy(although one player gets to play at a time).
As far as any gripes are concerned with the game, there are very few but need to be addressed just the same(for those considering a purchase) such as: spotty control(at times, it's hard to control you character. Especially during platform moments), the camera movement(it gets a lil whacky, at times. Course, I know of no game with a perfect camera), and the fact that things can get confusing. Yet, overall, none of these things take away from a great game. The things are, actually, minute.
At any rate, like I said before, this  game is an enjoyable romp that you nor your kids will want to miss. One game I highly recommend to all."

326908,4,"First and foremost, a keyboard needs to serve its most basic function: that of translating keystrokes into data. Macros, back-lighting, aesthetics, and other features are great. However, they all come second to how it functions as a keyboard. I write a lot of words each day. In the range of 4-5 thousand. Sometimes more than that. I need a keyboard that makes typing feel effortless and that provides just the right amount of feedback. The Raptor K30 offers excellent feel--among the very best I've ever used, and I've owned A LOT of keyboards, including the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CM-Storm-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0068INSUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CM Storm Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyborg-V-7-Keyboard/dp/B007W81IC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyborg V.7 Keyboard</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G710-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B009C98NPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G710+ Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</a>&nbsp;and a few others. Of all of them, I'd rate the Raptor K30 the second best in terms of tactile feel and key response. That's pretty fantastic considering I'm comparing it to several mechanical keyboards that cost 2x as much. The only keyboard I've used that I like better is the CM Storm Mechanical Keyboard.

What makes the K30 shine? As many other reviewers have noted, the K30 has individual keys that stand above the keyboard and are not contained by a frame. This gives them a nice, robust feel and makes them very easy to clean. They also have just the right amount of resistance--they give solid feedback but don't require excessive effort to push. Space bar, the most used key of all, is solid and works perfectly regardless of where you hit it with your thumb. You'd be amazed how many keyboards have an uneven or sticky space bar. It's like making a car with oval wheels: I'm looking at you, Saitek Cyborg.

Writing with the the K30 is smooth and effortless. The keys feel precise and have a pleasing tactile quality.

Aesthetically, what some are describing as 'cheap' or 'unpolished' I find simply utilitarian. I don't need 'bling' on a keyboard. I need it to function perfectly 100% of the time. I need to NOT think about my keyboard. The K30 is simple, unassuming, and does its job.

The macros are great, but anyone that uses macros regularly already knows about AutoHotKey and uses that for macros within games or elsewhere. If the K30 is your first foray into macros, check out Autohotkey (freeware). The features of that program make 5 special keys that store a few macros seem silly by comparison. That said, they are very useful for one keystroke sequences for specialty tasks. At first the orientation (left side of keyboard) kept confusing me--I found myself hitting the ""G1"" instead of Escape. After a few days of use my hands adjusted and I stopped making that mistake.

The back lighting works well. I don't have a preference in color; red works as well for me as anything. If you have a strong preference, the K30 might not be for you.

The media keys are nice, but their positioning above the number pad makes them a bit awkward to reach. They're shallow keys and end up partially hidden by the number pad. With all the unused real estate at the top of the keyboard, I wonder why Corsair didn't put them there instead. It would have made them far more accessible.

It would also have been nice to receive black key cap replacements for the WSAD keys (they are silver-grey). I don't mind their coloration, but that would have been a nice touch by Corsair.

Another minor beef is that the led back lighting, when on lower settings, doesn't quite fully illuminate the text on the ""print screen"", ""scroll lock"", ""pause / break"" and other lettered keys. It makes the text on those keys look a little indistinct or blurry. With the brightness turned up to a higher level the issue goes away.

For the price, you'd be hard pressed for find a keyboard with a better overall feel than this one. No, it's not a mechanical keyboard, but it's also priced much cheaper. I have no problems giving this keyboard 4 stars and a solid recommendation."
27185,4,"What a cute game!  If you don't know, it's a Sim game based on creating a zoo that inhabitable for animals and fun for adults.  It's a little more realistic than the usual park games and not so tedious, either.
First the good:  the graphics aren't too bad -- they're just not like Quake.  The animals are very cute and when they have babies they're just adorable.  You have a number of additions to your zoo to decorate and entertain your audience.  Speaking of guests, that's probably one of the better points of the game.  In playing SimRollercoaster, I got very sick of how repetitious it was to send guards after delinquents almost every 5 minutes (meaning, it was just expected after awhile and got very boring.)  Here, the guests act more like guests.  You don't have mass riots break out (unless an animal escapes, obviously) and the most of you have to worry about is bathrooms and food stands.  Once that's in place, it's easier to concentrate on your exhibits rather than the fact that guest #1245 is pissed because there isn't any drink stand within 10 feet of him (although there's one 15 feet away.)  This isn't the case at all.  The guests roam around, take photos and buy stuff without vomiting or getting angry (like the system tells it to.)  It's a little more realistic and fun to play.
On the program itself, I was VERY surprised how well it loaded and how fast!  First thing it did was scan my system (quickly) to make sure I was compatible.  Usually with games, I have to run some type of diagnostic within the game disc, but this was different.  Also, it loaded within 10 seconds.  Most of the time, the games I buy take a full minute (such as the Sims or American McGee's Alice which takes a minutes inbetween boards)  I barely have time to grab a drink before it says: What do you want to do?
The downsides would be some of the glitches.  Very few, mind you, but they can be annoying.  I find that the keepers have a hard time walking -- period.  They sometimes walk in place for a second and my exhibits fill up with ""poo"" that they neglect to clean up right away.  But, I'm expecting a patch which I'm sure they'll put out sometime soon.  Otherwise, it runs just fine.  Makes sense, though if you think about it, here's a software company putting out a game that is directly compatible with their platform.  Who better to put out a game than a programming company?
All in all, cute game.  Very much an ""artsy"" type of Sim game where the player concentrates on the look and management of the park rather than the rides.  Pretty fun."
118049,4,"My entire family enjoys this game. Even my 13 year old son is having a blast.  My son, my husband, and my daughters ALL do yoga on the Wii fit as well.  Why?  Because they want to all be first on the rankings!

This is a great 'fitness' game that allows us to all compete with each other.  Yes, most of the games are single player, but that does not diminish the fun.

My husband was against buying this game as he thought it would be cheesy, and not much fun.  He admits he was wrong.

As for the game, I believe that the basic premise is to work on your balance and strength.  My children's balance (and therefore their posture) are all improving daily.  I never realized how important balance was to overall body health."
42726,4,"As you probably already know, Enter the Matrix is a movie liscensed game based off of The Matrix Reloaded. Many people who saw the movie were dissapointed because it was much worse than the first one. But, the game somewhat makes up for it. First off, I realize that many reviews from magazines and such have not been giving this game great reviews. This is because there are a lot of technical difficulties with this game, including it being short, having graphical problems, controls being fustrating at times, and there are a few glitches in gameplay. However, this game is great nonetheless.
Enter the Matrix is a fun-filled action game with a lot of replay value (there are two different characters you could play as). This game is purely action. Between driving cars and ships, shooting from turrets and cars, shooting with guns on the ground, and just plain awesome fighting, this game has a variety of different gameplay. It also has a fantastic story line if you like The Matrix series because it fills in many gaps in The Matrix Reloaded.
Enter the Matrix is a definite game worth owning for all action and Matrix fans. Just a few technical glitches keep this game from getting a perfect score."
184745,4,"Bought this a week after the game came out, played for 2 months, got bored of it.  Dont waste your money on video games unless your a hardcore gamer, this game is not worth it it will not last you long unlike first person shooters or RPG's"

258618,4,"Campaign was very fun but they took out multiplayer unless you have xbox live gold. If you do have gold you are able to create your own transformer. Also in campaign it is fun to play as the Dinobot Grimlock. You are able to buy 3 different Dlc for multiplayer mode the Massive furry which is fun cause it is huge and parts of it you can use is campaign. Havoc pack which is fun cause of Zeta Prime, Amd the one I highly suggest the Dinobot destructor pack which is awesome cause you get make custom dinobots Grimlock, Swoop, Slug (also known as Slag), and Snarl Unfoutunaltley no Sludge (you will find out why in the game.) Well peace out"
295286,4,"Edit - I had first rated this 5 stars but upon playing it again a year later i noticed a bunch of major flaws since the new patches. The AI during combat is glitchy, combat is glitchy itself and so is Edward's actions during combat (Edward will temporarily refuse to reload guns if enemy is approaching from afar, Edward will temporarily refuse to climb buildings if shot or stabbed prior, . Jumping from houses to trees or different obstacles is now a guessing game whether or not you'll fall to your death. The minigames are now almost impossible to beat and have 0 fun value. Everything has changed.

I would like to point out a few things that make this game amazing and some points that I think ubisoft should work on.
1- the graphics in this game are so pleasant to the eyes that you sometimes get the feeling that you're actually in the Caribbean. By the way the water flows and glows is breathtaking just to look at.
2- the game play is amazing and so is the storyline..although there's like 5 things going on at the same time its difficult to keep track of what's going on so you need to stay focused and actually pay close attention to the cinematic and there's a lot to read also.
3- the games longetivity is also amazing. There's so many things to do and so many locations.t this game will keep me playing for weeks
4- the soundtracks in the game are beautiful
5- everything you do in the game results in something else ..for example...if you like to hunt and gather alot of skin and bones from animals..that will give you material to make things like holsters and darts which will become necessary in many missions...attacking ships will give you a wanted level which will make hunter ships hunt for you...
6- the map is so massive
I think there's a few things that ubisoft can work on
1- there are some glitches in the game but nothing major like -it rains inside your compound when you approach the door but when you walk in there's no rain - when you kill guards in the water they jump up then float on top of the water -
2- there should be more weapons in the game..there are only enough that you can count on one hand..
3- when you upgrade your sword..it makes little difference in the combat and damage you do
4-  when picking up rifles or any enemy weapon Edward keeps dropping it at any action you do ( for instance if I'm picking up a rifle from the ground and I need to get high up on a rooftop to get a nice sniper position, you get up on the rooftop but Edward throws the rifle away)"
465760,4,"My best friend had the ColecoVision system and this is one of the games we played the most. I was never too good at Pac-Man but this game was very similar, though it was much easier to beat and outrun the cat. You could even trick the cat and trap it in a cube (with the doors that open/close) indefinitely so you could get the board cleared at your own pace. We'd trap the cat anytime we needed a break in play...not many games can do that! I also remember that the ColecoVision version had custom keypad inserts that slide into the control pad, that way you always knew which buttons did what at a glance, very good idea."
129385,4,"I have been REALLY playing this franchise since HSG3.  I love the mechanics and overall gameplay that spawned from this game and I have never regretted owning a single one.  That being said........

WHERE is the HSG I knew and loved?  This game plays like HSG.  It looks like HSG.  But it's NOT the HSG from before.  In many regards this is a good thing.  Sharper graphics that appear a tad less cartoony (although still firmly rooted in the anime style), the new advanced shot mode that really delivers the goods once you adjust to it, and all the clubs, balls, and customization one would come to expect from the HSG franchise.

However, they leave you with a feeling of a very basic game that was released before it's due.  HSG Fore feels like a better game in a lot of ways.  It made me laugh, even when I was ready to fling my controller out the window because of a crappy shot.  It felt deep.  It was a pretty game with serious golfing engine attached with some wit and humor thrown in.  And lest we not forget a LOT of various game modes, including mini-golf, which helped break up the mediocrity and the ability to have everyone unlocked before you even TOUCHED a tournament.  Sure this game a gorgeous and still a very solid golf game with an above average online mode, but the characters I grew attached to have been yanked, the humor all but gone (there's not a single caddy I can say so far that I am all that fond of), and the amount of single player and same console multiplayer modes feel like a ghost town.

As you can tell from my overall opinion of this game, I don't hate it.  I don't even REALLY feel like I wasted my money.  God knows it couldn't be further from the truth.  I really do like this game.  But I don't LOVE it.  My only hope is that enough people feel the same as I do and Clap Hanz and SCEA realize that while they took several steps in the RIGHT direction on one path, they shouldn't neglect the other path altogether.  A great golfing engine is only half of it and honestly, in this market, isn't enough to be a stand out title.  Bring back what made HSG stand out as a golf game.....  light-heartedness, humor, depth, and a wide array of golfers to choose from.

And in a PS......  I am having a really hard time getting my purchased add-ons to show up.  This could be nothing more than a PBCAK error (Problem Between Chair and Keyboard for the uninitiated), but there seems to be little out there to help me find help.  If I have to unlock them fine, but they should tell you that when you download them."
116922,4,One of my favorite DDR games.
6551,4,"The worst thing about Diablo II is that it is being called an RPG.  In  reality, it is a game about killing things--lots of things.  Don't get me  wrong, I love this game, it is addictive and satisfying, it just isn't an  RPG.
If you want to play a great game that is all about combat, dig in.  But if you want to play a thoughtfully put together RPG with a complex  storyline and depth of character, try one of the excellent games by Black  Isle Studios (Baldur's Gate, Torment, Icewind Dale, etc.)  Me, I like both."
51142,4,"This is a quality system. I have all 3 next-gen consoles and I find them to be very equal. They all have their pros and cons. Here are the pros and cons for the playstation 2 followed by a list of quality titles with brief descriptions:
PROS:
-Extensive library of games
-No subscription service for online multiplayer
-Nice controller
-DVD player
-sleak looking
CONS:
-You have to pay extra for a headset in online multiplayer games
-No subscription in online games means you have to put up with other players' lag, and deal with more little kids
-Many customers complain about the DVD player not working
-Only 2 controller ports
Games to purchase for PS2:
Grand Theft Auto III: A revolutionary action game which tells the story of some guy who got screwed in a bank robbery and ended up in jail, but he gets out and makes a name for himself in Liberty City as a criminal/driver. Very open ended gameplay, great story, great voice acting, great game. Some of the best car physics in any game.
Grand Theft Auto Vice City: Dubbed as one of the gorriest and most violent games ever, this game has earned its M rating. Set in the 80's, the player takes the role of Tommy Vercetti, the king of a Miami Vice inspired city (it's set in the 80's) when a drug deal goes wrong. You can fly helicopters, drive cars, drive motorcycles. It's pretty fun.
Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. A very good stealth game based on the Metal Gear franchise. This game has a very clean interface and contains many new gameplay elements for stealth games. The AI is pretty good up until they shoot you, where you can take almost a whole clip from an enemy and still live, then eat a ""ration"" to gain back your health instantly. Still great, still fun.
Gran Turismo 3: A-spec: I'm not big on racing sims because I know nothing about cars, but if your into that sort of game, this is THE racing sim to buy. Great graphics.
Final Fantasy X - An amazing RPG game from Squaresoft based on the Final Fantasy series. Probably the second best Final Fantasy game next to VII. I heard Final Fantasy VI (or III in the U.S.) was very good also, and I have it, but i never got a chance to play it. I like the characters a lot in this game. It's only downfall is in the voice acting of the 2 main characters. But otherwise, it's a pretty good game
Final Fantasy XI - Deviating from the classic singleplayer RPG experience Final Fantasy is known for, Squaresoft decided to make an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). I don't have this game but I've seen demos and heard good things about it. Unfortunately, like most other MMORPGs, you have to pay a subscription fee to play it.
SSX 3: Next to 1080, one of the top snowboarding games out there.
Devil May Cry: ""Though he was a demon, the legendary swordsman awoke one day to justice. Alone, he defeated the demon army and imprisoned their emperor, Mundus, saving the human world from damnation."" Sounds pretty cool right? It is. Very fun action game that melds swordmanship and guns.
Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando: A very fun platforming/action game that, unlike most platforming games, has weapons. This game is the sequel to the original Ratchet & Clank. I have not yet played this game, but am planning on purchasing it. I've heard only good things.
ICO - This game tells the story of a boy banished to a castle because he was born with horns. Soon after escaping from his ""tomb"" he was put in he meets a girl trapped in a cage and helps her along their quest to escape. Very clean animation, great water effects, and some of the best trees I've ever seen in a video game. Also, the girl, who speaks another language as ICO (the kid with horns) has very good AI. If you stop holding hands with her, she will wander around. She can also jump and climb ladders. I love this game.
Games to look forward to:
Final Fantasy XII - This game looks amazing, if you haven't seen the screenshots for this game yet, look around, they are jawdroppingly gorgeous. This game, unlike FFXI, is not online and follows the classic Final Fantasy singeplayer RPG drill. This game is set in the world of Ivalice, the same world as the one in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. It's shaping up pretty nicely.
Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake-Eater: This time, Solid Snake takes to the jungle where he can hide in the foliage and eat snakes and animals to survive. Very impressive.
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas: The next addition to the GTA series. Not much is known about this game, but due to the appeal of the last two, only the best is expected.
Nico: Sequel to ICO.
Grand Turismo 4: The latest addition to the GT series. Like I said, I'm not a fan of racing sims, but the graphics are turning out pretty nicely.
If you had to choose between one of the 3 systems to buy, I'd say they're all pretty equal. I would base your decision on which pros and cons you care more about."
21794,4,"it was an allright game fo the nes you play the role of vampire hunter simon belmont his primary weapon is the whip fighting through monsters & other spooky characters you can collect other sub weapons such as knife, boomerang & more some enemies are associated with halloween like frankenstein, grim reaper, dracula etc."
465025,4,"This game is like a lot of puzzlers: Addictive! Candy Crush, Puzzle Bobble, Tetris -- you can see where I'm going.  They are like a drug.

The only problem is moving the pieces with a tiny stylus. I have sizeable hands, so it's a chore for me."

43853,4,"its microsoft another bid on rts after age of empires and age of myhtology.well the basics are all the same,but where u had arkantos and joan b4 now we have nations.well at first it looked like u just got to build a few cities,make an army and capture the enemy capital.but when u play it in the tough and medium mode,thats when u have to be on ur toes.when to attach,how many cities and where,ambushes,openfield battle,engaging the right units with the right enemy units.and last of the campaigns in which u have to capture the enemy's capital is so difficult that u destroy some army buildings,and u lost half ur army for that,and when u look around they have created the same buildings while i was destroying them at another site.well i still prefer age of mythology as microsoft's best product,but uniting the whole world under one rule is kind of exciting.and yes the one blemish the thirteen different countries do have special advantages of thier own,but when u come out in the open everything is same for every country."
381914,4,"Solid build, but the Z button has a strange click that annoys my friends. Extra long cord and low price relative to original controllers makes it a great replacement for Wii and GameCube systems too."
236637,4,"I'm surprised.  It is fun to play despite what the negative reviewers say.

I've only played for an hour or two and I adapted to the mushy physics just fine.  Car handling requires some patience.  I crashed a lot in the beginning, but improved quickly.  I don't think the game is meant to be easy like some other arcade racers.  Maybe the control difficulty is intentional, maybe not.  It's OK.  Some cars do respond much better than others.  This is an incentive to go out and discover those cars.

I've experienced no technical issues.  It's pretty and runs smoothly on my machine listed below.  Don't know the actual frame rate, don't care.  All max settings at 1920x1200, except AA. 2xAA looks fine.

Cons: Environment lacks life, no pedestrians or anything.  Menus are not intuitive at first.

Got this and the DLC bundle on sale, so I have little to complain about.

35265,4,"I eagerly waited months for the release of Madden 2003. I have played the entire series from the beginning and consider myself a Madden guru. This review is for Madden on Gamecube, I have yet to play on any other system. Hmmm... Where to start? I am a little upset at the gameplay. Seems like my quarterback is afraid to throw the ball under pressure. If you like to throw alot you are dead meat on a good blitz. As for the running game, if you are playing against Faulk and Co., take the day off and go golfing. I have never seen so many missed tackles in my life! Linebackers and hard hitting D-backs are pansies in this game. My buddy did a fake field goal, my linebacker ran up to his KICKER, got a autograph or something, and let him run in for the 2pt conversion. I was amazed! Don't even let me get started on the injuries during a game! The graphics have improved on a plus side. And the training mode is pretty cool. If you are a beginner football player, this game will help you learn alot. I like the added plays on offense and defense. It does make the playbook very deep, and in theory should cover about every aspect of Offense and Defense.
 In a nutshell: I myself was looking for more classic Madden in this game. Why cant we bring back the ambulance to pick up the injured players??? I myself would like a better draft where the teams sit at tables like a real draft. I like the commentary better than last year. Its not AS boring. Anyway, I am getting angry thinking of how let down I am. I was looking for the BEST football game ever and didn't get it. I rate it 4 stars because I am a loyal Madden fan."

456013,4,good game
445944,4,Very happy with this product
76788,4,"It's a good expansion to a great game, too bad they turned the game into a farming game in order to achieve your ingame goals. Epic Flying Mount=farm your butt off, epic gear that you can make yourself such as 3 piece armor sets= farm your butt off..."
179749,4,"If you liked the original, this is more of the same. I was going to wait until the draconian DRM was patched out, but since Ascaron Entertainment had to file for bankruptcy I figure they got what was coming to them, and while the DRM is still present, the game being significantly cheaper than release. It is also an nVidia game, so those of us with ATI cards are SOL when it comes to all the PhysX effects (unless you cheat and do something nVidia doesn't want you to). Overall this game is much of the same that we got in the original, which includes the ability to focus in one skill and become all powerful."
246538,4,"It is good to get a Geralt fix; but, this follow up is not coming together for me as well as the original game. For starters, I had to use an old laptop to load the disks onto an external hard drive before installing on my machine. This was due to some dual layering that high end drives cannot read. Secondly, the Amazon code proved to be invalid and the Witcher servers are largly inaccessible - even after creating an account. Once you get past all of that and actually load the game, you are faced with a prologue that you probably will not finish on Medium setting unless you played the first Witcher. Even at that, I had to run in a circle shooting fire balls over my shoulder for like 20 minutes to beat one guy. The contracts I got in the first town are not going any better and the AI is non-existent. You stand at point A and monsters will ignore you - you stand a foot closer and they will attack!? Basically, you have to go around looking for glitches instead of strategies to beat  the tough battles. On top of that, Geralt deals a pathetic amount of damage. Maybe things will improve with subsequent levels; but, that is part of what makes a good game. Level progression should be better tied to the available quests. All in all, this game was not the breath of fresh air that an anemic PC Gaming community needs. Let's hope that Diable III delivers on that front."
87989,4,"Having played through the trilogy I feel that somewhere along the way the direction was lost. Xenosaga episode I introduced a vast and promising universe full of interesting concepts and characters and the promise of an in depth and interesting story. The first installment introduced everything from Realian rights, to discrimination; you even knew that the Seraphim Sisters were a popular girl group, giving you a feel of the setting that the game was to take place in. Sadly the universe that was introduced in the first installment has been methodically chipped away so that by episode III it has become the size of a person and that person is Shion Uzuki. A fair ninety percent of the game is focused on her and her far reaching effects on the world. The atmosphere of Xenosaga episode III was, I believe, supposed to have an apocalyptic feel, however, the impact of that was lost on me from seeing something that allegedly involves the fate of the entire universe from one person's point of view. There is too much going on in XSE III to be focused on one person for so long. Not only that it seems like an incredible waste to introduce so many interesting characters in episodes I and II only to shove them aside to focus on one and then to not only neglect characters that could have added an extra layer to the story but to introduce new characters who contribute nothing to the plot. I spent a majority of the game waiting for something plot wise to suck me in before finally admitting to myself that it wasn't going to happen. ""Plot twists"", revelations, and explanations are given in such a rapid succession that instead of being amazed at what I had found out I usually ended up rolling my eyes and muttering so what or asking do you really expect me to believe that?

It's a solid game even though the direction and execution of the story makes it fall short of what I expected it to be. My disappointment with it however still doesn't allow me to label it a bad game because it isn't which is why I have given it four stars. The battle system was fun and engaging to the point where I actually looked forward to getting into battles and the graphics were gorgeous. I have to admit that this is one of the most visually pleasing games that I've played all year. The dialogue however, is a mixed bag between thought provoking and unintentionally hilarious. While I was underwhelmed with the story it's still interesting enough so that if you're a fan of story driven rpgs that this is definitely something that you would want to look into, if you aren't already an initiate into the series.

Xenosaga does have a rather engaging storyline, but it didn't live up to the expectations that I formed upon playing episode I and even II. Perhaps my expectations were too high or perhaps I was led to expect something that never developed. Personally I felt as if it wasn't worth playing three games to get such an ambiguous and unsatisfying ending. I've played three games and not once have I ever gotten anything that even remotely felt like completion at the end of any of them.  This doesn't however mean that I hate the game, but I wasn't impressed with it either.  The writing, pacing, and direction felt too uneven, as if it was the result of a round robin with multiple people changing and adding to what had already been stated than as if it was a consistent campaign. Before any die hard fans get up in arms and decide that I didn't understand the story, let me assure them that I did. I just didn't care for the direction that was taken when there were so many other directions that the game could have gone in and left a more fitting conclusion than what was presented."
470835,4,"I purchased this game recently as I started to get into retro-gaming. I have to say that this was definitly fun, but with little replay value. The story is that in the future, which is now the present, aliens from planet x have begun to wage war on Earth. Somehow the Earth manages to send Godzilla and Mothra into space to fight off the hoardes of alien ships and their monsters.
Throughout the game you play as Godzilla and Mothra, you move across a hexigonal board for a set number of moves(Godzilla moves two spaces whilst Mothra moves four), and then move across the terrain in a side-scroller fashion, until either Godzilla or Mothra encounter an enemy monster, and proceeds to a fight. This goes on for about 9 stages, where you fight each monster over again, only with one monster added. Godzilla can punch, kick, tail whip, and use his signature heat beam. Mothra can fly over things, shoot a pellet that i suppose is the eye laser, and drops wings, which im guessing is supposed to be the toxic powder she creates in the movies.
The terrain ranges from volcanoes to jungles to enemy bases. Both Godzilla and Mothra must move all the way across the board and infiltrate the enemy base in order to move to the next level, that's pretty much all their is.
Overall, it's a fun game, but with little to no replay value whatsoever. I'd say it's only for the hardcore fans of Godzilla, or for Nes cartridge collectors."
150653,4,"I don't usually play horror games, but I had a great time with this one.  Great graphics, sound and atmosphere.  My only issue is that even though the story is interesting it was hard to follow exactly what was going on.  It could have been a more focused narrative and the ending leaves a lot to be desired."
101500,4,"Wheelman is a bit of an enigma.  Usually when games are bad, they're just BAD, not so bad they're good, as films often are.  It's hard to enjoy something that one could label as bad, as far as games go.

Yes, Wheelman has bad acting, bad dialog, weird mission structures, ugly faces on every character outside of Vin Diesel, but its also a lot of FUN.  And when it comes down to it, the fun factor is the number one reason a game is worth your valuable gaming time or not.  Wheelman is a ton of fun.

It's got ramps and destructible objects littered all over a massive cityscape.  It's also got a ton of side missions that offer a lot of replay value.  It's got your standard street races, but here you have a pistol that targets the 'tyres' of your opponents, and you can physically ram or dodge with your vehicle by moving the right stick.  It's got slow-motion shooting events, while you're still driving your vehicle.  You can play 'hot potato' and try to grab as many cases as possible and return them 'home' in a limited amount of time.  Sounds boring, but when some of the cases are located on the second story of buildings and you have to find a ramp to get to them, you have a great arcade mode that begs for a leaderboard companion.

It's also got a rampage mode (destroy everything before the time runs out), taxi mode, and several others.  The story mode is nothing special, but its still fun to progress through.  And the better you do on your missions, the more upgrades you can unlock.

The game threw in a ton of great little gameplay elements that street racers have been missing.  You're not just a faceless driver a la the Burnout series.  You have a character that develops and builds street cred along the way.

That said, the on-foot segments are pretty stale.  Just run and gun.  Nothing special.

Another point to mention is the 'T' rating.  Wheelman doesn't have the aggressive language, gory violence or sexual content that many other crime-based sandbox games (a la GTA and Saints Row) flaunt.  That makes it fun for teens or even preteens.  If you try to gun down a civilian or police officer, your bullets only push them away or hinder their movement.  No bloody deaths.  No deaths at all with the exception of other criminals.

It doesn't try to be everything to everyone.  No boring dating sims.  No complex sniping missions.  Just vehicle focused mayhem.  Great game, a lot of fun."
55675,4,It ok
383370,4,Works great and fits perfectly. Reads as about 95 to 100 blocks (bought a different one that said 256k and it read as 125 blocks). The only problem I have was the Turok 2 wanted to use 90 blocks of space to save. Ended up buying a second one just for that game. Most of my other games use 1 or 2 blocks.
305764,4,Just another call of duty game I suppose. It's interesting at first but you always have to get the DLCs
244267,4,"Unit is great for people that have limited space to play with their Kinect. Normally all the furniture had to be moved to play a game for a half hour. This would make you not want to play, but now its turn it on and go! Great accessory to an already great product."
215278,4,I like the songs better than DJ Hero. Better mixes. Awsome that you get to unlock Tiesto & deadmouse5. Great to play with friends combining guitar hero
298232,4,Good Graphics and physics are good ... flight controls are nice ..... I use my PS3 controller but if you want more control you'll need a flight stick ..... no cons so far... nice game play and the missions are challenging .......
406715,4,"Mostly works. When this thing works, its fantastic. I have my PC in the offfice and a TV in my room so this allows me to use a controller to play my PC games while I'm in bed. It does have some connectivity issues though. I haven't had it disconnect while playing, but there have been a few times where the initial connection from this device to my controller has been unsuccessful. After messing around with for a while it works long enough that this isn't a big deal, but it is kind of annoying."
464168,4,For a game it could be better.
327729,4,"While the Bioshock franchise will always be my favorite, I really enjoyed this game. It was a good mix of a first-person shooter as well as a sneak/stealth game. There are a lot of options for upgrading depending on your playing style. I especially loved the very stylized and gritty feel of the game. In a lot of ways this game is incredibly similar to the Bioshock games and I would recommend this (and I have already) to everyone.

The only downside, and why i downgraded it to 4 stars, is that it was just too short. The downloadable content does add a bit to the time you can spend on it, but I would have preferred to have more added to the campaign story line."
313718,4,Fun family time type of game. Kids enjoy it.
340942,4,"Work great, the blue one ripped the first day but only a little. It's held up since so I like it."
111319,4,"I especially liked that you could choose from 3 different levels of play.  There is a built in hint system, if you are roaming around wondering what to do or where to go next, a ? will pop up and give a slight hint, such as, look at the photos closer.  I need that in all the games I play. ha-ha  I would recommend this game."
263960,4,"Not sure what to say here. I'm not a gamer so I didn't activate all those buttons. A lot of buttons that I feel would get in the way if where activated. 11 total buttons. All though it does come with switchable parts that I just switched and it works a lot smother, still doesn't glide as well as my RAT TE or my RAT 3. The right and left click aren't as smooth or instant as I like. Comes with a pinky rest and 3 palm rest which is kinda cool and helpful to get the comfort you like. Comes with 2 other right side panels and come with removable weights which I took off and like better. You can also adjust the left thumb rest forward or backwards which is nice.
I got it because it looks cool and was the best match for my ASUS ROG G752. And I think MAD CATZ a good quality product. Just my opinion though.
I think it's a good mouse and would recommend it. I'm sure you can do a lot with all those buttons."
227526,4,"ok basically i got this game a while ago right when it came out i played this for days on end it IS HARD AS HELL at first but once you are used to it and find your niche then you can really enjoy the game the first part of this game is amazingly long but the second part only has one area and MAKE SURE YOU PLAY THE FIRST PART FIRST or you will be screwed on the second part
worth the price i honestly say you should get this game"
330140,4,Complex controll very nice graphics.
460119,4,"For Dragon Ball fans or just someone looking for mindless fun. This game is for you. It's a side scrolling beat em up where you can choose from the 3 main characters from Dragon Ball GT.

You can get upgrades, choose your path of levels (sort of like Star Fox level select) and the graphics are surprisingly good for the time.

I had fun playing this 10 years ago when it came out, a friend had it and I wouldn't be able to stop playing it. Bought it recently for less than $7 and it's worth every penny."
137290,4,"Valkyria Chronicles is a strange hybrid game - It's a turn-based RPG that fans of Final Fantasy Tactics will feel comfortable diving into at first, but it also incorporates some light third-person shooter elements. It's a strange mix that just works! The graphics are incredible and the music is great. The production in the voice acting and cutscenes is solid and the game itself is an enjoyable ride. Sega is kind of robbing us by not putting out another one of these on the current generation of consoles, and they refuse to release the third game (on PSP) in North America!"
177596,4,"This is a good stealth ninja game for the Wii but it could have used some refinement. The controls and graphics are pretty good but they could have been better. The Jumping with the C button is clunky, awkward and a hindrance. They should have made the character animations and movements smoother, faster, and more acrobatic (like a ninja). The sword fighting duels are really bad because there is not enough reaction time for you to get your sword in place. They really should have made the sword wielding controls better like Red Steel 2 did but this came out before that game of course. The plot could really use some work and this game has one of the strangest most shocking endings to a game that I have ever seen. The controls could be much sharper and the graphics could have been too (480p at least). There needs to be more enemy variety and the AI is sometimes laughably stupid. All the enemy characters have cheesy one liners that they say which really make you laugh. However, despite all these flaws it is very satisfying to kill enemies using the Wii Remote. Acquire Software is the same company that did the first Tenchu game and this is obvious when playing this game as the music, feel, and mood are similar to the first game. From Software also worked on this game and they are a Japanese Company known for making great games like Otogi, and Demon Souls but they have somewhat missed the mark here. The use of the Wii remote is a fresh idea, however the graphics, controls, and plot are all somewhat stale to say the least. Overall this is a good addition to your Wii collection if you are a hardcore Tenchu or stealth action game fan. Although Tenchu fans will be disappointed by the controls and really disappointed by the fact that the grapling hook is not even in this game. I would love seeing this series come to the PS3 with similar but more refined motion controls, full 1080p, a longer game, better voice acting and enemy AI, use of the grappling hook, multiple characters to unlock and play, and multiple online multi-player modes, character customization, and a dramatic and engaging plot. Is that too much to ask for??? lol!"
119225,4,Get this for the Zapper and not for the included game.  I played through once and was not impressed at all.  But I got Ghost Squad and it works real well with the zapper.
44886,4,"ATL:TOS is, at times, a very good RPG.  Unfortunately, ATL does feel like the generic equivalent of the Final Fantasy series, but it has enough creativity and character development to keep things interesting.

The story in ATL is mostly superfluous, but the character development is very well done and fun to watch.  In the game you play from two perspectives, Kharg and Darc.  Their stories become more intertwined as you progress farther into the game, sort of like Suikoden III.  The story itself is strictly generic; find elemental spirit stones to save the world from the evil force that wants to complete the ultimate weapon.  The fun part is the characters themselves.  Personally, I think one of the main characters (Kharg) is a tool, but his counterpart, Darc, is much more interesting and fun to play.  They share a light/dark and good/evil dichotomy, and Darc is the dark/evil part.  Much more interesting in my opinion.  The supporting cast is well done, too, especially the later characters in Darc's story.  I would describe the supporting cast as surprisingly creative.

Surprisingly creative is a good way to describe some of the monsters in the game as well.  There are some of the obligatory attacking birds and plants, but there are also some creatures you have never seen before, something that is becoming more and more rare in modern RPGs.

PROS: Decent graphics, creative character and creature design, addictive in nature
CONS: Generic story, generic feel to the whole game
Score: 4

325453,4,I had an invalid key at first but my problem was solved in a matter of hours. Very good customer service.
167273,4,"First off, this game is really fun. The game plays really well and the graphics are outstanding. The game is both Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale in the story mode which helps the game become even more fun. There is also some decent replay value with the single-player modes and trophies help the game too. However, this game only has online multiplayer. I have online, and it's fun, but what if you invite friends over? It's ridiculous how game developers now think that because the PS3 and Xbox 360 are out that no one cares about offline multiplayer! I really miss the fun multiplayer modes in Nightfire and From Russia With Love. If this game had offline multiplayer, it would probably be one of the best Bond games I've played. Overall though, I really like this game and will be enjoying the online multiplayer and wishing for more."
202091,4,"not bad not bad, but the creatures can run really freakin fast in this game makin it difficult to nail them."
247808,4,"This game is pretty amazing, so why would I give it 4 stars?
First of all, no replay value! I played this entire game and beated it, and I expected some reward for beating the game. But NOTHING!
And second, the game isn't really fast paced at all. The characters drive pretty fast, but not super fast like in other Mario Kart games. If you're really into that kind of stuff, by all means by mario kart 8 instead of this one. And If you don't have a wii u to play that, just buy this.

Overall this game is pretty good. 4 stars."
327079,4,"4/5 stars only because of the crazy high price. Otherwise, it works perfectly fine!"
119938,4,"The premise is very basic.  You're a new diver helping out with some oceanic exploration.  You've got to take pix, guide other divers, and search for elusive species, and the completion of these tasks earns you rewards like new gear.
While it lacks the action of side-scrolling Mario types, or the suspense of puzzlers like the Tomb Raider series, this game has a level of fun all it's own.  The learning curve is fast, the graphics are enjoyable, the quests are simple, and for me, the desire to complete more and more is pretty strong.
Overall, it's fun to just wander around and see what you can see.  It's exciting when you discover things like sharks, turtles, and even whales!
It's a great game to just escape into for a while to relax and enjoy the views."
101246,4,"Entertaining game, but very tough even on normal/default difficulty. Supports 1080P, but looks gorgeous even on 720P using Component Cable with a 2 year old Dell 24"" WS LCD that is not HDCP compliant. Audio is also very good. Gameplay is majority hack n' slash with very minor RPG'ish elements like most modern games, but still very enjoyable. Fetch a needed item and gain access to new areas, collect money to buy a handful of useful items, level up weapons, and gaining additional HP and ninja magic/MP is well incorporated into the game.

Rachel looks gorgeous, a little too jiggly exxxaggerated. Rachel's level are short, but also well incorporated into the game. I didn't care much for it, but still didn't mind it either. While Ryu controls well and is very responsive, Rachel is much slower and her attacks are easily dodgeable by quick foes. She seems to take more damage also compared to Ryu, but her life bar is based on Ryu's. If Ryu has used HP items that add more life bar then Rachel benefits from this as well. Her roped grapple sub-weapon is useless compared to Ryu's selection. Ryu also looks awesome along with the game's environment.

I never played the orginal XBox versions, but being a owner of several other consoles and handheld I was not deprived of similar games. To me this game is not the best hack n' slash adventure game ever, but a darn good and entertaining one still though. The game did not look as smooth as I was hoping for, especially for a game that is a few years old and started life on a weaker console. Anti-Aliasing seems to be only 2x, and their is noticeable lag randomingly even when not a lot is happening on screen. I'm not sure about the 60 FPS standard promised by Team Ninja or Tecmo, but the game does not always run at that frame rate. Game camera is also not very good at auto lock as the play moves around so much. Camera can be the cause of death a lot of times. Several bugs, but on rare occasions only. Load times can be terrible between gameplay and cutscenes (CS). On a few occasion the screen turns white and takes over 10 seconds to load a low resolution pixelated CG or in game graphic CS. The game locks up randomly and I never know when it locks up due to differing load times. I wait for a couple minutes and if nothing loads I reset the game, but again a rare occasion. On my PS3 this only happens with NG3S, which should have been more polished prior to release. Not a great XBox port to the PS3. $60 + tax for a decent port that didn't include all the original content from the previous XBox versions on a Blu-Ray disc and all new content is weak on the dollar value scale. I was disappointed when I read about the unlockable contents from the original XBox versions like the original NES playable series and a movie mode (CG & cutscenes viewable probably).

I also thought I would be able to start with the equipments I had once I completed a difficulty like Devil May Cry series, but not the case here. Start a fresh game on a different difficulty setting with nothing, but experience from the previous play through. Fighting techniques and moves are unlockable so your favorite slash attack is locked again once you restart another adventure. Rachel's wigs are locked away again, which the hard work to unlock in the first place was not worth it. Her adventure is short and unlocking accessories and hairstyle/wig is not really necessary nor worth it a second time around. I'm currently playing through Hard mode and I actually struggle less compared to my first time through on Normal mode, but still a tough game. I would consider this a rental if you are a decent casual gamer and just want to complete this game. The length time for this game is moderate, but once through the replay is very low on the value scale. I mean unlocking new customes doesn't make the game any more different or enjoyable and not having the ability to swap between customes at will once a new game is started is even lamer. Even PSOne games like Resident Evil allows custome swapping during game. With very little to no interaction with NPCs and going from fight scene to the next becomes repetitive like most games in this genre. Overall, buy this game if you enjoy challenges and hack n' slash'em adventures. Otherwise, rent it and be entertained a one time through."
275442,4,"fair graphics,easy to control using a mouse, easier with the mouse than in the blazing angles, city interactive is always a good basic game group.

494300,4,"A little too much in the way of repetition, and one too many loose ends for my taste (I mean, if you're going to have 9 separate paths, you'd think you could clear up all the loose ends across those paths...)

But the three protagonists are fantastic, and generally the game's concept is very cool. Also, fantastic soundtrack by Kevin Penkin."
371644,4,"Having played all versions of Doom since I was 7 years old, this is a fantastic installment. While it doesn't have the ""freak factor"" of Doom 3, it definitely has that Doom flavor. Nothing more satisfying than blowing away the forces of hell with an arsenal of weapons and finding secrets along the way. If you are looking for that thrill factor of being scared while playing like in Doom 3, that doesn't really exist here. There are a few parts where a demon will spawn right in front of you and startle you but thats about it. Its a true run and gun game.

Pros:
Very Nostalgic. Love the old guns as well as the new ones. The chainsaw is rather satisfying
Fast gameplay. The game moves smoothly and I sensed very few framerate issues.
Campaign and story seem to make sense. Unlike some newer games that just throw you out there, this one you can actually follow.
SNAPMAP. Didnt think this would exist on console seeing how cumbersome the controls would be but glad its there. Gives you the ability to play custom maps and modes with friends created by you or others in the Doom community.

Cons:
Graphics. I was looking forward to seeing some hi-res graphics, but the game simply didn't provide it. It you step up close to a wall or item, there is very little detail. The monsters look great, but the death animations get repetitive.
No coop. In a day where consoles are 10 times more powerful and games coming out are saturated with coop theme, I think it was rather poor that the campaign doesnt have the option of coop. I realize none of the other installments did, but I think that would bring Doom up to another level of excitement.
Multiplayer. The traditional multiplayer was completely vanilla. Nothing special at all and the shotgun just needs to go. Although playing as a demonspawn can be cool.

All in all and 8/10 for me and I would recommend it to someone looking for that run and gun game."
128071,4,"Good headset nice mic, picks up a  lot of background noise though. I don't really see much point in buying this over a normal headset but I liked the wireless feature and I didn't need a big headset."
448609,4,Gosh I gets to control mari o and don't loose him you still have at least sometime to catch him.
248671,4,"One star ticked off because I wish this game had more updates, hell, even some DLC or something. That being said, everything in the game is great, the new mechanics are awesome and the customization is a big bonus to the Kart franchise. Awesome overall."
35279,4,"SOCOM: US Navy SEALs is definitely one title that belongs in your collection. For one thing, the graphics are jaw-dropping. The visuals, textures, and character models are all highly detailed. Another is the gameplay. If head-shots are your favorite, have at it. If you prefer all out gunfights, there's plenty of that too. But if stealth tickles your fancy, try clubbing someone in the face w/ your rifle butt or slashing throats from behind; it's really stress-relieving! The sountrack usage, if I may, is similar to MGS2:SoL. The music remains quiet until you're spotted. If an enemy sees you, the music picks up into a fast-paced, adrenaline pumper.
One key feature in this game is the use of online play. You can play online w/ up to 15 other people on one of 16 game maps. One downside to this, however, is that broadband internet is required. An upside is that online play is free, that's right,
F-R-E-E!
But you don't have a broadband connection (me), the single-player missions are enough to satisfy you for a while. Especially because you'll be replaying alot of those missions over and over! Yes, this is a, in some parts, VERY HARD game. The difficulty is the only reason that I gave this game 4/5. The added headset which allows for the verbal issueing of orders is a nice little incentive, and allows for communication between teammates during online play. All and all, this is a very fun, fast-paced, violent, and HARD game.
I would recommend this game to anyone who has patience and about 2 hours worth of level replay time. Not recommended for those w/ anger management problems. If you do not have patience, you will go through about 4 broken Dual Shock 2's before you beat the game! And probably about ($$$$) worth of new living room floor."
204275,4,"Same thing as ultra street fighter
1.online matches
2.get everybody's ending
This is basically all you can do."
370091,4,"I think this game is very underrated because of other moba style games recently published after Battleborn.

It is depending on the community and sometimes it is hard to find friends to play with but the game itself is well thought and structured.

Gameplay is balanced and you can learn it easily.

Since it is my first experience of MOBA on PS4, I had some difficulty to get used to play this with gamepad but it only took 1-2 hours."
308528,4,"I'm not sure why this game has gotten such bad reviews, but I don't think it's bad at all. I don't think it's the best sonic game out there, but it's very far from being one of the bad ones. It's definitely not as fast paced as some of the classic Sonic games, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I like the fact that you can take your time exploring and how the gameplay can change from stage to stage. For this game they decided to try out new game mechanics that other platformers use which I think makes the game more appealing. The controls could use some fine tuning (thus -1) but apart from that I'm happy with my purchase."
330163,4,"This game is a visual masterpiece, game play is great, there are a few minor flaws

Pros
-as i said earlier the game is maybe the most beautiful game visually ive ever seen
-cars are easy to control and have great controller feedback
-you don't have to repair your car each time
-you could play this forever and still have stuff to do
-different views
-tracks were artfully crafted
-multiplayer is fun

cons(just a few)
-for some of the really dope cars you have to buy like a 20$ dlc pack, which is dissapointing
-the music is kinda weird for this game (its like classical and an opera singer, weird)
-i feel like when ever i play this game i play it for a week non stop then stop playing for about 3 weeks and then play for another week straight, it can get kinda boring
-not that many tracks

tip: play this game with your lights out, it makes the expirience a whole lot better

overrall an a truly great game"
96583,4,"This is as close as you'll get to the DualShock 3. Maybe if the DS3 hadn't come out when I bought this, I wouldve given it 5 stars, but I would pick the DS3 over this. The L2,R2 button are hard to get to because the battery pack is in the way, and the D-pad feels kinda cheap. The analog sticks, and the action button feels better than the dS3 and I love how they light up. THe price that you buy this for really depends on how you appreciate it. If you get these for [...] bucks, I would say, save up for the DualShock 3, but if you pick these up for $[...], like I did during the black friday sale, I would say they're woth every penny"
21072,4,"OK, the graphics are absolutely stunning, but that they were already in Riven. The only real apparent technical progress (and not the least, mind you) is the 360 degree view, which lets you immerse into the breathtaking sceneries of six (or more acurately, five and a half) different ages.
The puzzles are in the same logical vein as usual, but sadly I didn't find them very challenging and I was able to finish the game in approximately 12 hours, which is much less than what I was expecting from the creators of the Myst series.
As a whole, Exile is a wonderful game, mysterious and beautiful, and the music sends you directly into another, totally magical dimension, but if you've already played its prequels, no doubt you'll be left begging for more. My guess is that people with less experience in the Myst universe will enjoy it much more. I can only recommend they play Myst and Riven (in this order) too."
132757,4,"So I boarded the Mass Effect train recently when I found that the series was making the jump to the PS3. Because Mass Effect 1 is so low cost these days or that people love gifting it as well, I found myself with a copy and decided to play it, so that I would be able to experience Mass Effect 2 in its full glory.

Mass Effect 1 is essentially an amalgamation of a third person shooter with RPG elements, such as leveling up characters and applying their status points to numerous stats.  It was my first time experiencing such gameplay and found it pretty interesting and fast paced.  I relied on the autolevel up mechanics for my character and then other characters that one can have in their parties for speed of play.

Characters can also specialize in one of multiple types that affects their gameplay, however if they reach a high enough level then they can become a master of say, multiple weapon types instead of just the one for their class. Players can also specialize in combat, biotics, and tech that all affect gameplay such as being able to bear different armor and use different weapons, to being able to hack and disrupt enemies.  Finally the cast of AI players that join the player on the story can also specialize in these types, so it provides a bit of various fun in choosing the AI characters for an assignment or mission.  Gameplay also afford players with the opportunity to man a vehicle for some missions, and others have some aspect of a time limit imposed on them.

The story spans one of trust, betrayal, and seeking to save the day. Through moral actions chosen in dialogue players can go on to perhaps form relationships with their crew, perform good deeds to gain more paragon points allowing them to convince others during cutscenes to do their bidding, or be a total renegade and kill characters. These decisions ultimately leave one wanting to save at every scene and just watch them over again if they did a different choice. Or it makes one want to play the game again and see what changes.  I can say that a decision at the end of the game makes me want to see what will happen if I change.

Ultimately the game is fun in what it achieves and is a great RPG for the stars, the game has great graphics to this day, and is fully voiced (even its robust codex with primary information), and with its interesting moral system and wide scale multi galaxy wide storymode, a joy to play. The game can be completed in just 14 hours if one only does the main quest and maybe one or two sidequests though it easily provides double that time if every assignment is explored (and these have voiced acting too). Definitely check it out!

*its aso available through STEAM"
55527,4,Pretty good game.
15161,4,"Metroid is one of Nintendo's most popular franchises in the world today. From 1985, it has appeared on almost every Nintendo console released to the world and continues to evolve in terms of style, art direction, storyline and game play. While you can play the very first installment in this great series on the Wii via the Virtual Console service, most people who had the NES experienced it right here.

You take control of Samus Aran, a female bounty hunter, who travels throughout space to help maintain order between the planets. Your mission wass to find and destroy Mother Brain, an evil entity out to take over the world with her army of various aliens. Back in 1985, this game blew the doors of what a contemporary game should be. Much like Super Mario Bros. set the standards for the once popular but now almost non-existent platform game, Metroid set the standards for the adventure genre with its branching paths to different worlds, various power suits and weapons. Without a map to rely on, you basically had to use your memory to find your way around the game. As you acquire these suits and weapons, you become stronger and can access certain rooms and gain entry to certain areas. Some of these are out in the open while others are concealed within the walls themselves so prepare to shoot your weapon everywhere. You eventually get to the last world where Mother Brain resides and fight it out until she's defeated.

Just about everything about the game was and still is solid. The graphics, while primitive compared to today's standards, was top of the line as it was one of the launch games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The sound effects and music captured the mood while you're playing. The controls were responsive and do exactly what you wanted. The story was pretty basic but you got over it quickly. The game was pretty long so there was a password system in place. Whenever you die, you were given a password that you can use later to continue where you left off.

This game was perfect for those who played it in its original cartridge form. It had been re-released later on with a different box cover, then ported to the Game Boy Advance and was included as an unlockable extra in the Gamecube title, ""Metroid Prime."" Go play this game if you want to relieve good memories or if you haven't played it to begin with, see how it all started. ******HIGHLY RECOMMENDED******"
122734,4,"Brutal Legend is a fantastic journey into a video game representation of the heavy metal music genre starring Jack Black and the legends of the art form in a madcap adventure that combines elements from a great many styles of gameplay to make for an unforgettable (albeit brief) gaming experience for fans of heavy metal.  Newcomers to gaming might be put off by the RTS learning curve, but veterans should have no trouble adjusting to the multiple game types.  Virtual explorers will have plenty of ground to cover and hidden treasures to search for and there is even multiplayer if you feel like battling you Xbox Live buddies for metal supremacy. Given the extreme brevity of the game, I'm glad I got it for only $20; but at that price it's well worth it since this is the kind of game you are going to want to play more than once. Brutal Legend opens with one of the funniest cutscenes ever. While watching this brutally sweet intro, you have the options to PG-13ify your gaming experience to bleep out the swearing and do away with the dismemberment. If you are a loser, that is.

Eddie Riggs is the best roadie in the business, but he is not pleased with today's popular metal scene. He longs for songs about vikings and album covers with demonic monsters on them and singers who shriek as if they were being dragged into the bowels of Hades. Well, he's about to get his wish. Finding himself transported to a savage land filled with demon nuns, rocker chicks, and medieval weaponry, Riggs finds is true calling when he encounters a group of human rebels waging war against the Tainted Coil race of demons. All they need is for somebody to show them the ancient power they lost. The power of METAL!  Brutal Legend is really more like 5 games in one. It's a hack-and-slash action game that has Eddie wielding his two weapons (guitar and battleaxe) to mow down the baddies with cold hard steel, pyro, and of course, heavy metal thunder. He gets around the world in his highly customizable hot rod The Demon Plow (affectionately referred to as The Deuce) which he can summon anytime by busting a sweet guitar solo. These solos are activated in a Guitar Hero-like sequence of timed button-presses and serve many purposes throughout the game from uncovering relics to delivering orders to troops or slaughtering large groups of baddies (by melting their faces, see). The landscape is littered with side quests that earn you Fire Tributes (aloft lighters), which indicates favor with the Metal Gods and is used for currency to upgrade your weapons, abilities, and vehicle. Waiting to be uncovered in every corner of this epic land are chained stone beasts who will grant you power and tales of the history of the world you now inhabit if you can figure out how to release them. Plus there are bonus songs and powerful new solos to discover and unlock. Most of your time will probably be spent just cruising around smashing random hordes of demons and staring at the amazing landmarks while you search for more hidden hotness. Exploration is very important in this game.

 The meat of the game's primary missions revolves around the ""stage battles"", where Eddie sets up a rock show war machine to run the enemies of their group Ironheade out of town. These large-scale battles are a simplified version of the classic real time strategy format, but can also incorporate the other aspects of the game for a unique experience. Flying above the battle on wings of a demon, Eddie can summon and give orders to his troops or he can get personally involved by kicking tail on foot or in The Deuce. He can also activate powerful double-team attacks with any member of his army, which is very cool. My personal favorite has to be the mosh attack, where Riggs thrusts a devil horns hand sign in the air and calls his troops to gather around while they bang their heads in unison and bowl over enemy infantry. It makes for a very cool and funny gaming moment. Brutal Legend has a lot of those. Over the course of the game, Ironheade will not only take on the Tainted Coil, but the evil forces of Lionwhyte (representing for hair metal) and the emo/goth-tinged Drowning Doom. The way these armies and their leaders are presented is extremely satirical and is a blast for music fans familiar with the countercultures they represent as they trashtalk their way through each fight.

Now all this is well and good, but what really makes the game a must is the story, the cast, and the music. Sadly, the story is short enough to easily play through in one sitting, but it is funny enough that you'll want to play it more than once and you will have to spend significant time to see everything there is to offer. The soundtrack is MUCH longer than the game and I still haven't heard all of the ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN songs included. The music is a diverse sampling of various styles of metal featuring everyone from big names like Black Sabbath and Rob Zombie, serious death metal like King Diamond and Loki, 80's pop metal from bands like Def Leppard and The Scorpions, industrial from Ministry and KMDFM, power metal from Dragonforce and Manowar, and a hell of a lot more. Naturally, the metal gods who lent their voices to the game also lent their music and Jack Black's folk/metal band Tenacious D is on hand, of course. The way certain classic songs are used in the narrative is pretty awesome too. Now, I keep telling you about how great the characters voiced by the legends of heavy metal music are so you're probably wondering who they are.  Well, do you want to lead a cadre of headbangers flanked by Lemmy and Rob Halford on choppers to smash up an emo pity party?  Yeah, you do.  Do you want to ride out of the underworld with a brand new batch of weapons while Ozzy shouts ""Go f@#%ing CRAZY!"" after you?  But of course. Sadly, the late great Ronnie James Dio was stricken from the game due to a tantrum by a certain Prince of Darkness (or more likely, his wife) and his absence in this is HUGE. I'm sure Jables was devastated by this criminal omission and the fact that I played Brutal Legend mere days after his passing didn't help. Still, Dio or no, one cannot underestimate the awesomeness of battling a giant chrome spider to secure the steel webbing necessary to string Lemmy's bass so he can heal your Lita Ford-inspired ladyfriend (Ford also voices a character). That's right: Lemmy Kilmister's bass-playing heals the sick in this game. I always suspected he could do that. The story is only a few hours long, but its' packed with awesome and a surprising amount of emotion for what is essentially a spoof. The game does a masterful job of slowly introducing the various elements and it never gets particularly challenging on normal difficulty. The only way I really died is by carelessly driving off of a cliff (or ten).

My biggest complaint with Brutal Legend is that it feel as though it's just getting started when it's already over. By the time each game element is brought to bear, you are at the final confrontation and already anticipating the next big battle that will never come. This is just plain wrong. There's only one battle in the whole game where you have your entire selection of units to utilize. What the hell? On the other hand, multiplayer allows you to challenge the computer or another player to rock as many stage battles as you like as either Ironheade, the Tainted Coil, or The Drowning Doom, which is an excellent addition. However, the difficulty is ramped waaaaayyyy up on these so the clumsiness this RTS veteran showed integrating into the different aspects of the main game's stage battles did not go over well.  The multiplayer AI plays to win. All in all, the only real problem with Brutal Legend is it's extreme brevity and failure to integrate the entire world into the story. If you want to see all of the great metal-themed visuals, music, and powers that the game has to offer you are going to have to spend a lot of time just driving around. The main game's stage battles are few enough that it feels like they are more of a tutorial for the multiplayer (which is NOT the reason to get this), and that's a big wrong. But still, at a discount price and with all the great music and heavy metal coolness of this game, it's still a rockin' way to kill some time."
121408,4,"This game is actually scary, it is not like Resident Evil 4 or 5, it actually has suspense. The graphics are great and dark(going great with the whole genre), the sounds are perfect voice acting makes it seem very real. The cool thing is the guns and your menu, instead of it being a real menu, it is a virtual screen! For only 20 dollars you can enjoy this game for hours, and with the new one coming up I would guess you NEED to know this story-line before continuing with the second one.

Great game, and only 20 dollars! If you just got a ps3 and are looking for games that are just under the 40 dollar cap, perfect.

Just make sure this isn't for your 5 year old son."
120158,4,"The Good: Flawlessly executed, lots of guns, huge world, lots of missions, neat art style, addictive, awesome co-op

The Bad: Almost no story or dialog, repetitive, short, art style is wasted on bland environments

The newest RPG hybrid is probably FPS hybrids and since these are so new Borderlands can be considered one of the first to perfect it. While Fallout 3 holds the crown let's just say Borderlands is the prince. If you have had a hard time grasping FPS/RPG hybrids then let me put it simple for you.
Like in traditional RPGs you have elemental attacks. In Borderlands you have these and they consist of corrosion, explosive, fire, and lightning. Some guns can be fused with elemental powers so i.e. a lightning combat rifle will deplete enemies with shields faster than just a normal rifle. A shotgun with corrosive powers can kill creatures faster than a gun with lightning powers.

Another element that you should be familiar with are stats. Just like TRPGs Borderlands has damage, hit accuracy on weapons. You get shields that have certain aspects such as when they deplete they send a wave of corrosive acid, or they recharge faster, or give you a health boost etc. You also get grenade mods which change the way your grenades act just like guns. There are also specific class mods that can increase some of your stats even further. Additionally, each character has a specific ability they can use and you can equip special spheres that add attributes to this ability. Sound like a TRPG so far? What about enemies? They too have levels and shields and the damage you deal to them will bounce off of them in a series of numbers along with the experience you get once they are killed.

There are a lot of little tidbits such as the money system, you can purchase items or upgrades at vending machines, saving clap trap robots can give you more storage space, there are healing items, when you kill an enemy you can loot them, you can also loot the dungeons you enter or the open world. See, it still sounds like a TRPG. What makes it different? Just add guns, a vehicle you can drive and shoot from, and a fast travel system. The way to play in all this fun is co-op. More players+harder enemies=better loot. Good math in my book.

This sounds fine and dandy like nothing can go wrong, but Borderlands has its issues. While the game play is actually pretty flawless with lots of guns such as rocket launchers, combat rifles, SMGs, and revolvers etc. The content is very thin. There isn't much to do, but run around the barren wasteland completing the 150+ side missions and 50+ story missions. There is hardly a story or any dialog. You're just running around trying to find this Vault with some special treasure. All the loot is the same and even the storage bins you find them in get's boring to see after awhile. While the game has a pretty neat cartoony graphic style everything is brown and boring and it makes the neat art style put to waste.

The difficulty isn't something to complain about since it increases as you level up. Each area has to load separately and the load times are longer than they should be. Most of the side missions vary from scavenger hunts, to killing people, looting, and more killing, but the core game play is really shallow, but the stuff it's wrapped around is flawless. This game is really meant for people who just want a straight forward shooter with some more depth and a twist. While it does feel more arcadey than Fallout 3 and more pick up and play it just doesn't have that charm and amazing feeling to it. Borderlands is executed well, but just needs more filling to make it superb. However, the game is highly addictive and even though you know you're doing the same thing over and over again you never get tired of it. The game has a level 50 cap, and can be completed 100% in less than 20 hours, so Borderlands is a great purchase for any shooter fan."

150173,4,"The extended battery is great. Props to Sony for bringing it back.

PACKAGING 5/5 -
  The packaging is different than what is shown. It's now a more aesthetically pleasing plastic box.

PERFORMANCE 5/5 -

I've been playing my psp on the original slim battery and it only lasts about 4 hours. Then I started using this and it's a huge difference. I've been playing MLB:The Show 2009 for 2 1/2 hours a day for 4 days and haven't had to re-charge it. The battery meter shows 20%. I couldn't do that with the slim battery.

AESTHETICS 3/5 -

  The extended battery kit comes with 2 battery covers: Silver and Black. Since I have a Daxter silver psp, I used the silver cover. The matte finish doesn't match my glossy-finish psp which is dissapointing. I feel if the cover was glossy, the bulkiness wouldn't look as bad. The black cover has a glossy finish so I don't understand why the silver doesn't.

COMPATIBILITY -

  I've been hearing that if you try to use a PSP-3000 battery in a CFW-enabled PSP-2000, it will screw it up. That's not the case with the extended battery. I thought maybe Sony discontinued these batteries so they could ""fix"" these to prevent CFW-enabled PSPs from working. Glad I'm wrong. Also, the box mentions the battery works with all PSP models.

Overall, I would recommend psp owners to get one even if they don't do much traveling. The added weight makes my psp slim feel like an expensive product rather than a cheap toy."
408733,4,"This is a solid game.  Graphics are just below top notch.  Story line is compelling and the sound while wearing a pair of immersive headphones is also very good.  (Notice none are the greatest hence 4 stars not 5).  The mechanics of the game remind me a great deal of of a cross between Far Cry and Watch Dogs, so if you like those games I don't see how you will not enjoy this one.

Just a solid game that does justice to the franchise.  Pick it up, you won't be disappointed."

380572,4,"Update again after requesting warranty service from Razer.  After a 2 month RMA process, they actually upgraded me to the Razer Trinity which appears to be a significantly improved design of this mouse.  Happily restoring to a four star review but caution to all buyers that you're investing in a defective design on this version.  Razer still makes the best mouse when it comes to pure form fit and function as there is still nothing quite like this on the market.  Recommend upgrading yourself to the Trinity as well, or be careful about the mouse button breakage issues on this version.

Update after about 1.5-2 years ownership:  The left mouse button cracked from fatigue, right by the corner of where the scroll wheel is.  Pressing in that location can no longer trigger the left mouse button.  I will attach an image to show the point of failure.  Docking two stars, I've never had a mouse fail like this before.  I don't have a heavy trigger finger nor do I travel with this mouse, so there's really no reason it should have failed so early in its life.  I'll try to contact Razer to see if they will replace it... will happily restore to 4-5 stars if they do.

Update after ~1 year ownership: Software issues went away after I turned off updates and left the Razer Synapse software at version 2.20.  No more intermittent connectivity.  I now reliably use 5 out of the 7 thumb buttons hundreds of times per gaming session.  I don't really use buttons 6 and 7 at all, so I mapped them both to the Alt modifier, but haven't really bothered practicing to use them (though I'm 100% sure I could if I wanted to).  Buttons 1-5 are absolutely reliable for me and I can snap to them lightning fast.  This mouse is really impressive and overall a huge tactical advantage in various MOBA style games.  Still going strong, no issues with reliability or buttons not working.  Bumping up my rating to a 5/5 because it is still one of the best (if not the best) on the market for MOBA games.

Original review:
After being a long time user of the Logitech g700 for DotA 2, I really wanted an extra button or two on the thumb (I use the thumb buttons for activating item slots and frequently have 5 or 6 usable items).  The g700 has extra buttons for the pointer finger to the left of the LMB which are useless to me, they were way too difficult to hit reliably. This mouse was the first one I considered for replacement due to the layout and simplicity of the buttons.

I will say 7 thumb buttons is a lot of buttons.  They are definitely less reliable to hit compared to the g700 thumb buttons, which nest your thumb very well for rapid deployment of all four buttons almost simultaneously and very accurately.

However, if you can live with a few extra milliseconds between hits, definitely worth it to have the extra buttons.  I still haven't mastered hitting all 7 reliably.  I struggle with button 7, usually biased toward buttons 1, 2 and 4.  I will say buttons 1-4 are very reliable for me and almost as fast as the g700.

Comfort level is 10/10 also, by far the most comfortable mouse shape I've ever used.  Soft touch surfaces are excellent as usual from razor, especially the pad between the thumb buttons and the pinky/ring finger rest.

Docking 1 star for the Razer software which has caused me a lot of problems, including issues recognizing devices intermittently, and at one point I had to reinstall the software because it wouldn't launch without errors.  Logitech software ALWAYS works, by comparison.  Also no device side storage of the key mapping/profile."

40836,4,"The game's premise:
Aliens invades Earth.  Earth counterattacks the aliens, and destroy some of their spaceships.  The 'juice' that leaks from the aliens' spaceships give rise to a whole new threat to Earth's existence: giant monsters!
Anyways, you initially start off with a cast of 8 playable monsters - each monster starts off with 2 different costumes you can choose from.  Later, you can unlock 2 more costumes for each character.  In addition to that, you can unlock 2 extra monsters.
To ""unlock"" a feature, you have to play the game in either Adventure Mode or Endurance Mode.  The further you progress, the more ""tokens"" you'll get.  And with those tokens, you can purchase (""unlock"") extra features such as Maps, Costumes, Characters and Mini-games.
There are two problems with unlocking items: the unlockable items are WAY TOO expensive, and most of the extras are WORTHLESS.  I'd definitely pass on purchasing the mini-games because they're ridiculously boring.  And 2 of the unlockable maps are horrid.  As for the extra costumes you can purchase, SOME of them are cool-looking...but they're all horribly overpriced.  With the current pricing of unlockable items, you have to beat the game way too many times to unlock all of the extras.
Or shall I say ""most"" of the extras?  (aside from the maps you automatically win in Adventure Mode)
There is one other extra feature out there that can't be bought: and that's Sweet-tooth's costume for Magmo (or whoever that was).  In order to ""unlock"" this extra costume, you have to go out and BUY ""Twisted Metal: Black,"" and beat the game with every character, and then save it to your disk.  Whoever thought of the extra-features is, simply-put, a complete imbecile.  That's the nicest thing I can say about the extra-features.
I'm going to say you'll only like this game if you're a fan of giant monster movies like ""Godzilla,"" ""King Kong,"" ""Rodan,"" etc...if you're not, then you'll probably find this game a bit repetitive and lackluster (because it is).  If you ask me, the controls are way too simplistic.  Also, there's way too much of a generic feel for the buttons/contols regardless of the monster you pick.  If I was grading this as a regular videogamer, I'd probably give it a 1-star rating.  But since I'm grading this as a lover of monster movies, I'm gonna give this 4 stars since I can't seem to find any game like this on the PS2 devoted to giant monsters..."
108352,4,"Earth is invaded by aliens at the same time strange crystals arrive and provide nourishing radiation to Earth's baddest monsters, who in turn become the planet's best defense against the alien attack.  You control Godzilla on his different missions in cities across the globe, as he tries to save the world.

As silly as that introduction sounds, the actual game is even cornier.  But people don't expect Dostoevsky when buying a video game; people attracted to the Godzilla games want monsters, mayhem, explosions and brawls.  Godzilla Unleashed delivers.  The gameplay is free-roam fighting, allowing players to kick, punch, and use special powers for dozens of characters.

While the marketing of the game focuses on the storyline, most people will get their most enjoyment out of the brawl mode, as friends and family select different monsters and have at it, Mortal Combat style.

This game delivers what is expected.  The variety of monsters and arenas allows for months of fresh gameplay.  Some may think the monsters are a bit sluggish, and maybe this game isn't the ideal match for the Wii remote, but overall, it's a solid game."
76097,4,"It's not a masterpiece game, but Land Of The Dead: Road To Fiddler's Green is a good game. The graphics aren't that good at all, but the gameplay is cool. I was expecting more, but this is the best you'll get for a game that wasn't really talked about.

220305,4,"The standard XBox 360 controller really is the greatest gamepad that was ever created. I recommend getting a battery pack charger alone with it though so you don't keep burning through AA batteries.

My only problem with it is that I keep wearing out the thumb sticks. But going with off-brand has been fruitless. This official unit really is the best bet despite.

I got a wireless receiver for my PC and use this for steam games as well. If you do that, buy an official one, the off-brands have driver problems that have given me more than a few headaches."

421705,4,Good game.
434771,4,"I never played Sticker Star, but a lot of people say it's a better version of that approach. I knew going in that the battle system was consumable (via collected cards), and that the game had points you couldn't skip. For instance, the paint bucket named Huey (very clever) constantly wants to remind you that you can use UP on the D-Pad to summon him for help. Once or twice, or a reminder here and there, ok, sure. But it's nearly any time he pops out at certain trigger points in the game to give you a clue. LOTS of hand holding in this one. Also there are times when everything is happening on the gamepad, so onlookers just see an uninteresting screen with abstract designs of color, not the actual fight. Very odd choice indeed for Nintendo. A simple ""look at the gamepad"" overlay would have been fine for first-timers.

This is a definition of what is currently wrong with Nintendo and what is currently right.

Wrong: Game has excessive hand holding, and a painfully long process for a simple battle. It does indeed feel like a chore to fight in this game. And if you have the wrong cards for a boss, forget it. You're dead.

Right: Graphically this game is gorgeous. Hilarious writing make this game a must play for any fan of the series.

Just don't go into it with Thousand Year Door expectations. Think Super Paper Mario (Wii) meets Sticker Star (based on what I know about the consumable battle system). My advice, wait for a deal on it. Not worth $60."

Well impressed with how much this thing can track and from my understanding its going to be improved with new games.  I don't have any children, but i could see kids really getting into this.  From what I have noticed is adult non gamer women love this as its easy to learn and its like dancing.

+ A must buy if you have children / grandchildren or a girlfriend / wife.
+ Has voice control while watching a movie. No more having to get a remote / controller to pause a movie.

- Not a lot of games.
- Its watching you all the time even when not being used."
216400,4,I got Velevet Assassin awhile back as part of a sale that had it going for 1.79. Easily making it the best bargain ive gotten in quite a while. While the game lacks the graphical polish of its big budget competitors Velvet Assassin is a fun stealth game with an engaging story and gameplay that truly tests your mettle. Any fan of the Splinter Cell franchises or WWII-esc games should fork over the 7 dollars they are currently charging.
234306,4,"Story mode review only since I have yet to play the multiplayer. If it's anything like the Brotherhood multiplayer I'm in trouble cause I was addicted to it like crack! :) Especially the Wanted mode.

First off I'm a huge fan of the series starting with Ezio's journey in AC II. Ezio D'Auditore is probably the best developed character in games right now and in AC Brotherhood you saw him come into his own as an Assassin. In Revelations he has aged into a wise Master Assassin who's barely lost a step.

The game was a little slow to start but once you got into the groove it was fascinating and fun. The addition of the hook blade brought enough change to getting around and fighting without messing with the overall fight mechanics, which are outstanding. Traversing Constaninople was a breeze while rooftop free running and using zip lines to speed things up. It doesn't get any better than doing an air assassination off a zip line!

Pros:
Graphics: The graphics are top notch as always and you will enjoy climbing towers just to see the sights below.
Combat:  The addition of the hook blade was very well done and adds a different dimension to combat and getting around. You can now craft different types of bombs to use in different situations or just to have fun with. Nice addition! I especially liked the poison bomb that had everyone within the blast area flailing away like crazy before they dropped.
Story:  Seeing Ezio as an older Master Assassin still doing his thing, getting more insight into Altaire's life, while also  continuing Desmond's journey is enough to keep you wanting to see what happens next, just like a good book.
If you're a history buff the story while fictional includes historic figures which you can learn more about in the database. Ubisoft goes through great pains to make sure the locales and landmarks are portrayed accurately. I actually enjoy going through the database and learning about the real people, places and things in the time period. Who new you could learn some history from a video game?

Cons:  Just some minor ones which can be avoided if you like.
Side Quests:  Some are fun some are filler. Most are optional. You can go back and do them after the story mode.
Den Defense mini game: You may like them. I didn't care for them. I played the first one which is unavoidable and didn't feel it fit well. You can avoid them by not letting your notoriety meter fill by bribing heralds and the like.

Bottom Line:
A great addition to the epic franchise that won't let you down. Dinged it one star because it was a tad shorter campaign than I expected and I didn't care for some of the filler.

As a bonus you get the first AC for free which I haven't played yet. At 40 bucks plus a free game it's a steal. Looking forward to AC III!"
379677,4,"I bought an Xbox One bundle a few weeks ago, and after a few days with it, I felt that there was just something missing.  Scrolling to the one guide or through the settings, there's just so much more your Xbox can do.  I have to say, I've always thought the Kinect was a silly novelty accessory, but I found myself wanting my Xbox to control my tv and satellite, and wanting to use voice commands to control my Xbox.  Sure, I could've bought the IR cable for $20 for the tv/satellite features, but that wouldn't allow for the voice commands, so I picked up a used Kinect for just $45 more.

After setting it up, I have to say it definitely adds to the experience.  Perhaps it's not a vital accessory, but it's a really useful addition.  I love that the Xbox can log me or my guests in via facial recognition, tell me what shows are trending, what's on my favorite channels and my apps like Amazon and Netflix, rather than having to scroll through all those channels and apps separately.  I can turn the Xbox on and off, change the volume, pause, play, fast forward and rewind, snap apps and switch between different games and tv just by telling it to do so!  Maybe the motion tracking camera isn't all that necessary, but it's certainly not a bad thing to have.

Now, the Kinect is only as good as the features & games it enables, so I tried out some demos and found that Disney's Fantasia for the Kinect 2.0 is an absolutely outstanding game.  I bought it almost immediately (it's very cheap on Amazon).  It's a phenomenal game, fun and accessible to adults and kids alike.  I cannot recommend it more emphatically!  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that there are many others that really take advantage of (or even support) the Kinect, though Battlefield 4 has some unique features.  Dance Central however is rather spotty at best in its tracking ability.  The game is actually pretty decent (though the dance moves can be pretty silly), but the menu is terrible to navigate.  My used Kinect did not come with Dance Central Spotlight, btw.

In conclusion, as a mandatory $100 accessory, I hated the idea of the Kinect.  But as an accessory that can be picked up used for around the cost of a game, I think it's an accessory that most people would benefit from, and I strongly recommend it!"
235091,4,"From start to finish Modern Warfare 3 has me hooked to the story and the fast paced improved multiplayer. The Campaign is very exciting and it is very long too which is something I love. It is 17 missions to be exact. If you have played Modern Warfare 2 you need to at least rent this for the campaign because this might be the last Modern Warfare. The campaign has a certain feel to it that no other game is able to match. The slow-mo shooting, the ""OMG"" moments that makes your jaw drop, and the wonderful graphics that are hard to say are better than Battlefield 3 but have at least improved to a satisfying point that any Call of Duty fan will love. The multiplayer is much better with new game modes, kill streaks, maps, better servers, and very addicting. The guns are very different from MW2, BF3, Black Ops, it is something completely new. The guns are much better, cooler, and updated. The only gun to come back is the UMP and it is 1 of the guns you start out with and will probably want to end with if you used it a lot in MW2. It is probably the best sub machine gun, but not the best gun. The new thing that I absolutely love is guns ranking up. Every time your gun ranks up you get something new. An attachment, a perk for the gun, a camo, it makes the game better for people who stick to the same gun. The perks are mostly the same except for overkill which allows you to have 2 primary weapons which is good for someone who snipes cause he can also use an assault rifle or any other gun they want. The maps range from very small to large and they are all very fun and easy to adapt to. It seems kills are easier to get in MW3 and it is much faster than MW2 or BF3 but that is a plus for me. The new kill confirmed game mode is extremely fun for people who hate snipers camping. Every time you kill someone you get xp, every time you pick up a dog tag you get xp and a point for your team. It is a very smart idea and is very fun. Overall this is a great game and is a must play for people who love fast paced multiplayer games with lots of kills, quick scoping, and a exhilarating campaign."

405164,4,"Nazi-killing goodness.  There just went several hours of mein leiben (my life, if you don't get the old Wolfenstein joke.)"
250650,4,"The Good: Beautiful visuals, engrossing story and character, fun and fast paced combat, varied locales, challenging boss fights, choices make an impact on story, compatible with AlienFX

The Bad: Very linear, loot isn't very good, predictable enemies, boring cut scenes and dialog segments, bad partner AI, issues with AlienFX

Dungeon Siege is one of the fathers of the dungeon crawling genre on the PC. There's just something addictive about running around smacking everything and trying to find the best loot. Don't forget about challenging boss fights though for the best loot. Dungeon Siege III continues this tradition with an engaging story, interesting characters, and beautiful graphics. The game, however, falls flat on a few notes.

You get to pick a character amongst four with their own unique background story. I chose the Lescanzi female that uses guns for combat. I got a long-range carbine as well as a pistol and shotgun combo backup for close range. As you run around killing enemies you can use a variety of powers that use focus, and you gain this by killing enemies and hitting them. Think of this as mana. Then you have power orbs you can use for special attacks, but these only regenerate when enemies die. These powers vary by character, but they are essential for winning battles. I found combat to be fun an addictive here, but I never really felt I had the upper hand. I ended the game at level 35, did 99% of side quests, and still struggled through some tough fights. I had the best armor and weapons, but always I was struggling. Using my offensive, defensive, and passive powers really helped for healing, staggering enemies, knocking them back, and slowing them down. If you play single player you get a partner (Anjali the fire archon), but there are some problems here.

The game is best played in multiplayer, but the single player AI for your partner is touch and go. When you fall you don't die until your partner dies, but they can revive you. I had issues where I was in tough fights and she just kept fighting and never came to heal me, then she became overwhelmed and died. This was frustrating because you revert to the last save point, and long boss fights towards the end can make you tear your hair out in frustration. However, the game would be impossible to play without the revive feature so I am grateful for that.

Exploring is very linear with a few branching paths, but at least you won't get lost thanks to the quest line you can pull up and follow around. Besides, going off the beaten path isn't worth your time because there's no ""major"" loot. Every chest seems to have a few various items and some gold. The armor looks great and shows on your character visually, but most of it was junk. Unless you access a new area the shops will have poor armor, but rarely did I get one that boosted every attribute. Usually I had to sacrifice attack power for more armor, agility for will, elemental damage for will, and so on. Where is all the good high level armor at? It doesn't really exist, and enemies drop armor and weapons that are worse than what are at stores. Dungeon crawlers are all about the awesome loot and Dungeon Siege III is lacking it.

At least the story is interesting with your character trying to recruit legionnaires to stop Jeyne Kessynder's army. There is dialog choice that affects how the game turns out, and these actually meant something. A choice early on can make a boss fight later easier. My only problem here is that the conversations are dull because you just stare at the characters and usually skip most dialog. The voice acting is good, but that's no excuse for dull ways of doing dialog. Between each chapter are hand drawn art slides, but they are ugly and I would have liked to see some nice pre-rendered ones.

The graphics are gorgeous with great lighting effects and high-resolution textures. The locations vary immensely and you always look forward to seeing what area you will be in next. The music is great as well with beautiful orchestral scores the follow in your footsteps. Dungeon Siege III is worth the bargain bin price these days, and dungeon crawler fans will have a blast here with challenging boss fights, and varied locales to explore. Don't expect great loot, or even varied enemies because the enemy setup tends to be predictable. Dungeon Siege III is a fun dungeon crawler, but could have been better.

Note: The game is compatible with AlienFX for those lucky enough to own an Alienware computer. When you health bar is green all your lights are as well, same when yellow, and then red. This is really neat, but the problem is there is a delay for some reason and it was never patched. Your health will be red, but then your lights are still green. This only happens some times, but nonetheless, it is a cool feature."
268221,4,"These grips are ok, but they're a little small for my hands (XL glove size) and the triggers are a little sticky. not too bad mind you, but I liked the CTA grip alot more because I have direct access to the shoulder buttons, and the grip is bigger and more comfortable to me.

These were still good grips though, just not for me. I'm also about to pick up the Hori grip that just came out, just to try it."
252147,4,"Out of the box, the stick leaves you wanting. the xbox button layout is all mixed up, its really light so tends to move even when placed on a table, the stick's deadzone is too large. But after rearranging and rewiring the buttons, adding additional weight, and adjusting the deadzone and adding a stiffer spring, it feels great! So if you to mod the stick, then its a good choice. Out of the box, not so great."
187485,4,"I play Madden almost exclusively online against human opponents, so if you prefer single player action, or the Wii specific party modes, you will probably want to skip this review.

I'm not sure why AE has so much trouble getting this series nailed down, especially for the Wii.

They seem overly concerned with finding a unique Wii look.

Visually, Madden 08 looked great, with a good sense of realism. But it looked just like the other Madden offerings.

Madden 09 was a huge step backwards visually, opting for a an old style Nintendo look that really turned me off.

Madden 10 was a compromise of sorts. The backgrounds were much more realistic than in 09. The players look more cartoony. The camera movements are more creative. Overall, I would prefer they went back to the 08 look, but the new look is not bad.

But enough about looks. Playability is far more important than appearance, and in this respect, AE got Madden 10 right. And the single most important feature AE added was long overdue -- that being a control scheme that takes advantage of Wii's controller.

Before Madden 10, the Wii version used a scheme similar to the PS3 and XBox 360, requiring fluency with myriad combinations of buttons. The few Wii specific controls  were frustratingly unpredictable; they seemed to be added simply because AE thought Wii users loved to pointlessly wave their arms around.

Madden 10 introduced a point-to-pass scheme, which is much easier to learn, and which feels much more natural. Old schoolers will stick with their familiar controls for a while, which they've mastered over years, but I've seen even the most conservative Madden players switch to point-to-pass. The system may not be perfect yet, but I'm convinced it is the way of the future. As much as Wii players envy the superficial look and the depth of programming in XBox/PS3 Madden games, they can take pride that only the Wii has this revolutionally control scheme.

The online play modes are much less buggy than in previous versions. Cheaters and cheasers will be frustrated as they try to gain unfair advantages over opponents. Connections are rarely lost. Unfortunately, players may still quit without punishment, so many games will end against the computer.

The gameplay commentary is by far the worst of any Madden game I have played. The problem isn't with the announcers or the comments themselves (except that I wish John Madden himself spoke once in a while), but with the complete mismatch of commentary to actual gameplay. Touchdowns are declared when a run goes for a loss. Great defensive stands are touted when a play goes for a TD. Quarterbacks are confused with receivers. I'm guessing the commentary works in single player mode--otherwise, I can't imagine how these errors made it through game testing.

Many other areas of online play were improved, including the challenge system and player controls. Some problems that appeared initially were fixed with player updates, which occur during every online hook-up.

Even the Wii Madden is not the best game for gamers who just want to dive right in and play well. New users will feel humbled for a while as they learn the system. But with the first win will come addiction."
426381,4,"A very fun play through. However, I wish that the game was about me traveling with a group of characters and interacting with them instead of me traveling by myself like the Fable series.  Still, it was a fun play through."
360933,4,I would give it a 5/5 had the online multiplayer worked right.  I play halo for the online experience and im let down on that part.  I am sure it will be fixed though here soon. overrall the campaigns are worth the price of the game.  you get four great games remastered. once the online is fixed ill bump my review up to 5/5  I would still recommend people to get it but if your expecting to just jump right in online then I would wait until it gets better which should be here soon.
93141,4,"I had initially bought a GameCube controller so I could play GC and Virtual Console titles, but after giving games like Street Fighter and F-Zero a try with the GC controller, I felt there was something missing. I immediately placed an order for the Classic controller and after trying it, boom! I was magically transported to my teenage years playing all those great games with a controller that felt right. I could finally do a Shoryuken as easily as I did with the SNES controller.

The only two reasons that I did not gave the controller 5 stars were because I think the controller is a bit bulky, it's bigger than the SNES controller, but that was a minor issue. The other thing, which is also not a big deal is the cable coming out from below of the controller, not from above. But just move it out of the way and you are good to go.

Aside those two issues, the controller is a great way to enjoy the VC games. I recommend it."
441272,4,"Incredibly fun game which adds a very welcome twist to the FPS genre (giant robots, called Titans).

My only real complaint it that cheaters have not been as aggressively targeted (for removal/exploit fixes) as they have for other games."
169807,4,"I bought the Wii Rock Band 2 guitar/drum/mic/game kit from Amazon as well as the standalone RB2 guitar (for bass).  I assumed the two guitars would be the same, but there are a couple of differences.

The first and most notable is the finish, the kit guitar is black & white while the standalone is sunburst.  Not a big deal, actually I kind of like the variety.

The second difference that you won't figure out until you start playing is that the frets (not the strum bar) on the standalone guitar click, while the kit guitar does not click.  I don't think this necessarily affects the ease of playing this guitar, but after playing the non-clicking kit guitar for a few hours, switching to this one feels kind of weird, and it *feels* like you have to work a bit harder to hit the buttons.  Probably just my imagination though, as my score does not seem to be affected by which guitar I use, but it might bug some people.

Also note that I may have just got a bad guitar, perhaps it is not supposed to click."
378464,4,"Case fits the new 3ds perfectly. My only complaint is both pieces are not together, so it can come off fairly simple. It doesn't seem to protect much, maybe just scratches."
242738,4,"Im use to playing games like Skyrim and Bioshock infinite, my 2 favorite games for XBOX 360.. and this game follows along kind of like those, open world with a good storyline.  Its no Skyrim, not that open of a world, but its definitely a solid 4 star game with good weapons, its a unique game on its own.  If you are tired of the same old Call of Duty games, pick this up you won't be disappointed.. its not a 5 star game in my opinion but a lot of games out there are boring this holds your attention, give it some time, don't judge it by the first few missions, because you don't even get a gun right away.  Its a great game to play while waiting for the next Grand Theft Auto game to come out in September, another open world game."
457336,4,"Good condition, not great. Loving the game so far."

293179,4,ok
13573,4,"I'll make this review short.
The graphics are increadable with cel-shaded models (for that cartoon look) and has 5 huge cities with little slowdown at all.  Fun to play, easy to beat (but I'm glad to go though it another 3 times), and has one of the best soundtracks this side of the planet.  At $(...), I see no reason why you shouldn't go to the local store and pick up a copy.  Don't buy this if you plan on doing your homework."
261511,4,"I like the feel of the keys and the size. It is great for gaming... when it works.

Occasionally the keyboard becomes unresponsive. At first I thought it was my computer, since unplugging/replugging the USB cable usually cleared the issue. However I have discovered that all I need to do is turn the keyboard upside down and give it a gentle back and forth shake it to get it to start working again. Will continue trouble shooting, next step is replacing the cable.

Update: It was the cable. Keyboard was otherwise fine and I have not additional incidents. I have increased the rating to reflect the stellar performance, but it does not get a 5 since they shipped me a bad cable."
246248,4,Find it quite challenging and difficult.
55248,4,"I've never been big on first-person shooter (FPS) games, although I've played a few, like Star Wars: Battlefront 2, that I've found entertaining. So, getting this game was taking a chance, since I'm partial to real-time strategy games and roleplaying games.  Overall, I must say that I've really had a good time with UT 2004. It hasn't made me more of a fan of the FPS genre, but I am definitely looking forward to UT 2007.

Gameplay: The controls are the typical mouse, WASD keys, and hotkeys associated with FPS games, so anyone familiar with the FPS genre ought to be able to jump right in. You have a number of options for your in-game character, including race, gender, name, etc. You can also choose your AI teammates and the number on each team.  Additionally, there are ten game modes, including deathmatch, capture the flag (CTF), domination (requires you to hold two points), assault (objective based), bombing run (a deadly version of soccer), and onslaught (securing nodes and destroying the enemy base). There's fun to be had with each mode, but I suspect that most people will find the greatest replayabiity in the onsault, assault, CTF, and team deathmatch modes. The maps are large enough for some strategic thinking (especially on assault and onslaught), and the game comes with about 100 maps--with many more that can be downloaded from the internet.

AI opponents (""bots"") are very good in this game. They have strong attack scripts, good pathfinding, will follow orders, and generally work well as teams. I detected some of the typical AI cheating found in FPS games (i.e., extra health, amazing accuracy, accelerated movement) toward the end of the tournament and in some of the tougher matches, but generally the AI here is just plain challenging and well programmed. Although many will buy this game for the multiplayer side, the single-player content (which is all that I play) is quite strong. The game does not have a compelling story to tell, but the tournament mode lasted me 25-30 hours on ""experienced"" difficulty level. I don't feel a need to replay the tournament anytime soon, but there are a lot of individual maps and modes that are greatly replayable.

A few things that add a lot to the game are the variety of weapons available and the vehicles. Overall, none of the weapons are very overpowered, though some are better and more versatile than others. Some weapons are best suited for one situation, while others can be useful in some fashion under a number of conditions. A second element that adds variety to the game is the vehicles. I can't overemphasize how fun these can be. Not only do they break up the monotony of having to sprint on foot across the map, but they also add a new strategic and tactical layer to a game. Vehicles can be game winners, but they are not invincible. Some can carry multiple passengers, who can man various weapons or simply go along for the ride. However, to maintain balance, characters on foot have a few very strong anti-vehicle weapons, and many objectives cannot be completed by vehicles. Still, there's nothing like decapitating a fleeing opponent with the blades of a Scorpion buggy or hearing the thundering cannon of a Goliath tank.

The gameplay is frantic, exciting, and straightforward enough to appeal to a range of gamers. You never feel lost on the maps, since there is a good in-game mini-map and the objectives are always clear. Also, you never get the sense that you are babysitting your computer allies, since they act as intelligently--more so on many occasions--as the average human player. The game's flaws are mostly minor, but worth mentioning. First, there are a few rather frustrating missions in the tournament that the average player will have to repeat several times (at least on experienced difficulty and higher). And there is no way to adjust the difficulty level of the tournament once it starts. Also, the game-save system is automatic; the game saves after every match, win or loss. Thus, you can find yourself broke if you lose enough matches, and you'll have to play a series of qualifying matches to earn enough money to continue the tournament. It's a system that gets old quick and really adds a layer of repetition to the game that serves little purpose. Finally, some people will be put off by the amount of acrobatics that the game includes. On some of the more advanced levels and difficulty settings, AI opponents are hopping, flipping, and cartwheeling in ways that make them nearly impossible to hit, though they will seem to hit you just fine. I think that the game plays just a tad bit too fast and requires too much jumping around. But you'll get used to it.

Graphics: Great-looking game. The maps are very impressive in detail and size. Be sure to take a lot of screenshots! The models are all rendered well, from the characters to the vehicles. Weapon fire and particle effects look good, as does the natural environment, especially skies. Have no doubt about it, this is a very violent game. Dying animations are graphic, and people tend to end up in pieces or as skeletal remains. Overall, the art direction is rock solid.

Sound: Although decent, the audio is not as good as the visuals. Weapons such as miniguns and tank cannon sound like they should, along with footsteps, flowing water, and other ambiant effects. In-game AI characters tend to use the same list of taunts such as ""Ownage!"" or ""You suck!"" or ""You be dead!""--along with a few choice obscenities--but none of the characters really stand out with individual personalities. The music is the typical techno fare found in many video games, nothing special.

Documentation/Stability: The manual that comes with the game is informative and makes up for a rather bland in-game tutorial. The game was pretty stable on my computer, though I experienced one freeze and one crash during the tournament. Overall, the game seemed well polished and optimized.

Replayability: Given the number of maps that come with the game, the developer's Bonus Pack that can be downloaded for free from the internet, the large number of player-made maps available, and the editor tools that you can use to make your own maps, this game has had a long shelf life. If you get tired of playing against the AI, you can go online and play against a human opponent. For me, about half of the 10 gameplay modes are not appealing after a few rounds, but the other 5 (especially assault, onslaught, and CTF) are always good fun.

If you are a fan of FPS games, UT 2004 seems to be a must-buy (I'd be surprised if you don't already have it!). From what I have read, it is the best of the Unreal series and still has an active online community. For those of us who only have a passing interest in FPS games, this is a good one to blow some time with."
20437,4,I wish this game would take itself a little more seriously. It is a little toony. But fun and challenging and that is what counts.
122354,4,This is a decent game.  The graphics look nice and the games plays smoothly.  It is not my favorite type of game but I did enjoy playing it.
84795,4,as expected
198622,4,Great
103690,4,"Very fun, long game.

The stealth action and open world style are really rewarding."
114519,4,"I like this game. It has great graphics, the replay mode is like watching the race on TV but better because of the different angles and a nice collection of vehicles. If you like racing sims, get this one."
169225,4,"It was a pretty cool game, but very poorly optimized for PC. I originally bought this to mod it and loved how customizable the code was. Sadly, even without mods it still lagged on my relatively mid-end PC. But at your own risk!"
41291,4,"This latest entry in the Command and Conquer series will, unfortunately, probably be the very last as Westwood was just recently amalgamated into Electronic Arts.
In accordance with this amalgamation, the plotline for this game is radically different from its predecessors. The Brotherhood of Nod have been replaced with the GLA, while the US and Chinese armies have taken the place of the GDI.
The storyline for Generals is an uncomfortable reflection of real life events, with GLA terrorists invading middle eastern nations like Baghdad and Afghanistan. Naturally, the Chinese and the US are out to stop them. The parallels are a little too close to reality, and this does remove some of the fun and campiness from the game that were often present in its predecessors. Red Alert 2 was a delightful example of this.
This is also the first C&C game that contains more than 2 sides, which makes for some rather entertaining skirmish and campaign missions.
The US uses a combination of air power and ground forces to crush their opponents, with very little emphasis on ""weapons of mass destruction"". Instead, the player would be wise to use precision airstrikes and artillery to crush their opponents.
The GLA have units very similar to NOD, in that they are fast, light and mobile. This makes them very useful for ambushes, but they become expendable in prolonged skirmishes. Their greatest strength lies in the effective use of suicide bombers and toxic bio-weapons. The GLA is a good side for those who use stealth to defeat their opponents.
The Chinese use overwhelming numbers and firepower to defeat their enemies. Fans of the old ""tank rush"" strategy will love playing as the Chinese, especially as Chinese tanks get attack bonuses if they are grouped in large enough numbers.
The graphics in Generals are easily the most impressive of any entry in the C&C series. The game makes excellent use of 3D-accelerated graphics to render huge maps consisting of mountains and flowing rivers. Tanks will raise clouds of dust as they move across desert terrain. Jet fighters will execute tight banking turns as they engage a target. Most impressive are the super-weapons, like the Chinese Nuclear missile, or the GLA Scud Missiles.
The most glaring downsides to this game are the portrayal of the GLA as your stereotypical Arab terrorist. This may be particularly offensive to members of the Arab community, with
its (hopefully) unintended racial stereotyping. The apocalyptic end cutscene of the GLA campaign will certainly not help matters.
In addition, some users have reported compatiblity problems while running Generals on their PC's. Please check the internet to ensure that your PC is compatible with the game. Also, be warned that this game does require an extremely fast PC. I have an Athlon 2000+ XP with 512MB RAM and a 64MB GEForce4 videocard, and I can run the game in 1024x768 on high detail. Anything less than this, and you may have problems.
Other than this, Generals is an excellent game. Yes, other than the updated graphics it doesn't present any revolutionary innovations to the RTS genre. However, for those of us who enjoy the fast pace that the C&C games provide, this is a perfect addition to the series.
Although the impact of Generals will not be as great as the original Tiberian Dawn or Red Alert, Generals is still one of the most polished entries in the series."
172445,4,"this is a great sonic game, but it could of been legendary. sonic 3 was split in 2 pieces. sonic and knuckles was the other halve. sega couldn't meet the ""Hedgehog Day"" deadline, so split the 2 up. if sega thought this over, they would've seen that it was stupid to do this. split them up, just to reales sonic 3 on Groundhog Day. if sonic 3 and sonic and knuckles were together, the reception of the game would've made up for this and exceeded the sales of sonic 2, which is the best selling game for the genesis with 6 million copies sold, but with them seperated, sales between the 2 total 4 million. but since you can combine sonic 3 and sonic and knuckles together to get the full sonic 3 game, you get the lengendary game you should of got back in 1994. if you own a genesis, get this game as well as sonic and knuckles."
125224,4,"This game in the daddy of action meat headed gaming and I love every bit of its meaty headed goodness (killzone 2 says hello also).  The storyline in the game has plenty of holes in it so good luck on that part.  The game play is Gears of war, great mechanics better enemies and the stages are awesome (not a fan of the worm stage but I understand) Great buy!  Replay value is great because of the Horde mode, the multi player has all the glitchy goodness you expect from a Gears of war game so expect some unfair craziness when you play multiplayer VS."
265398,4,"Well, this is indeed a fun game. This is not a simulator (like Forza or Gran Turismo) but is more like a mix between Ridge Racer, Burnout and Need for Speed, and it's tons of fun, it doesn't have like a story mode like Need for Speed but it has plenty of modes to keep you busy and the cars are cool to look at and drive, graphics are not awesome but look good enough, it runs smoothly and action feels awesome, there are plenty of scenarios and a lot to unlock, so bottom line you will not regret this purchase if you are looking for a good arcade racer. I feel satisfied. :D"
24942,4,"Okay,
  First of all I am not a hardcore fan of any game. So, I don't expect anything to follow up in a sequel. To be more specific, I have never played a MGS before MGS2. But, I love the game, and I have no problem with the main character RAIDEN and not SNAKE. I mean come on if a game uses the same person it gets repetitive.
Anyways, I bought this game because of all the hype, and I must say wow. This game continues to amaze me. The graphics are great. The gameplay is like what a shooting-strategy should be and not just another kill all. However, there is one thing I don't like is having to constantly skip dialogue and movies after I beat the game. The first time I played I was glued to everything but now I just have to skip it all. All I have to say is if you like 3rd person shooter-strategy play this game before you label it. I mean sure you don't get to play SNAKE but a game isn't just about the character. Thats why its such a great game. It's setting it self up for a new era of MGS's with RAIDEN and its doing it the right way. Instead of just erasing SNAKE they're doing it gradually. So, it'll fit in with the game."
50591,4,"Other reviews cover just about everything, but I'd like to add one important feature for us unfortunate few:

For whatever reason, I can't play Doom type 3D games without getting pretty darn seasick after 20 minutes or so.  I have had to give up on a number of games, such as Vampire Bloodlines, because going up and down stairs was just too much.  Anyway, I have a number of friends who suffer the same thing.

I tried both Need for Speed Undergound and Need for Speed Underground 2.  While the latter has a wonderful open feel of roaming around, it did make me seasick.  The first Need for Speed does not!  It's still wonderful visually.  I wish I could explore without racing, as in the sequel, but still the tradeoff is well worth it."
92113,4,"I first downloaded the demo from the playsation store and couldn't put it down. I finally picked up a copy and was impressed with what else wasn't featured in the demo.

You play as a mafia hitman double-crossed and looking for revenge. Your character has also been cursed with some sort of demonic possesion, adding some extras to the gameplay. The game itself is very dark and gothic. Reminds me of Underworld or Spawn meets Max Payne. Gameplay itself pans out like a John Woo movie.

The controls are very basic, and more ergonomic than other FPS on the PS3 to date. You will need to use your various demonic abilities to advance passed locked doors or clear a path, etc. But there was never a point it became too overwhelming or frustrating. The demons you can summon are much more of a novelty. Aside from the handfull of times they are needed to open a locked door or clear a path, you can use them as a forward scout to look around corners and attack opponents from behind or flank enemies you're engaging.

The multiplayer is surprisingly good. It's extremely fast paced like Quake. By far the best feature is being able to swap from human to demon form with one button. Humans carry the firepower, where the demons are extremely fast on their feet with only a melee attack to defend themselves. Online multiplayer comes with all the gameplay you'd expect in deathmatch, team deathmatch, CTF, etc.

One final thing worth mentioning about this game is the violence. You would assume any FPS would have it's share of gratuitus violence, but this game is very over the top. Game developers seemed to put extra attention to the blood and gore spilled out of an enemy after unloading so many rounds into him. There is also a type of execution move offered at anytime you sneak up behind an unexpecting AI in the story mode. It enables a small variety of random kills like putting the barrel of your gun into their mouth or just simply unloading both pistol clips into the opponent's chest. It's very overkill and extremely graphic.

Overall, the gameplay is a very solid 5. The offline game is very addicting, and the online multiplayer is a nice change from standard FPS. The only reason I gave the overall game a 4 is because the demo was a bit misleading. Not all the gameplay takes place in a New York underworld setting. I was very surprised when it takes a turn to a completely different time and place. I much prefered the gritty shooter the game started out as. The other half played is still visually stimulating and fun gameplay, just not what i expected or really interested in.

I highly recommend downloading the demo in the very least."
341138,4,good game
448070,4,"The idea on the game is very cool - command a planetary empire, and not as though it were a bunch of spreadsheets with a lousy GUI (ahem...Master of Orion 3).

The game has three major screens:
* Planetside - in which you build structures, manage power allocation, and fight in tank combat.
* Interstellar - in which you manage your vast fleets.
* Space combat - which can take place between ships or in orbit around one of your or your opponent's planets.

As much as it can be called ""realistic"" the space combat is just that. Attackers must overcome space fleets and planetary-based defenses before landing their attack ships on-planet.

The difficult part of this game is the economy - resources are gathered slowly, buildings are built slowly, and there is a maddening amount of time spent awaiting for these vital generators to do what you need them to do. Resource allocation is different than in the C&C series - it is quite frequent to run out of money, energy, or both, and you can do very little when either of these tickers hits zero.

In short, a fully entertaining and immersive game, just very very difficult."
437547,4,"The best thing about this game:  it is just like the original Carmegeddon, including un-PC levels of violence.  The worst thing about this game:  it is just like the original Carmegeddon.

I'm glad to have the chance to replay what is largely the same game as I played a decade ago, but at the same time I wish there were more graphics and gameplay improvements.  Can you imagine what it could have been if it let you design your car and weapons in much greater detail, or go on the road between arena levels, open-world style?  Still, it delivers what was promised and is a good trip back down memory lane."
344723,4,was having trouble with mic this fixed it
428040,4,"I am used to using very high quality and expensive mice (Logitech, Razer) and while this doesn't feel quite as stout and well-made as some more expensive gaming mice, it does the job. For the price, and for being a wireless mouse, this is a great buy. We purchased this more for the ""batman"" aesthetic than for actual gaming. A serious PC gamer should consider something else."
11889,4,Old school. Love this system.
24088,4,"For several years, I have played various versions of Pac-Man games.  What's included on this GBA package isn't all that bad, but I would have liked to see 2 additional installments -- Super Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man (the former is included on Namco Museum Megamix for the Wii).  However, what IS included is still good.

Pac-Man Original -- Who doesn't get sick of playing this??  All of the graphics and Pac-Man sounds are faithfully intact.  It's still as hard as ever making it to the 3rd cut mini-scene but once you do it's a riot!!

Pac-Attack -- At first it is difficult to understand how the gameplay works so it's probably best to start in Puzzle Mode.  It's great to have passwords included because some of the 100 puzzle levels are not easy.  But the music is rather repetitious and doesn't change at all.

Pac-Mania -- This version is okay but the soundtrack has been edited.  In order to hear the full versions, you would have to play the unlockable versions on Pac-Man World 2 or Namco Museum.  But the graphics on the small screen are still easy to see and the fun doesn't stop.

Pac-Man Arrangement -- THIS is the true gem of the collection.  Once you start you won't stop.  Everything about this version is spectacular.  If you make it to the final level you will have a boss robot to defeat.  Unfortunately, the only other console you would find this game on is the PSP.

So, overall, not bad, but as I stated, could have fit in the other 2 Pac-Man games."
303165,4,"Unfortunately my Xbox One doesn't work due to disc read rattling.  But I got to play this at my friends house.

+Physics are great (though I still prefer Gran Turismo or PC simulators)
+Car models are much improved
+Framerate is solid

-Environment detail and lighting are only minutely updated from Forza 4
-Less cars than Forza 4

Overall, this seems like a Forza 4.5 in 1080p.  It's pretty good for a launch title, but in some ways it's a step back from previous Forza titles.

I give it a 3.5/5 (rounded up for 4)"
68038,4,"the graphics and game play are amazing, but i had one problem with it, when i wanted to play with my girlfriend it turns out i couldnt, only one player unless theirs a system link or Xbox live, but a great game for any die hard Quake fan, and plus you get Quake 2 which i thought was a great bonus, wish they could have done that with other games"

172645,4,"Alpha protocol wasn't that fun at first, but it does get way better as you progress in the storyline and learn more skills. Just for those who aren't accustomed to RPG's, it is a good shooter if you level up the skills of the guns that you want to use.  At first you can't hit the broad side of a barn, but once you either find mods for your guns hidden in the levels, or purchuse through the black market (and level up your guns), it turns into an awesome shooter. Just be patient, and the further you progress in the game, new guns, mods, armors, and gadgets will be available on the market. There is actually quite a bit of weapons and mods to find and buy. This is not really a run and gun game, nor is it really a stealth game. It's more of a game where you have to approach each situation carefully. Stealth and firepower is an option, but neither will see you through the game alone. It's linear in that aspect, but the abilities and skills are very fun, and this is a really fun game in general. It's worth the price"
34646,4,"I had been looking for a great new MMO to play and i thought WOW was very good, but as good as i thought the game was i don't think i'll be playing it too much longer.  I just could not really get into this game for some reason, it was a bit too easy for my tastes and i'm probably going to be moving on from it but aside from that the game has wonderful graphics, great sound, tons of quests, cool classes and i think anyone who is even mildly interested in this game should give it a try."
90953,4,"I don't know if I can say much about this game.  The story was weird.  Kirby is about to eat cake, and it gets stolen.  So, Kirby goes through several worlds to get it back.  Eventually, it leads to a bigger plot involving the Squeak Squad and the treasure chests.  Anyway, the formula of the Kirby games is the same here.  My only problem is that it's too short, and because of that, it doesn't get the perfect score it deserves.  But this game is definitely still worth buying."
92148,4,BA is a fun game but definetly not your combat simulator. I did have a blast finishing the game and unlocking all the planes. I do believe however the second BA is better the this one.
186384,4,The game was really fun to play through as I played through the campaigns. The customizations for the character's weapons was a blast and I cannot wait to try the next Army of Two game.
40766,4,"This is one rental that actually turned into a purchase. I'm usually not a fan of hack and slash type games, but this one has turned out to be quite entertaining.
Like other games in this genre, Dark Alliance is a third person perspective game (kinda 2.5D) in which you venture through cellars, mines, dungeons and even outdoor environments like mountain and villages. Levels typically end with a ""boss"" of varying difficulty and combat style. Gameplay is mixed with first person cut scenes in which you converse with other characters in a multi-choice format.
Interestingly, you can only save your game at certain points.  At first this seems annoying, but there are enough save points around the game so it isn't too bad.  Another big plus is that saving is really quick.  If you've played games like Morrowind, where saving and loading are good opportunites to grab a drink, then you're in for a treat.  Unfortunately you can only save about 25 games at once and there is no way to describe the saved game.  A bit annoying, but oh well.
I'm not too much of a D&D fan, so I can't comment on how true this game is to the ruleset. However, as you move through the game you'll acquire better goods and have to manage your inventory and make decisions about how to develop your powers as you advance levels. Who knows if these mechanisms are authentic enough, but they are fun.. :)
Finally, one of the best aspects of the game (and why I ended up purchasing it) is the two player option. This put two players on the screen at the same time, working together to battle through the game. I find this style of multiplayer play to be much more enjoyable than split screen, and this is one of the few games that offers it."

It has a good story and fun to play."
324291,4,"Xcom Enemy within is simply an awesome game. If you like strategy games and Aliens then you should buy this game. It's basically the core game of Xcom Enemy Unknown along with all the DLC and a bunch of new features. You can now build mechs piloted by a surgically modified soldier, or use genetic modification of your soldiers. There's also a new human faction called EXALT which you have to fight and send in covert operatives to gain INTEL on to locate their HQ. Theirs a few new story missions and new game maps as well. The only downside was that this wasn't sold as a new DLC when it should have. You can't use any old XCOM saves and the previous game isn't needed even though it's the same core game from before. If you don't own the previous game then the price point was right on, but I firmly believe this should have been a $15-$20 DLC if you own XCOM Enemy Unknown."
93864,4,"Even though RPG's tend to be more ""nerd""-centered, I always find playing them more funner than fighters or sports games because they always centered around an engrossing story. Sure a lot of them are far from innovative or new, but they're all the more interesting anyway. The story, presentation and the characters in Odin Sphere are quite memorable and it's surprising how fast you get suckered into the world. But like a lot of games, it's the gameplay that gets it knocked down a tad and while it's not an ever-present flaw, it's still one of those things you have to suffer in order to get to the good stuff.

Story: You play a young girl who is reading books up in her attic. We then go inside the book's story and find ourselves in the world of Erion where the kingdom of Valentine fell victim to a creation of its own, the Crystallization Cauldron. Pretty soon, the Ringford fairies and the warriors of Ragnanival want it and are at odds. The game is separated into several books with their own chapters and acts and different characters.

Graphics: I'm not kidding when I say this is probably one of the most loveliest and beautiful looking 2D games I've ever seen. With detailed sprites, bright color palettes and background animation meant to breathe life into the environment, the game is quite something to see in motion. The only problem comes when there's too many activity on screen and the sprites are a little bigger than usual (some are literally the height or length of the screen) so the game has slowdown.

Sound/Music: Done by Hitoshi Sakamoto, the game is has some quite nice and memorable tunes which is kind of surprising because I wasn't too impressed with the Final Fantasy XII soundtrack. Also, a nice plus for those who love VA is an option for either English or Japanese. Even though the game in Japanese makes me think of a anime, I like keeping it in English which is good since, despite some occasional awkward readings, it's a solid job.

Gameplay: This is where the game takes a dip. Done in a 2D rotating map where each section on the level acts as a 2D outline but really you're just going in circles, it's kind of neat to find a 2D RPG after so many 3D ones. It's pretty once you get the hang of it and the controls will eventually feel more comfortable. However it's the other parts of your character that are a nuisance. For example, now and then you get special items you can equip which can either net you more EXP when you get Phozons (kind of like MP in a way where you can fill a meter to unleash a special attack), or more attack power, or better chance for items being dropped. But you can only do one at a time and they're not separate from your item list so these things can take up space and since enemies can easily stomp you silly, that's not a good thing. Be prepared to throw away/use a lot of items to make room for others.

Speaking of tough enemies, this game can easily hand you your *** if you're not careful. Sometimes they really pack a wallop or they can break your combos by somehow breaking through your attack and getting a lucky shot in. Then there's the bosses which can easily fill up a screen. To help in your fight you get special skills such as Phozon skills, items like Napalm. But some items hold special abilities such as different kinds of seeds where, when planted, will absorb surrounding Phozon which'll grow and bear health-giving fruit. Only sacrifice is that the Phozon charges your meter allowing for special attacks so it's kind of a trade off. Also another skill you pick up is Alchemy where you can combine items to create a better item or one with more potency.

A game like Odin Sphere is like a lot of games that near the system's life cycle where barely anyone knows about it, let alone played it yet there's a group of people who played it and loved it. Odin Sphere might not get massive amounts of fans but we're just glad we have a great RPG to play, even if people are playing games on the big boys."
139990,4,"I'd heard quite a bit about Spore, so I really looked forward to getting the Creature Creator when it came out.  Amazon delivered with typical speediness.  As for the CC, it's cool, don't get me wrong.  What you can make in just a few minutes is mind boggling. Like anything though once the novelty wears off, there's really not much here.  You'd be better off download the free CC, then waiting for the game to come out."
212643,4,"I absolutely love this game and series. It has excellent character and environmental graphics. You can customize characters on a greater level and choose from multiple styles. The only downfall the game has would be the lack of a story mode, which is surprising since the rest of the series had such strong and various story modes."
116404,4,"There's a definite Wuthering Heights feel to the opening here, and the main male character has a decided Heathcliff look to him. That makes it feel like this was designed with pre-teen and teen girls in mind; I don't know how big the young female gaming market is, but I would think that with the Celtic romantic adventure/mystery motifs this is a perfect fit. Then it all moves into the ""spirit realms"", where the Tolkienesque fantasy element comes into play, and very artistically.

The highlights for me are the very inventive and highly colorful creatures and landscapes, along with the excellent music. The sweeping symphonic sounds and atmospheric lushness to the soundtrack make Folklore come alive and lift it into another level of artistry.

The gameplay itself I found to be a little bit slow and too reliant on speech bubbles instead of voice-overs, but for parents wanting their kids to read more, this is a perfect game; they'll have to read a lot to get very far! There is a little too much walking with little purpose or action for my taste, and each new area is too small---there's a lot of little breaks for loading time that slow the whole adventure down. One nice feature, however, is the chance to play either the male or female character, with each having a different story line.

Not for those who crave lots of shooting or fighting, but a fine match for younger players with plenty of imagination and a taste for fantasy. Plus the quality of the art and music may make mom and dad want to play or watch along, never a bad thing (for some kids!). No pointless violence here, so all in all a very friendly game for most families, if not for those who demand non-stop action.
Nothing wrong with aesthetic beauty in place of bone-crunching violence, though, and the Folklore creators instilled this game with plenty of eye and ear candy."
379363,4,"If you love motocross you'll love this game. If you're not a motocross person it might not hold your interest for long. The graphics are good (could be better imo) and the playability is decent.

 I personally feel the addition of the ""reflex"" stick, where you have to now use both sticks to steer, has alienated people that aren't die hard mx fans from enjoying the game. It can be very hard to master and even harder if you've never ridden a motorcycle."
302580,4,"Love the system.

 I see a lot of 1 stars are from people saying games or features stopped working. The system sometimes gets hung up after auto updates, if your having issues were things do not open, you can turn system off and wait for it to stop flashing before restarting. Or hold the face button for 8+ seconds to force the system to dump everything close the modem and power down. This enables a forced reboot that should fix any issues that arrive from updates sometimes. Please do this first before selling your system! It is software related and almost always tied to a system update, not hardware. Google for now issues and fixes before you throw things away...  seriously!

 Only down side to system is lack of good games. there are a hand full of good games, and a lot of good ones coming end of year but usual to earliy adaptors your game pool is limited on a new consol."
125237,4,"This is a very fun game to play in cooperative mode, and the graphics are dark (HDMI) but very well done. Overall a great game for single, console multi-player, and live mult-player."
91924,4,Glad they brought this back.
227136,4,"does not come with wii remotes, but the batteries seem to hold their charge rather well and the charger,  charges the batteries,  when we are done playing at night we place the remotes,  come back the next after noon,  the remotes are fully charged."
25008,4,"I picked this up yesterday and after about 4 hours of play time I'd have to say:  So Far, So Good.  Yes, the camera is a little off at times. (stays behind a wall so you cant see what you're doing sometimes)  I guess there is still some slowdown as well, although I don't really notice it all that much.  One other issue is the re-spawning after a crash, sometimes it puts you in a weird spot and collision detection/clipping problems occur, but never for too long.
  Now on to the good:  I really enjoyed this game on the Dreamcast (first version) and this one has all the good points from it plus quite a few more.  The first thing you'll note is the size of the levels-HUGE!  You WILL get lost, but you'll have fun doing it.  Manuals/nose manuals have been improved, as have wallrides.  (lots 'o fun)  As one review put it nicely, the ""magnetic rails"" from the first version are much more realistic when you grind stuff too.  Graphics are pretty damned  impressive, especially the riders themselves.  The levels now include gaps, which is a welcome addition, and there's a new ""beginner"" control/config that mimics the mighty ""Hawk"" style, (hold down x to pedal/release to jump) which is much better/less confusing if you've spent as many hours as I have playing that mythic game.
  One disappointment to me though is that there still doensn't seem to be a real ""Abubaka"" (spelling?) or a ""Foofanoo"", 2 of my favorite tricks Dave & company do, especially out of a half pipe onto a back deck rail.  You can do a tailtap and try and land faky or try and bring it back around but it's just not quite there, especially if you have to cover some distance from the  rail back into the pipe.  Maybe I just need more practice?  (if anyone knows how to do these in this game please clue me in)
  I haven't played a complete version of Hoffman yet so I can't say for sure, but to me it seems like Hoffman is too identical to Hawk (more skate like) where as Mirra has more of the bike physics/feel.  The soundtrack is unusual to say the least but I like it.  Kudos to them for not having to use the newest/hippest stuff out there (re: ""Paranoid"" by Ozzy and ""She sells Sanctuary"" by the Cult)  I wish I could drop in some Queens of the Stone Age but with only 10 or so songs I always end up turning off the music anyway, gets old too quick.  I barely touched the level editor but it looks promising indeed.
  *So, to wind things up here...  Basically, if you like the first one you'll love this one and if you haven't tried it at all, give it a rent (1 or 2, on PS or DC-they all seem pretty good) and see if it's your cup of tea."
211399,4,"Lots of variety in animations but easy to skip some of it as it does get repetitive.
I love the 3D animated game.
It is fun to play and wow...if you sit down to play it you get hooked and I play until I either win or lose.
I am competitive by nature when I play a 'thinking' game.  This is like the board game...it takes lots of planning but lots of luck too.
I like the game and will come back to it for an hour of play."
197031,4,"The funny thing is, I got super pissed off when my favorite game review source (X-Play) gave this game a 4/5; and now you see me give this a four out of five, and it breaks my heart. But, once I beat the game, I realized that's what it was.

WHAT IT IS:
Skyward Sword is an origins story. A lot of it is very subjective, and opinion-based, like looking at a painting (which is what the game tried to ""look"" like). First thing to understand is that mankind (Hyrulians) does not live on the earth yet. They live in the sky (and the story explains why--and to some satisfying, if not cliche, extent). So, obviously, if only baddies live on the earth (with the exception of a few friendly creatures), then of course the exploring world/finding dungeon formula is going to change. The biggest difference is this: the entire world--except for Skyloft and the little islands around it--is a massive dungeon.

CHANGES:
Nintendo cut out a lot of the fan favorites because they simply did not make sense in the game (or maybe they were too lazy to make them make sense). For instance, there's no Epona--which is a bummer, and there's no riding any creature except for a bird. Maybe that's a spoiler, but it's a spoiler best known before buying the game. This is just a small gripe, but it takes away the sense of ""freedom"" that Ocarina, Majora's Mask and Wind Waker had (yes, I'm deliberately leaving out Twilight Princess--I'll get to that in a moment). There's no Skull Kid; no wacky, optional side-quests (like making the Big Goron Sword or finding all the sweet masks in Majora's Mask); there's no magic meter, instead it's replaced by a stamina meter which allows link to do some acrobatics--a blend between assassins creed controls and the stamina in Skyrim. It is not bad, but I do miss the magic meter.

The bosses in this game, kind of like the parasite boss in Twilight Princess, feel organic and, at times, unexpected. It's because the whole world is a dungeon, so it's kind of hard to know when you'll face a boss. Well, I say that rather loosely, because once you get into the rhythm of the game, you'll know. But the bosses themselves, I have to say, are a mixed bag. Some of them are sweet, and one or two just don't fit in with the Zelda mythology at all--and that's awkward. And mini-bosses for the most part are just not really there.

The best change, which is different in Twilight Princess, is the interactions between characters. You don't just talk to them and have it not mean anything. There's actually things you can do to make them like you better. That's why I didn't like Twilight Princess as much . . . character interactions (and interesting characters) were non-existent; though, in Skyward Sword, they're vibrant and refreshing. Although, there just isn't enough to carry the game.

GAMEPLAY:
The controls, surprisingly, are the strongest aspect of the game (aside from flying and swiming, which WILL be a hassle). Most enemies require a certain strategy to kill them. Sometimes it's confusing understanding how to kill an enemy, but . . . that's where Fi comes in hand. You can save about $15 by not getting a Guide Book if you just listen to her (the artifical intelligence that helps you and resides in your sword). Basically if you are stuck, talk to her, and she usually gives the hint on a golden platter. She's a little more helpful than Navi. And she's more helpful (and less annoying) than Midna; although, you might be put off by Fi's . . . uh . . . dull personality, but don't blame her: she's an AI.

On the flipside, let's talk about HOW the game is played. I'd like to say that it's an RPG where you can do what you want when you want (and in ways you can) but you ultimately can't. It's straight forward. You can sidetrack a bit, but for what reason? Literally none. Except for some money, some heart pieces, some things to sell and use to forge weapons (like in Skyrim, but not as cool). It's an element that I find cool, but realized halfway through the game that I did not even need to reinforce any weapons. But, unlike in Twilight Princess, you actually need to buy things once in a while. That's very smart. It's something that Nintendo actually listened to fans about, because if you have ruppees, shouldn't there be stuff to use 'em for? Bravo Skyward Sword. But, like I said, the game is never so challenging that you MUST do forging/reinforcing. It's not like in Resident Evil 4 where it helps a lot and is fun to see the updated version of the items.

PACING/STORY ELEMENTS:
But, here's the thing. Yes it's practically an on-rails game (maybe even more than Twilight Princess), but the pacing is magnificent and the story is a redeeming quality. I'm one of the Zelda fan's that did not like TP; I thought it was stale, and they changed too many things about the franchise. I didn't like becoming a wolf; it wasn't fun: it was a task. I didn't like the stupid Zora quest, or, matter of a fact, any of the quests in TP--except when I learned Ganondorf was behind everything. But, even though the origin story is good in some parts, it's frustrating in others. Particularly the Ganondorf origins: there's one of two origins they hint at. One being with the final boss, Demise; the other possible origin hinted **(and I don't think this is a spoiler, it's speculation--but it was implied several times)** being that Groose (Link's childhood bully, and a guy who's in love with Zelda but can't have her) actually becomes Ganondorf over time, or at least he's an ancestor: you may have a different opinion. But, it's just too subjective. Yeah, I like the fact that it's like a surreal painting and you have to choose for yourself, but at the same time, I'd like to know for certainty. I won't say too much more for the sake of spoilers.

I really did like the concept that no human's lived on the earth. It sort of took the Adam and Eve story in a sense, mixed in with Zelda mythology.

BUT:
Where Twilight Princess was trying to be MORE than a Zelda game, Skyward Sword is JUST trying to be a Nintendo game. In fact, it is similar to Super Mario Galaxy. You'll see what I mean. A lot of the characters were too Nintendo-esque , and didn't fit in with Zelda-mythology. Such as the three dragons and then the inhabitants of the desert area (I won't say what they are, because that's a spoiler--and no they're not pikmin, I wish they were). It's a very mixed bag of characters. Some are interesting, some just don't fit.

And then there's the copy and paste enemies over and over and over (not enough variety)--it gets old when you draw near the end of the game.

I compare this game to Resident Evil 5. It has SOME redeeming qualities, but not enough to make it a perfect game. And similar to RE5, they both have changed a successful formula which resulted in mixed reactions. I don't care so much about the formula of the series, per se, but Skyward Sword just wasn't a Zelda game--it was, however, an excellent ""Nintendo"" game. And in some ways its better than Twilight Princess.

But, it is like an abstract painting. Each person will see something different. I see potential and the failure to exceed it; I see innovative controls with some flaws; I see a condensed world with very little to offer by ones own wandering; the lands are lonely, kind of like Riven or Mist, but not effectively lonely. For me, there are SOME things I can't get past. And I can't describe them because they're spoilers.

CONCLUSION:
You might think what's so wrong with a 4/5 . . . and the answer is, for a Zelda game, a 4/5 is not good. A 5/5 is not good. 6/5 is more like it. And Skyward is not a 6/5. Nintendo has been in some sort of creative slump in the Zelda franchise following Wind Waker. I recommend this game for a Wii user, because this and Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bro's Brawl is really all Nintendo has. But, is Skwyard Sword a reason to buy the system (like Twilight Princess was)? No. Not quite. It's good. But not quite good enough. And I think it lacked a little bit of horror, a little bit of magic, a little bit of WEIRD--and settled for colorful, fun and NINTENO-ESQUE."

349948,4,"The rgb lighting isn't my thing (it was cheaper than 2015 edition with prime) but the mouse itself is gorgeous. -1 star on behalf of claw-grip users, but lets be honest; razer offers several different mice and if you need a different mouse that works you don't need to look far.

Side note: I destroy cables because I tend to be careless. This has a beautiful braided cable and I'm not sure if I could break it if I tried."
370675,4,"all of the buttons are in perfect locations for me, i don't accidently hit ANY(which im often prone too on mice) just enough of them for my keybinding style
im more of a hybrid between palm and claw grip, from a personal standpoint the mouse feels good in the hand. it does feel sometimes that my thumb and pinky are too close in that squeeze position, but not enough to bother me much. i have just a little larger than avg male hands.
it has a very smooth glide and whips across my cloth mouse pad. the feet seem sturdy enough to last a while, the specs say they do.
all of the clicks on the mouse are nice. only the dpi down switch is a little bendy'ish feeling. the mouse clicks feels a little dampened though, the click isn't as crisp as the other buttons.
only the scroll wheel feels a little cheap. hard click and scrolling and i really don't like the it.
THE SNIPER BUTTON IS ACTUALLY USEFUL LOL. i thought id rebind it instantly, but im using it quite a bit for lots of medium/long range weps.
the cord is stiff like others say.. it does happen to sometimes get in the way. even with it anchored properly, its like wearing over-starched dickies with speedo's."
183512,4,"To preface - I loved Battlefield 1 when I first got my PS3. It was the first game I really got stuck into. BF2 while an awesome sequel has one major let down to my mind and that's the size of the maps.

In BF1 you could approach a target from a few angles most of the time and head off road to circle round, but in BF2 those huge environments seemed to be framed around the mission. There is a road and you have to follow it. While I appreciate the attention to detail, BF2 seems smaller to my mind and the opportunities to really explore have been limited by the huge attention to details rather than the whole.

Other than that, this is a wonderful game with some really great content."
308130,4,Both thrilling and frustrating but worth the money. Playing both Smokey and the Bandit is a nice change of pace.
51074,4,"I was always a computer devotee when it came to gaming, I never got into the whole console debacle, until now.

I got a PS2 for a birthday present a couple of months ago, and I'm so glad I did. There's some games I've wanted to play that are only available on PS2 (Broken Sword 3 for instance). So I was happy with my present. And what do I think of it?

The PS2 is brilliant, but it has it's flaws.

For an example, when I got it, my Dad and I bought one and brought it home to set it up. We turned it on and 5 minutes later, it turned itself off and wouldn't turn back on. We'd only bought it 20 minutes earlier and it was already broken. We took it back and they gave us a new one. This one worked perfectly, so I was satisfied. But it's pretty shoddy work to have it break 5 minutes after turning it on for the first time.

And I the only person who has dust galore all over it after letting the console sit for a couple of days? I have nowhere to put it, so I have to put it on the floor - I leave it there for two days and come to use it and it's coated in dust.

I also don't like how you have to buy memory cards for it - the memory card is expensive on it's own, not including the PS2 itself AND games.

But the good things are it's a nifty little piece of technology - very sturdy and small. It doesn't take up that much room and it plugs into any TV. I have a small TV in my room and it plugs and works on it fine, which makes me happy. The controls aren't that hard to use, it really depends on what game you buy, but it didn't take me long to figure out how to work the controller. The graphics are pretty amazing too, especially since it's being played on a TV versus a computer. And I LOVE the fact you can play DVDS on it - I have a DVD player, but it's always being used by somebody else. And I can't play normal movies on my computer, so the PS2 is perfect. Fabulous.

So the PS2 is an amazing piece of technology, but it definitely has it's flaws. I'm still pretty annoyed the first one we bought broke immediately."
300451,4,"Very fun - a lot like the previous Mario Golf games. One critique, which prevents the 5 stars. The campaign/ single player mode is geared towards using your Mii. I would have like to see it be more about unlocking and using different characters, such as the Mario Gold Toadstool Tour for the GameCube. Still, a strong game for the 3DS"
161365,4,"This game is absolutely fun to play.  One must compare this game to its competition and that is GTA IV.  GTA IV has the better story, is more serious, and has the better graphics.  Saints Row 2 is more fune to play and has much better online game play.  Saints Row 2 offers full co-op which allows your friends to jump into one of your games and leave just as easily (or vise versa) and has specific online modes.  In-vehicle controls are also better for Saints Row 2 as one can easily fire out of a moving vehicle without having to hold two buttons like (like GTA IV).  Saints Row 2 has many screen tearing issues and the graphics can come off as a little cartoonish when compared to GTA IV.  The PS3 version also had muddier graphics (ie darker, less clear) than the Xbox 360 release.  I actually think that this is a plus as it takes away from the cartoonish feel making things grittier.  Is the game a perfect 10/10 (or 5/5 in this case)?  No.  Wat GTA IV perfect? Absolutely not.

I think that Saints Row 2 is the perfect compliment to GTA IV as it allows you to explore the competition.  Get both games and you won't be disappointed."
173282,4,This is a great classic game I picked up waiting for the release of Guild Wars 2. While the game is old it still has a lot to do and is fun to play. The class combining is a different take on the typical style that adds a lot to character development.
340161,4,"So far so good! i've bought the headset on august 15 and since then it worked amazing for the money! The microphone sounds really clear and the headphones are really really clear and comfortable, i would recommend this to anyone looking for a good headset.

Update: The right ear is beginning to cut out, hopefully the warranty covers it, For now i am down-rating from 5 stars to 4 stars."
140266,4,"Not very satisfied with the survival edition, it did come with a great game and a poorly built PIPBoy clock. The clock is not that good. I purchased a couple editions for gifts and they all keep going dead overnight. They all last about 1 day and need new batteries again - forget that!! Seems to be a problem with the clocks draining the batteries down over night. I suggest just buying the cheaper edition.
- The game is great.  You definitly need a guide book. The problem is that it does end and you would have to start over again. Not as good as Oblivion. Oblivion is much more colorful and happier."
463885,4,"I don't care much for racing games, but World Rally is actually fun to play. Children and adults can have playing it."
12485,4,"Really fun, but kinda old.  Plus, Starcraft is way better."
408281,4,"To put this review in the proper light, I must begin by saying that, minus vacations, I have been playing Destiny nearly every day since it was first released. In spite of it's flaws, and there were/are many, I am a huge fan of this game. This game seems to be designed to stimulate the same receptors that are excited by gambling. You play and things drop like coins from a slot machine with all of the fanfare and sound effects of an Atlantic city casino. You experience this ""gambling high"" while you run around as a heavily armed and heavily armored Titan, Warlock or Hunter, shooting alien monsters in the face. Its like playing a slot machine in the middle of a space war.

This gambling mechanic, where the best loot in the game, drops randomly, rather than by skill or effort, is one of the major flaws of Destiny. It is the basis for many peoples love or hatred of this game and it is the main contributor to the grind involved in playing Destiny.

With the Taken King, Destiny has completely re-imagined the games economy to remove some the grind, reward play in PVE AND crucible, while continuing to offer random rewards. Things that were once just lucky drops, can now be earned more predictably with added features like Three of Coins and Vanguard Streak. The result is a greatly improved gaming experience that retains much of what made Destiny good while fixing many of the problems that probably launched thousands of controllers at TVs.

Notable Fixes and Additions:

1. Just playing the game gains you relevant drops and experience.
2. Blue and Green drops have new significance.
3. Quests add depth to the new story content.
4. Many worthwhile guns and armor pieces can be earned following a quest path.
5. The Dreadnaught area is large and more dangerous than previous areas.
6. Old strikes and stories have been reworked.
7. New crucible modes like Rift and Zone Control add to the PVP variety.
8. All weapons have been re-leveled with a cap going to 300 (possibly beyond).
9. A dismantled (sharded), year 2 exotic weapon can be repurchased at the tower.
10. Previously owned year 1 exotic armor and weapons can be purchased for Legendary marks.
11. The gunsmith has reputation AND quests.
12. Exotic and Legendary weapons can be infused to a higher level using legendary marks, glimmer and dismantling a weapon of higher power.
13. Ghosts now offer perks like increased intellect, material locating and increased glimmer from a specific enemy race, like the Hive.
14. Arm bands, sashes and cloaks also have perks like increasing the rate of scout rifle experience.
15. Two words: Nolan North. Much better than Dinklebot.
16. Two more words: Nathan Fillion. He adds some desperately needed humor to this series.

Some cons:

1. All of your year 1 gear will be nearly irrelevant upon completion of the story mission on your way to level 40. I say nearly, because the gunsmith asks you to shard rare and higher weapons during certain quests and year one weapons count.
2. The Gjallahorn rocket launcher you finally bought at the end of year one will be useful for about 2-3 hours of game play. See #1.
3. Iron banner sashes, arm bands and cloaks have lost nearly all value. I think they are level 30 vs. the cap of Level 300.
4. You still need to put in the hours to get the best gear.
5. The new story can be completed in about 4-5 hours, which is short for a new game. (Although the quests add a lot more gameplay meat.)
6. UPDATE: Without the availability of Etheric Light to upgrade year 2 weapons and armor, the Iron Banner has lost some of its purpose.
7. UPDATE: After 50+ matches in Iron Banner, I received 1 Iron Banner specific drop, the titan sash. This is counter to what Bungie described as the primary way of earning Iron Banner gear: Drops.
Gamers are passionate about this game. The low ratings of this game give some insight into that. Many of the people giving this game a low rating have played and been burnt out by the grind of the year one version of this game. These are experienced players that have put hundreds of hours into a game and come away disappointed. The expectations were so high for year 2 to fix every problem that backlash is probably inevitable.
8. UPDATE to #7: The latest patch has fixed the drop rate for the Iron Banner significantly. My drops for the week have been, 310, 311 and 313 Ghost Shell, 298, 299 and 300 Chest Piece, 308, 304 and 303 gauntlets, 318 greaves, 284 and 289 Machine Gun, and a 283 and 287 Hand Cannon.

The Taken King has not fixed every problem in Destiny. In addition, it has locked Year One players who don't buy the expansion out of some critical content. The game can still be a grind. In spite of all that, this is the best version of Destiny to date. It is an ambitious, deep and addictive game. The story telling has improved and the core gameplay continues to be enjoyable.

Try this game."
4324,4,"If you need team-based with a blend of Unreal Tourney and the Sci-Fi Channel, here's a good title to work on. It's all multiplayer, so there's no single-player mode (besides the training missions). It's a hard game to explain, but I can say this: this game is fun and heck and lets you take any role, whether it be a repairman, heavy defence, or transport pilot. Buy this if your computer isn't so hot. If you do have a good computer with a GeForce2, get Tribes 2; it adds on to the first in almost every way and is a little more fun than this title. But get either one, Tribes is one of Sierra's best titles."
144132,4,"I only purchased this game recently (Dec. 2012) as I needed some titles that did not require internet access. Most of the newer FPS games focus mostly on multiplayer, which is a continuing trend in the industry. This has benefits, such as the incredible multiplayer experience of Battlefield 3, one of the best video games that I have ever played. It also has some downsides, as the single player experience becomes relatively degraded.

My previous experience with this game was a demo version I downloaded years ago. At the time I could tell there was something unique about this game, but by the time I was ready to purchase it, Bad Company 2 was already out, so I bought that instead.

The single player in this game seems better than any other FPS I have played. Every level is outdoors, and the maps are so expansive. You don't get the feeling that you need to follow a predetermined ""track,"" and there is a lot of flexibility on how you can approach objectives.

The gameplay is almost unparalleled, with a variety of different vehicles, equipment and weapons at your disposal. There is even a mission where you pilot a helicopter, which could be the basis for an entire separate game. You can really appreciate the time and attention to detail the developers put into this.  The environment is almost completely destructible, much more so than in BC2 and BF3.

I think the free demo is still available on xbox live, so if you are considering this game you should download that first. You can also find good used deals on Amazon with this title, as it came out in 2008."

41885,4,"I'll skip the history lesson and get straight to the point.

If you're looking for more Legend of Zelda, this is it.  Don't be turned off by the cel-shaded visuals.  In fact, I think they add a little extra personality to the game.  However, if you're still annoyed, just wait for the next one, of which there are already some screenshots of showing off a more realistic visual style.

Anyway, like I said, the cel-shading adds some extra personality to the game.  There are several emotions that can be shown on the characters (Link included), and in fact suit the more story oriented direction of the game.  Oh, there's still a lot of gameplay, but from start to finish they added some extra stuff that will appeal to Zelda fans.  In fact, I can't think of a single Zelda fan that wouldn't like the final showdown between Link and Ganon (yep... he's back).  The environmental visuals are also worth mentioning.  The world is so much more vibrant than Ocarina of Time (the Zelda game on the N64).  That says a lot, considering how incredible Ocarina of Time looked back then in the environmental effects department.

Sound wise, this is standard Zelda fare.  However, it's worth mentioning that this game does well in the technical department here.  One great touch is how they add a little extra strength to the battles by using sound and music.  Not only that, tensity in general is aided by just minor touches added in the audio department.

Now the gameplay.  One of the best things in this game is the fights.  The targeting system from Ocarina of Time is back, but along with it they've slightly spruced up how battles work.  First off, the different ways to take out an enemy has increased a little bit.  You can pick up enemy weapons from defeated foes, though only keep them for that area.  While not entirely significant, it's a nice touch that makes the fights more dynamic and fun.  Secondly, the enemies block better... or at least the ones that are capable of it.  Going up against some of the armored baddies and moblins is quite fun.  A full room of them is just an absolute blast (as well as challenging), and there are a few places in the games that are packed with these enemies.  Also, the game has added a new option called ""parry.""  It's actually better than it sounds.  Basically, if certain enemies get into a certain attack position, there's an audio and visual cue that says you can perform a parry attack.  If you press it soon enough, not only will you dodge their attack, but then Link will do a cool attack on the enemy that's usually does quite a bit of damage, or breaks an enemy's defense.

There is one big flaw that would likely keep me from playing this again.  The ocean.  The world of Wind Waker is separated into little islands.  To get to these, you have to sail on a boat (a talking boat that actually gives you hints throughout the game) and go from one island to the next.  This can be a problem, because there's quite a bit of traveling to be done, and there's also quite a bit of time consumed in travel.  On top of that, one part of the game actually requires you to go on sort of a ""scavenger hunt"" to find some items necessary for completing the game.  This is the only reason I give the game 4 stars instead of 5 (it's pretty prevalent, too, and non-avoidable).

At the very least, anyone who has a Gamecube should play through this game once.  If you can get past the traveling element, you will find a beautiful, rich, and engaging world in Wind Waker.  If you can't, then at the very least rent it.  The world of this game is more fully realized than ever."
112851,4,"I was a latecomer to the Guitar Hero series.  I have never been a huge fan of rhythm games; while they are fun initially, they rarely hold my interest in the long run.  Guitar Hero, however, was a different beast altogether.  The series is been predicated on simple yet challenging gameplay, made addictive when combined with the inherently fun aspect of being a rock legend playing well-known tunes.  I loved Guitar Hero II, and I picked up III the day it came out.  I decided to save some money and pick up the game-only version, as all previous peripherals work with this third version.

The GOOD: This game is graphically impressive, though most of your time is spent looking at a fretboard and not the background animations.  The gameplay is as addictive as ever, and the new boss battles are a nice, though ultimately shallow, wrinkle to the game.  They can range from this super-easy to the uber-hard, especially on the higher difficulty levels.  The set list is okay, though it's nice to have some truly classic bands in a Guitar Hero game: Metallica, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Rolling Stones, Guns 'n Roses (was also in GH II).

The BAD: I feel this franchise has been taken as far as it can be taken, in terms of gameplay.  You can always add more songs and I'm sure it'll sell copies, but unless something dramatic changes with the mechanics, I don't know how you could genuinely market the next Guitar Hero as a ""new"" game.  Playing this game was almost exactly like playing GH II, which is definitely not a bad thing, but it meant I got through it and bored of it quicker.  I also wish that a guitar hero game were made with a truly great song list.  As with most albums, there are a lot of ""filler"" songs  in this game, songs that either nobody's heard of, or that well-known but not exactly guitar rock anthems (Hit Me With Your Best Shot?  Come on...).  I know a lot of it has to do with licensing from the artists' end, but where are Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Dire Straits, Eric Clapton (though Cream is on there), Buddy Guy, Yngwie Malmsteen... the list goes on.

Bottom Line: Great fun, and very addicting for a while.  I'd give the song list a B/B+ at best."
344752,4,"Hands down this remote is the best way to operate apps on the Xbox. There's a backlight feature that is motion activated so the moment you pick up the remote the buttons glow.
Controls the Xbox without a Kinect which is fine for my set up since i use an external sound block that has its own remote.
Apps used: Plex, YouTube, ABC, Amazon video.
Works great! No longer have to fumble with a controller. Console feels more like a streaming box now."

123316,4,"As a long time Karter since the SNES days, I am excited to finally MK come to the Wii. The Wii Wheel should be your only option; it makes the game much more fun. The tracks and characters are extensive. You will have plenty of hours of play, especially with the online component.

My HUGE complaint, as a ""veteran"" racer, is the rubber band AI. Watch out if you're in the top 5 anytime during a race. You can be hit by shells, struck by lightning and spun out in a span of less than 10 seconds, dropping you to 12th. Meanwhile all you get are banana peels for being in the front. Trust me, you'll want to toss the wheel. The items should be random for everyone and the game should be geared for everyone, not just beginners. The same thing occurs online.

The best way to enjoy is to play with buddies, either via friend codes or locally. By three wii wheels and get to racing!"
172980,4,Good game.
208480,4,More of the same but it's what we want. Three large awesome environments. Looks great on ps3.
469907,4,"ive been playing this game on/off for years when ever i have a itch to buy it.. though i keep getting stuck in the same exact place even with help from youtube lol, its alot of fun the fighting style is real basic and easily controlled, the character can seem a lil clunky sluggish when reacting, but his power makes up for it with some very cool decapitations/executions.... this game being pretty old doenst require alot of b.s dlcs to make it fun, which is a big plus!!! the blood comparison is nowhere near something of say mortal kombat 9 or dead space, its on the tamed side, you don't really learn alot of norse viking actual information i.e history.. but overall id give it a 4 for the amount of good content which doesnt take countless hours to beat 'again even though i haven't beaten it lol', you save clans men or say tribesmen who come to your aid thruought, its not worth buying new but its worth a definite play through"
107828,4,"This is a different game from the ordinary, but there just isn't enough to seperate it from the crowd of games. The game is funner than in it is good though. The game is really easy to pick up and isn't all that hard to play. The leaderboards are neat and so is the scoring system. The only big strike to the game is that you can beat it in under 3 hours, maybe even 2 hours. The game is fun and is worth picking up for about 20 dollars, but much more than that is a bad deal. All in all if you like competitive scoring based games, in which I do, than you will like this new spin on third person action.

Overall 7.5-8.0"

452380,4,"Frogger is one of my favorite characters that really has not been seen much in video games for a while. I have played games that were not as good as this one. It had moments of intence excitment but some levels felt that they were unbeatable and took a long time. Still, this early 3D game is okay to buy for those who like those old challenging games."
454866,4,"As a fan of both Koei and the strategy simulation games, I knew Romance 7 was going to be enjoyable.  And I wasn't wrong.  I've been playing this series ever since it was on the original Nintendo in the late 80's, and it's gotten progressively better since then.
With Romance 7, you're still in China around 200 AD, struggling to gain control while the famous warlords vie for power.  The Wu, Wei, and Shu clans are at each other's throats, and it will be up to you to determine where your allegiance lies.
You can use the characters from the Three Kingdoms storyline, such as Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Sun Jian, but you are also able to create custom characters to use as yourself and your subordinates.  The gameplay for building your empire and acquiring new talents is very involved and fulfilling.
The combat is not as good as I had expected.  Fortunately, it is turn-based, but there's very little you get to see graphically.
Other than that, though, it's just what I'd expect from Koei.  Rent it if you're not sure if you like the strategy series, but if you've played any of the other versions, I recommend just purchasing it."
418900,4,"The reviews about the echoey surround sound are true. However, I got used to it that way. The default EQ settings are horrible for footsteps so I had to change my EQ settings to be able to hear footsteps better. I used the beatmode EQ settings on the astro gaming forums (google it if you want it). The echoey surround sound is very much true for this Mixamp. I still have my 2013 Mixamp and I used to prefer that Mixamp to the TR Mixamp. However, the TR Mixamp is actually slightly better for footsteps when you have the right EQ settings. You should eventually get used to hearing the echo in the surround sound. I like the convience of not needing a chat cable, because my old chat cables kept breaking with my old 2013 A40 + Mixamp Pro. So the new TR Mixamp is great in that it doesn't need a chat cable (voice goes over USB and sounds much clearer than the old Mixamps). All in all, the old Mixamps sounded better because there was no echo, so I'd only ""upgrade"" to this one if you need to. This is still a good mixamp and I recommend it ONLY IF you can get used to the surround sound echo, which might be too bothersome for many people. The first thing I wanted to do was return this, but now I like it."

186869,4,"I bought this game because it's predecessor was so utterly fantastic,but although I find it enjoying it doesn't come close to the original,it's more linear,has much less exploration,less customisation it has a far more basic leveling system which I hate,also I hate the thermal clips,it has a weaker story-line and the music isn't as good,but if you're more into shooting than doing the usual running around exploring and customising then you will enjoy it more,for me though it's inferior,although vastly better than number 3."
273554,4,"I have enjoyed this installment of the COD series a lot. Though short, I thought it had one of the most fun solo playthroughs in ages. Great visuals and voice acting, decent and complex story, and because it jumps around in time, lots of different fun weapons to try.
I wish the online experience was as varied.
I was hopeful that this would be a little different for me. I am middle aged, but like the FPS's and have had some excellent times in multiplayer settings. But for the most part I can't keep up with the hair-trigger kids out there. Additionally, there is a pretty high titer of jerks online, ranging from racist ranters to intolerant neck beard people. I just want to have a good time and there were possibilities that Black Ops 2 might have offered with skill matching and training levels. Oddly, and I don't understand why someone who prestiged twice in the first week feels the need to be in the Boot Camp or my League Play level. The matching system seems irrelevant.

I would love to see COD either hone the skill matching system/ranking or eventually change around the gameplay enough (it's exactly the same layout as before) so that newbies and people who just suck at it can still enjoy the experience without getting yelled at or frustrating the better players. This is not a game where you get to be an apprentice."
289438,4,"First of all, I'm a hardcore PC gamer. I tend to beat the crap out of my mice and use them the most a person can. I've gone through many mice before this to include a variety of Razer mice, the R.A.T 7 and a few other Logitech mice. So this review will be based off of my past experience with those mice as well as what I want out of a mouse.

____________
Design:5/5
This mouse feels great to use. I like the ergonomic design as well as the hydrophobic texture. It fits in my hand very well, and feels good when using it with both palm grip and claw. However, I would like to see it widened slightly around where the thumb rests, it's a bit too skinny and makes it difficult at points when in the heat of ""battle"".

The texture is very nice. I really like how it's not sticky, but not smooth. It has enough grip to where you don't have to worry about how you hold it, and it will last for hours of gaming when your hands are sweaty.
____________
Parts:3/5
The included parts of the mouse are very high quality. The primary mouse buttons are durable and offer a very satisfying ""click"" when enough pressure is applied. I wish they would have used the same Omron switches for the middle mouse click as they did with the main two buttons, because it's very stiff and hard to push down. And yes, I do use this a lot. Also, the macro buttons as well as the ones on the side are all a bit mushy and unsatisfying to use.

I enjoy the All-in-one esque USB receiver that Logitech has been using. Living in the dorms I tend to get a lot of wireless interference, though I haven't even gotten the slightest glitch when using this mouse. It's very reliable and I never have to worry about it.

The included charging cable. This is my biggest annoyance with this mouse. It's a very stong cable, and the micro-usb side of it is designed for a care-free plug in where you never have that ""WTF why won't this go in"" moment when plugging in the mouse. BUT, and that's an extremely large but, it's too thick. It's irritating to use while plugged in. It's a completely different mouse, and in a bad way.
____________
TL;DR
Very good mouse for the price. Great feel, good ergonomics for both palm and claw styled users. Downsides are mushy macro keys, stiff middle button, and horribly thick cable for charging. Even with those deficits, I still rate this a 4/5"
25822,4,"NHL 2002 for the Sony Playstation 2 is a decent hockey game with some good points, bad points, and a few completly terrible points.
The good: It's hockey (I seem to say that every year, but hockey is a great sport). This game has great graphics and options (dynasty/franchise mode for example). AI is much improved in the goalies from last season. Goalies are much more consistant this year as scoring is a bit more difficult and realistic on the medium and difficult modes. Also, the game plays true-to-life when it comes to your strategy. If you go all-out to constantly make open-ice hits or don't dump the puck into the offensive zone while changing lines, there's a great chance you'll give up odd-man rushes that can very well lead to a lot of goals against.
The bad: The sound has hurt this game more than anything. The play-by-play and color comentating are the worst I've ever heard. This is hockey--a full contact game where the weak get crushed and pounded and fighting gets you five minutes rather than five games. The developers at EA have decided to take a physical sport and turn it into some kind of comical relief type of atmosphere that doesn't work at all. Checks sound like explosions and slap shots sound like rockets. EA needs to hire a new sound team as each season their sound effects keep getting worse. The music even has the comical Bare Naked Ladies group for their music choice. And where's the organ music (seldom heard) and national anthems? Also, some added replay features are put into the game to stop the action while some stupid replay of a big save or big hit is shown three times (this can be turned off, though--which makes this a waste of programming and dics space). Breakaways are put into widescreen mode to ""add"" to the excitement or whatever of one of the most exciting moments of the game. Well, it does take getting used to, but this feature is not wanted in a hockey sim.
The ugly: Fighting looks much better this year, but it's still a non-skilled, button-mashing contest. No ducking or grabbing--just fistacuffs thrown for about three seconds. The fighting in EA's NHL 96 for the Sega Genesis was much better than this garbage (remember pulling your opponents jersey over their head, throwing them down to the ice, and continue to beat him while they're down?--Ahhh, the good days of real hockey programming--Mark Lesser: Where are you?!?). I'd love to see that go from 16-bit to what we have today on the PSX2--not this button-mashing garbage.
This is not a bad title by any means. When you get used to the controls and aweful color comentary, you'll see that this is an addictive game as there is a lot of simutation and realism involved. Simply adjust the options to your liking and to eliminate to annoying garbage and you'll have a great sim on your PSX2. Is it better that NHL 2001? In most areas, yes. It's not the add-ons that make it better (with the exception of the franchise mode), it's the better gameplay (mainly the goalie AI) that makes it better."
137219,4,"Finally, I got a copy of Fallout 3 COLLECTOR'S EDITION. Whoa! Collector's edition! The game comes in a nifty little lunchbox with Vault-Boy all over it. When you open it you see the actual game, then under that is a making-or DVD sloppy put into a cardboard thing. After that there is a book full of color concept art, like weapons, enemies, and stuff like that. Then there is a sweet little bobblehead...that was broken. Yeah. The stupid thing is so poorly packaged, the bobblehead breaks. The dude broke off the stand. Then the lunchbox fell apart, literally. Luckily, I was able to exchange the game for a new one, and it wasn't broken. The game itself is awesome! You got guns and zombies and mutants and stuff like that. Best of all, you can mod it. The requirements aren't that bad, just a reasonable processor and graphics card. The graphics in the game are pretty good on ultra high setting. For people like me who couldn't get this because of the gore, you can disable it very easily. You can connect to LIVE on this game as well get achievements and send messages and stuff. Great game, Great stuff, and well worth $60."
338256,4,A good Lego game.
465900,4,"I never would've believed it after reading all the reviews mentioning how difficult Solomon's Key is, but I think Solomon's Key is a masterpiece.  A frustrating, yet satisfying masterpiece.  A game that *truly* makes you feel good when you finally complete a tough level.

The idea is simple, but the execution INSANELY hard.  Upon arriving to a room, look for the key (usually out in the open for you to see right away).  You have to make platform blocks with your wand to reach the key and then walk through the exit door (the exit door could be anywhere in the room, which is another challenge just to get to).  You can usually see the key and exit door out in the open right away.  However the game isn't *that* easy.  No way man!  If simply making blocks/building platforms to the key and the exit door was that simple, I'd have put the game down right away.  Such a simple concept would make it a children's game almost.

Nope!  These rooms are loaded with all kinds of enemies.  Dragons, fireball spitting gargoyles, floating ghosts, electrical sparks, dwarfs, rotating demon heads, orange rats, spinning skeleton heads, pigs, blue fire, red fire (the difference between the two fires is clever), marching wizards, flying red mice and more.  These enemies are placed in such a way that you can tell careful consideration was put into designing these levels.  You have to REALLY put on your thinking cap and find ways to block in, kill or jump over enemies that like to interfere with your ability to cleanly reach the key or exit door.

For example in one level, those electrical sparks spin around platforms.  You have to use your wand and your platform-making skills to block the sparks away in the corner, allowing the other areas of the room to become either accessible or easier to explore.  That's just one example.  There's 50 levels (or rooms) and each one has their own unique design making obtaining the key and reaching the exit door very difficult in its own way.  It's an incredible challenge really, every single room, and one that really tests your thinking abilities.  The game's honestly hard right from the beginning.

All kinds of collectibles are available as well.  It's actually quite confusing to understand the purpose behind them all, but basically if you collect 10 fairies you'll get an extra life.  And trust me you'll *want* those extra lives!  You'll want as many lives as you can get.  It's possible to get over 20 lives total, but I'll never be able to collect that many personally.  Starting off with just 3 lives, and then realizing Solomon's Key is the kind of game that will make you drain lives like crazy since you can easily die in just one hit or one mistake seems like a REALLY dirty trick.

I'm not a big fan of using Game Genie cheats, but in this case I would actually recommend using the Game Genie codes that enable you to start from certain rooms.  There's a series of Game Genie codes you can find on the internet that allow you to start from any room you want.  Avoid any of the invincibility codes if you see those however.  Using invincibility defeats the feeling of satisfaction completing these levels.

But yeah, there's other collectibles, such as Seals that allow you to see the best ending if you can find them all, and Gold Wings that enable you to skip ahead several rooms (six rooms, if I recall).  That begs the question- do I *want* to skip ahead?  The game's really fun, and I love a good challenge!  There's other collectibles that don't have much meaning and are just there for points.  There's also hidden rooms you may or may not find along the way.  So much to find if you want.  The extra lives are the important ones though.

If this is a puzzle game it might be one of the greatest puzzles on the NES.  However there's enough adventure that it's probably not a puzzle game in the true sense.  I'm not really sure.  That's for you to decide.  You're controlling a character in a similar fashion to other adventure games such as Milon's Secret Castle, so I think by default this automatically makes Solomon's Key not a true puzzle.

Is Solomon's Key *too* hard?  Yes, at times, but it's important to remember once you memorize the layout of a room, find the location of all the items and figure out the best way to get around, the challenge goes down.  Maybe not a lot since enemy danger is always looming, but at least a little.

The game's only disadvantage is that the replay value is a little on the low side.  Once you figure out the best way to obtain the key and reach the exit door, well the game's still fun thanks to the adventure elements and the constant barrage of enemy danger (certainly more replay than a normal puzzle game like Tetris in my opinion) but you won't be coming back to this game often.  Either the insane challenge or the fact you have to replay the same rooms over and over just to get back to the point you inevitably got stuck and had a game over lowers the replay.  Getting stuck on room 34 for example, and the hour or two it took to get that far, and then having to do the whole game over when you lose all your lives is NOT fun.  With that said though, you will feel rewarded each time you complete a room.  This is the only reason I'm not giving Solomon's Key 5 stars.  This game is really fun other than that.

Recommended."
351777,4,"So I am only on Chapter 1 Episode 3.  I will get this out now that I have no intention of playing multiplayer.  If I was going to I would lower my rating due to the gross system where you can buy more ""money"" to speed up production of weapons and such.  At the end of the day I can't blame them as it happens on ipad apps and such but those are free to play games.
All of that aside the graphics are very good.  I have read some complaints about cut scene lengths and there is some merit to their arguments.  If, however you played Metal Gear 4 this is nothing new to anyone.  If you expected something else you were probably fooling yourself.  I have yet to discover different game modes so it seems there is one difficulty setting.
The prologue was quite annoying, and having to stare at someone's butt crack for so long was not funny, especially a man's butt crack.  There was little to do in the prologue beyond crawling till them end.
Outside of the prologue the game picked up.  I am not sure if there are time constraints on the missions to explore more, but I really enjoyed the slow place of the missions.  It allowed for me to recon, find out where all of the enemies are and then plan my attack to come in quietly.  I missing the never dying silencer but I think I can cope with that.  So far the story seems intriguing and I am looking forward to rebuilding their base, I hope it allows for a little creativity as far as what you can do with it."

128277,4,"Oh my god,this is the best Star Wars game I'v ever played in my life!
Okay, maybe its not as good as I say it is,but it is still very good.
So anyway, there is this guy called Darth Vader and he is always breathing really heavily , I mean what is he doing?!
And there is this kid named Starkiller and he is an apprentice to Darth Vader.
And then there is this lady named Juno,except she's not pregnent. But I thought Starkiller was going to get her pregnent.
Anyway,Darth Vader is using Starkiller to put together an alliance to strike down this guy called the Emperor, but Darth Vader betrays Starkiller,so Starkiller travels to the Death Star ,which is not yet completed, to kill Darth Vader and save his friends. Then Juno asks if she will ever see Starkiller again, and Starkiller says no,so they make out.
So you fight your way through the Death Star and fight Darth Vader.
You end up blowing most of his mask off and almost kills him.
Then you have to fight the Emperor and he is hard as hell!
Once you manage to beat him you are about to kill him but one of your friends tells you not to.
The Emperor manages to get his strength back and starts electrcuting you.
You make your way through the electricyty and tap the Emperor and you die.
  THE END
P.S
I think there are two endings ,so I'll start another game.
P.P.S
I'll give this 4.5 stars overall.
P.P.P.S
Why is this game so short, I beat in 7 hrs. and 45 min."
89585,4,"Even though this is an old game, I enjoy this game due to action. All is about action on Mortal Kombat. Looks like a new MK game would come out this year!"
220397,4,not much to say about this. Its a controller and it works. No issues with it. I like the XBOX controller design more than the playstation.
468890,4,I chose four stars because the game is fun to play but definitely for a young child. I'm 21 and I enjoy playing the game but it is very kiddish.
413122,4,"Works very well. A little loud when you have everything off. Have some trouble getting controllers to charge with silicone covers on, but it works and cools the PS4 like it should."
100936,4,"This game is almost perfect. It has upconverted textures, full 3D support including an unusual bonus in that when u take a screenshot in full 3D 1920 x 1080p at 24hz it outputs the screenshot at double the resolution when viewing at a later time in photo & fax viewer or paint! So i have screenshots of the game at 3840 x 2160!

The best option for this game though is 1280 x 720p at 60 hz in 3DTV Play via my GTX 660ti AMP edition card on Windows 7 64, enabling the highest settings and 8x AA.

One can even find online multiplayer games for HALO 2 and even access Windows/Xbox live from -in game-!!!
One bad note is that I can't quite get THE MULTIPLAYER to run right on windows 7, the player gets pulled around and is suddenly turned around for no reason.
Can anyone tell me how to remedy this?
Otherwise the game is great!"
73689,4,Works great
347288,4,"I purchased this for $23.98 including shipping and besides the damage that was done to the packaging and product during shipment I would have to say I'm quite pleased! I've been playing Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin more recently so when I stumbled upon this Collector's Edition for so cheap and knowing I don't down currently own the original version of Dark Souls 2 on PC I knew I needed it! It's fresh to play the game as it was when it was originally published! Anyways, to get to the Collector's Edition itself I would have to say I'm pleased with the contents of it. The statue, art book, soundtrack, and steel book are great! The map is also a nice addition to the bundle. The quality of the statue is sub-par but for the price I haven't any complaints. If anyone's curious to know whether or not the game comes with the preorder DLC and digital extras, it most certainly does! Just remember the Collector's Edition doesn't contain the DLC contained within the Season Pass or Scholar of the First Sin; such as Crown of the Ivory King, Crown of the Old King, and Crown of the Sunken King. In regards to installation media, there are no DVDs, just a Steam redeemable key which is housed and included with the soundtrack in the steel book. All in all, I'm happy to be playing the game fluently on my PC while adoring the contents of the CE. I would recommend it!"
400166,4,"Nice headphones, very good feel and comfortable on the ears. The LED lights and the pattern design on the earpiece is interesting. Build quality makes me wonder how long I have until I break them by accident. The sound quality is passable but you can tell it's a bit washed out. It's good enough to use for discord chat. I like that the controls are on the ear piece instead of somewhere on the cord. It prevents accidental mutes and volume changes. I haven't tested the microphone quality but I haven't heard any complaints from my friends' end."
54048,4,"I have already posted a full review of Rise of Nations, so I won't go into many details here. However, in terms of what it adds to the original game, Throne and Patriots is probably the best expansion pack I have ever played.  The new stuff like governments, new units, the four campaigns, and other options simply make the game feel even more user-friendly and realistic.  I never played Rise of Nations without the expansion pack, and it is really hard to tell where the original game ends and the expansion begins.  THey fit together that well.  I have only played the Napoleonic campaign, and it is excellent.  The special units, like the government unit and the generals, add a nice touch to the game without throwing things off balance.  If there is anything lacking in this game, it has to do with sounds and visuals, not gameplay.  To make the game even more immersive, I wish that the special units had just a tad bit of voice acting, like some verbal acknowledgment as they go into action.  Also, the geography could use a bit more diversity--weather changes and day & night cycles would have probably pushed me toward giving this game an outright 5 stars.  Nonetheless, Rise of Nations is definitely a top-10 favorite game of all time for me.  I highly recommend it (and the expansion) to anyone who likes well-done strategy games."
426678,4,"I absolutely loved Bravely Default, one of my favorite games. I found Bravely Second a decent sequel but I was kind of disappointed. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the game but I felt like there wasn't enough new. But maybe for some people a continuing of certain characters is okay and wanted. Overall I'd recommend it if you loved Bravely Default."
473224,4,great
109940,4,"fun, can be difficult at times but lots of fun in couch co-op mode. would recommend playing with a friend.
campaign is like 5 hours with 2 bonus missions to download for free, so like 6-6 and a half hours of entertainment."
411606,4,"Most of the reviews nail it. You either like this game or you don't. This game offers you many things including Space Travel, Unique Planets and Exploration, Survival (albeit watered down), Cataloging, Aliens and more. If you aren't a diverse gamer you won't like this at all, no matter how much you love space and science. If you are open minded, have a curious mind, are a dreamer, love exploring and always seeing something new, you will love this. I typically never give 5-stars to a game unless it gets gold in every event. This game is great but it's not amazing.

After playing Destiny for a solid year starting from Vanilla all the way to Taken King I can say that No Man's Sky was the concept Destiny was lacking (aside from better and bigger lore). Space exploration as a guardian would have bumped Destiny up to 5 (possibly) 6 stars in my book. Its a shame these two games didn't merge to become one. I logged 1000's of hours on Destiny so I can say it's great and No Man's Sky brings to the table what was lacking. Now if No Man's Sky brought more mechanics like more npc interaction, more diverse ecosystems and aliens and went something more towards an exploration MMO. We would never leave. For what it does, it does great and for this I enjoy the game. I haven't finished it but I have spent a lot of time on it.

I expect burnout to happen eventually but as of now I still have many things to discover, languages to learn and of course, to find out who ATLAS is.

A great start for franchises in this category of gaming. I can only imagine what games will stem from this in the next 5 years.

Enjoy."
315268,4,"The game is a great way to live the life of crime you have thought about, however some situations get redundant, and because you are constantly relying on other people games usually turn to a shoot out, there is little chance to get a covert theft. A few of the mission pay the best so you are constantly drawn to them and repeat them to level up. Difficulty doesnt seem to be accurate as some hard levels are simple while some easier levels are more difficult. Overall well developed game and enjoyable."
133055,4,"As a zoologist going into teaching and field work, I am always curious how we present information about the natural world to our children. While ""Dinosaur King"" is a monster farming rpg not unlike Pokemon, the presentation of the dinosaurs is surprisingly realistic when compared to its competitors, such as ""Fossil Fighters"". Further more, it introduces children to basic classification by showing where each dinosaur the player resurrects fits into a very rudimentary dinosaur taxonomic tree.
Even so, the story line is very simplistic and the characters are rather one dimensional, making the game outside of the fossil collecting and dinosaur resurrection rather poor. The fighting mechanic is a good deal of fun, though, being based on rock-paper-scissors with vague hints given to the player as to what the computer's next move will be. This game will be certain to entertain and be enjoyed by younger plays, though it certainly leaves more to be desired by older, casual gamers."
354618,4,Great game
155546,4,"Just Cause 2 is a fun game. I personally enjoy open-world games, so this immediately appealed to me. The game has great graphics, awesome gameplay mechanics and lots to do. The one complaint I have is that there is a very thin plot, and you're never given a reason to care about any developments. Other than that, great game to mess around in."
296402,4,"I was excited to get the set containing Anna, Elsa, and the Frozen-based power discs in one bundle. It was the reason I wanted to make my own Toy Box world. However, there was only one con for both characters. For Anna's, fighting enemies with a grappling hook feels like its almost useless (though the shovel works great). For Elsa's, hers was her personal mini-game that involved slingshots. Out of the other characters mini-games I played so far, Elsa's was the WORST one ever. Other than that, these are definately worth collecting."
21601,4,"History fans rejoice - Empire Earth takes the basic concept from Age of Empires and extends it from the dawn of time all the way to modern times and beyond.  Never have I gotten such a sense of the march of technology and a true arms race against an enemy - this game has over 200 units from every era in history, including pre-historic, the Bronze Age, Middle Ages, Napoleonic, both world wars, modern times and beyond(robots and time travel).  You can play through history or focus on one period in time- each ""epoch"" is a complete balanced game in itself, and there are 14 of them total.  In fact, Empire Earth is so similiar to Age of Empires that you might wonder if the same people made both games - and you'd be right, the lead designer was the same.  The interface, units, sound fxs, even resources are all very similar to the Age of games.  That's a good thing, unless you are burned out on AoE.
This game is entirely about combat, so don't come expecting a real-time version of Civilization 3.  There are 4 campaigns, but the real fun is in the multiplayer and computer skirmishes.  In these games, you can either choose a ""tournament"" game, in which both sides rush through hundreds of years of technology, or a more focused game with only a few eras of advancement, say from WW1 to WW2.  Whatever you choose, you can set the starting era and the ending one.  A great touch is that all maps are randomly generated, and they've included a wide assortment of map-types to fit your style - islands, plains, mountains, mediterrians (inland sea)...
Gameplay-wise, nothing much is new here - you still must micromanage your town and economy, and send troops blindly at the enemy if you hope to win.  Where EE is different from the rest is that it has SO MANY upgrades to its basic units - infantry advances from cavemen to laser shooters - and some basic types are eventually outdated, like archers and cavalry eventually are replaced with tanks and rifles.  The march of time is merciless, you MUST win the arms race to win the game, so the sheer need to constantly research is something new that could not be experienced in any other game.
I was surprised one game when the computer probed my lines with a ""balanced"" assortment with units, and after I had a hard time eliminating the catapults, it sent an army of 30 siege engines and utterly wiped me out.  The computer actually learned from my tactics and changed itself accordingly.  It changes it's attacks pretty regularly, actually, which is a nice change from the AI in some RTS games, which seem to be able to do all things perfectly, at once.  The AI in Empire Earth attacks like a game of chess, moving one thing first, then another, attacking you but leaving itself open for counter-attack afterwards.  The give and take in this game is very saticfying.
The graphics are 3D, and can seem kinda bare until you witness hundreds of units on the screen at once and realize everything in this game is King-Sized.  I liked the scope of the technology, but wished for more of a Civilization-type tech tree, in which one advance leads to the next.  As the game is now, the player simply researches a new ""Epoch"", and once he/she gets there, they are granted access to build anything and everything in it.  Nice, but it tends to make opponents very similiar.  Otherwise, a great game."
52433,4,"I just completed the DEMO of GCII. Being a big GCI fan, it was certainly satisfying to re-experience that universe. Overall impression is that GCII will be a great game (amazing graphics and sound). Regarding gameplay, it seems the game might benefit from a few fixes. (1) Unit pathfinding is sometimes vexing in that units periodically cannot get around other crowding units despite ample room to do so. (2) I also noticed that when you request infantry to FOLLOW an artillery piece that they will continue to push it around randomly once the piece stops moving. (3) Most disappointing is that the enemy AI tends to be somewhat naive in often walking directly in the line of fire (in fact a single enemy infantryman will try to walk directly through a whole crowd of combatants blasting him to pieces). I often saw enemy infantry men pace mindlessly back and forth in open territroy while being bombarded from a distance. It seems the AIs primary directive is to throw repeated waves opponents directly at you. Don't get me wrong - despite these annoyances the game is still alot of fun overall. I just hope the developers can work out some of the AI kinks in advance or soon after release. Keeping my fingers crossed."

372111,4,"Okay so I skipped Disgaea 4 and went to 5 as disgaea games all are very similar and with their grindy nature it is very easy to burn yourself out. With Soo much time put in the original and 2 (both great bits of fun!) I barely managed to beat three because of the burn and skipped 4 not coming back till 5. Why this long story? Well....

It cause this game holds up great! First being going back a step in a series can be jarring as improvements and features suddenly missing can be annoying, but disgaea 4 throws in the same style and tactics you expect and remember from the series with it's own unique system. 2nd Making it a vita port is perfect. The game style really does suit a sit down for a short bit do a level or grind a bit on a bus or work break. Story is still fun quirky bit of camp lovers of the series expects. That being said I did feel story wise this was one of the weaker entries. I would place it 4rth down the list above 3 but behind the rest in that department. Odd music returns and some even get caught in your head after setting the game down.

Honestly the only complaint I have that keeps this from a perfect review is that it is a classic disgaea game. A few new game features are sprinkled in that are not in the others, but 85% of the game is the same gameplay as every other disgaea. Heavy grinding not super accessible to newcomers to the series with it's depth and again just a lot of the same old which can burn you out.

My only complaint atm is Amazon's price was a bit too high at the time of posting. I feel the game IS worth 40 dollars, but it hard to ignore getting it new elsewhere for 30 new and 20 ish used soo minor complaint on price but that should have little effect upon the great game!"
406393,4,It looks good and it plays great! not my favorite in the series in terms of planets and some gameplay with Clank
75371,4,"Microsoft 4k points, i see a few people crying they didn't get points but i can't say why. maybe there not reading the code right ? anyhow now what DLC to grab ?"
20828,4,It is a great game at a moderate price (associating racing with fighting). It takes a while before being redundant.
157724,4,"If it was by Sony then it works a lot better than the off brands.  I give 5 stars for the cool designs like the camo style and others.  Still, these work perfectly and have all the necessary components.  Heck, they were made for the system so why wouldn't they?"
483584,4,Great edition. Very very AWSOME
205687,4,good game! great graphics Rockstar games are always good! I would deff recommend this game! alot of different cars in it!
360399,4,"The remastered versions of Halo 1 & 2 are fantastic - 5 stars all around. I loved playing through Halo 1 & 2 with my son in local co-op splitscreen. When we got to Halo 3 Bungie stopped remastering because I guess they thought it was good enough. The problem is in Halo 3 local co-op splitscreen mode is letterboxed and is annoyingly small, even on a 75"" 4K display - boo. Aside from that we love it."
16453,4,"OK...I am a true 1st person shooter game addict. I used to play the D&D style games on Sega and Nintendo in the way back time!!!
This game was my first return to that genre. I have to say I am enjoying this game. I am not blown away by it, but I do like it. I have read in some forums that Bioware took some of the best things D&D had to offer and threw it all out. I cannot comment since I am not into these games that much.
I like that this game cost me $30 and has kept me busy for days on end resolving puzzles while exploring the Neverwinter world.
I paid $50 for Max Payne 2 and Jedi Academy, yet finished them in 6 to 7 hours of pay time!!! RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!
NWN is a steep learning curve, the potions, spells, charms, and rules were utterly confusing to me and still are! I find the in game descriptions of items to be utterly useless! So I am a bit PO'd about that. The manual does nothing to help you. There should be a wizard to recommend character classes and help newbies pick character based on our game play style. Instead you get a menu of pre-created characters. You are better off reading a good walkthrough, using a trainer program at a cheat site so you can play and learn....THEN go back and do it for real.
Overall, I am enjoying NWN. I think the graphics are just fine. Not breath taking, but not bad either. Just remember this game is a STEEP learning curve...I am near the end and I canot figure out what somethings do or what some items are good for!"
420119,4,kind of fun. Easily played alone.
303290,4,"After the first circuit event (I think 5 races) my Drivatar and my son's Drivatar started squaring off with each other.  We both trade paint and drive fairly aggressive (OK admittedly we haven't turned the damage realism up)...and our Drivatars race the same way.  Also, the track and car detail seems drastically above Forza 4, though admittedly you are getting way less in terms of quantity.  I still recommend it and am having a lot of fun, but the idea that the most expensive cars may be a grind (due to them wanting to sell you tokens) is a valid criticism."
145219,4,"The Perfect Shot is very useful when playing rail shooter games and it functions very well. I noticed a couple fixes that they could changed to make it better. First off, getting the actual Wiimote into the gun is a task in itself. It can take me 10 seconds or it can take me 5 minutes. I currently have 2 which were purchased almost a year apart so I doubt it is an isolated issue. Aside from that, the only other issue I have is that the handle is SO big. Normal handguns aren't even that fat. It's not so much a hinder issue, it is more like an endurance issue. It causes your grip to be a whole lot wider which makes you feel like you have to hold on tighter. Let's just say, I could hold up my old 2 lbs lightgun up longer than this huge handled thing when I first got it. I am more used to it now. I guess it is just something that you have to get used to."
97069,4,My kids like this game. My son chose this one for his birthday. Mario Party 9 would be a better choice in my opinion.
120815,4,Fast shipping.  Works great
132319,4,"I missed this one on release and it got placed in my backlog, just got around to getting it and am about 15 hours in so far. Loving the game, very interesting, sort of like Mercenaries, but your character has a Spiderman-like zip line shot. The world is huge, non-linear, more so that Grand Theft because you do not have to unlock zones. There are two major flaws IMO, one is the lack of destructible buildings, and two, there is no way to save vehicles. I still give it a 4 star for fun, and because I only paid 25 USD for it, but it really is a 3.5 star game overall."
109186,4,my son loves it
196181,4,"it got here in less than 4 days

so i think it will be Exciting for any zelda fan!!!"
171229,4,"Overall, I have to say I like it.  I have the Xbox360 and I am glad that the game is on it.  I enjoyed, off and on, FF11 the MMOG and how it played on Xbox360, so graphically, I'm pleased.  Despite what some people think, maybe it is because I have a good television, but I think the graphics are wonderful.  In terms of the graphics, for some reason, I have better graphics occurring with this game than, say, Dragon Age.  Then again, I will say, like many here, I've loved the FF series for a long time.  I remember it was the first game I purchased with the first Playstation.  So I'm not sure what the debate is all about in terms of graphics and sound quality.  I won't go into the storyline because I'm fairly certain that most of you know about the storyline.

Characters:  The characters are great.  They have their strengths and their weaknesses.  And unlike, say, some of the characters from FFVIII...the characters aren't emo and skaters.  These are real characters that have personalities.  I feel like I care for these characters early on, and want to see them through whatever trials and tribulations they will go through.  The characters I liked playing the most are Lightning, of course, being the ""main character""...which is good in and of itself in that she's a strong and determined character...dark, but not pouting dark like Squall.  Sazh and Vanille are both great characters to have in the party because they help balance out the magic and offensive/defensive movement.  Characters are an important factor to a story.  And I'm happy here.

Problem: one of the problems though is that you have too many characters, and you switch from one to the next fairly often, thus it sometimes gets confusing as to where you are in the story.

Combat:  The combat is tricky. At first you think it is just button pounding.  This can get your party killed quickly, trust me.  You need to know when to change the roles of the characters in order to attack and defend.  You have some option for several attacks during one attack round.  Be sure to take advantage of Vanille's curing abilities.  This will come in handy, as you'll probably, like me, go for the all out onslaught attacks that Lightning has in her lovely hands.  The Paradigm shifts then are a plus.  The preemptive attacks are a plus.  And while some seem to not like not being able to control every little nuance of the other characters, the intelligence behind these characters program is high enough that they can thank and work for themselves and the overall party.

Problem: a problem with combat is that in some instances, you are jumping back and forth between paradigms, and you loss a bit of the trajectory in the combat encounter.

World:  OK, here's where it seems a lot of people aren't happy.  They say that the world is just one straight line.  In some sense they are right.  But that is not always a bad thing, as some have noted, because the storyline speaks for itself.  On the other hand, the world is EMENSE.  The world is huge.  Going through the world you feel as if you are dwarfed by all that is around, whether the characters are going through a ruined city or through a wilderness.  Just because the world seems a straight line doesn't mean you won't need the map...there will always be cracks and crannies along the way to poke one's nose into.  I would say that I don't need a worldmap like, say, Oblivion, in this case.

Problem: this problem is somewhat connected to the combat problem, at times, unlike earlier games where you can run around to get xp, you have a straight line of combat encounters that get repetitive."
187534,4,good but 1st ones better
410388,4,"Do not buy this game if you are a gamer.  It's not the best platformer, the shooting mechanics are bleh, crafting is a joke, it gets VERY grindy towards the end and the story eventually goes flat.  $5 is worth it for the challenge arenas; those are quite enjoyable.

BUT!  If you are a gamer dad/mom, this is well worth your time.  It is a nice little story about a young woman and her pet robots, trapped on a desert planet trying to complete their mission to terraform the world.  The platforming is solid, particularly the challenge areas.  The shooting, while kind of boring, has enough going for it (change the colors, alter the special effects) to keep you occupied.  You are shooting non-anthropomorphic robots, so there are no tough conversations to be had about ""are they really the bad guys daddy?""  Best of all, you have a robo dog, and spider, and hulk, and flyer.  My 4 and 6 y/o girls loved watching the pets.  While I might have rather been playing Gears 4, this was a great game to curl up on the couch with little ones."
29829,4,"I must say that I am mostly impressed.  This game is the first Batman video game I've ever played that I enjoyed (the others, quite frankly, were awful).  The graphics are great, the movement is very fluid, and the animated sequences are fantastic.  They developed no shortage of moves for Batman, such as gliding with his cape, or hiding in shadows against the wall.
The problem is that the game can be very frustrating at certain points due to the limitations in control.  It would have worked much better if its controls were more like Halo and Max Payne, in which you move with one thumbstick and control the viewpoint with the other.  Here, Batman's perspective is limited and you constantly have to press the trigger button when you want to look in the direction that Batman is facing.
The fight scenes are good, as are Batman's martial arts moves, but there are certain parts where it is very awkward and frustrating to maneuver him.  The biggest example of this is when fighting Poison Ivy's minions hand-to-hand; the very slight delay between pressing the button and the execution of the move is just long enough for the plant guy's to knock you on your butt.
Having Batman use the grapple is neat, but very limited: you use the grapple only to certain select spots where they allow you to do it, and not to any surface that would likely be able to hold a grappling hook.  It's not like Spider-Man (which in most ways was obviously Batman: Vengeance's biggest inspiration) where you can pretty much use the web to attach to whatever you want.
The car and plane chases are lame.  There's no other word for them.  The detail is scant, control is very limited and if you deviate even slightly from the set path, you lose and have to restart from the checkpoint.  Basically, it's as if the developers spent five minutes working on the vehicle sequences.
If you compare this game to trend setters such as Playstation's Spider-Man, which set the standard for urban superhero games, or X-Box's Halo, which has amazing graphics, fantastic control and great vehicles, Batman falls a little short.  Still, for anyone who loved the animated series (which I did), it is a heck of a lot of fun to interact in Gotham City, the atmosphere of which the developers flawlessly mirrored for this game.  I was very impressed by the graphics and it was so great that they got the original cast from the cartoon to provide the voices here."
174985,4,"Good product; the kids love them.  Their ""durability"" is a bit questionable, but, really, their reasonable pricing offsets that.  We will buy them again, when these that we have fail.  (We bought 3 of them!)

RECOMMENDED for everybody who just wants to hear their games and ""chat"" with their other online players without needing all of the ""Super Surround, Dolby Stereo, Roomful of Sound"" experience in order to play.

WE like them."
190795,4,"This game represents a new line of Nancy Drew games. Though not a typical hidden object game, it is also not a typical Nancy Drew mystery-adventure game.

First of all, the game has minimal animation, but is made up of flat, 2-D settings. Except for some characters' dialog lines, movement is depicted by placing an object (like a car or a cat) into different spots around the setting.

Second, each discovered hidden item has a purpose. The player uses everything in a refreshingly logical way in order to advance the story. For instance, a light bulb is put into an empty socket in order to see in a dark room, or a slingshot is used to break glass and free a key.

Third, there are fun minigames at the end of each ""chapter"" that, once the game has ended, you can play as often as you like by clicking the Arcade button. The games are arcade-style. I normally don't care for timed, fast-reflex games, but prefer to use my head and NOT be timed! However, these games are fun and relatively easy. If I can do them (a 58 year-old woman) most children and adults can too.

The same actress voices Nancy, and the voice acting is par with the other ND series taken from the books. There is no peril, however, as it is basically a hidden object game, thus there is very little tension or fear-factor.

I enjoyed the challenge of rebuilding a scaffolding by correctly connecting pipes, of catching escaped reptiles and replacing them in their terrariums, and of figuring out the other myriad mysteries that made up this fun game that can be played over and over.

One other neat thing is there are two different endings. The best ending is gained by earning enough points during game-play. The first time I played, I failed to get enough points and was disappointed by the ending. When I played it again, however, I made enough points and saw the ""real"" ending. Very satisfying and well done!"
61343,4,"I'm a huge Punisher fan. I was furious when Max Payne stole Castle's life. But now Frank has stolen Payne's game! You'll be used to the game if you played MP, but this still feels diffrent somehow. The torture feature is amazingly fun, sticking heads into piranha tanks and into boiling water will satisfy the sickness in all of us. Meeting guys like Iron Man, Nick Fury and Black Widow (and surprisingly more MARVEL characters) will keep you coming back for more. While he did steal the Max Payne gameplay, I can forgive Castle. You stare him in the face and say you don't."
17062,4,"This is a great game, if you are a fan of the trilogy.  There are many problems with the game, but the overall atmosphere, graphics, and story make it a keeper.  The biggest flaw is with the control. It is Resident Evil style, but totally lacks any intuition or stability.  It is very, very clumsy.  All in all, this doesn't destroy the game.  It eventually gets easier to control Ash, but you'll never be fully satisfied with the control.  This also makes fights very hard, but almost every monster killed leaves some sort of health power up.  There is also a bit of slowdown whenever there is alot of chaos on screen(especially with the flying deadites).  Oh yeah, it is very, very hard.  But who ever thaught fighting the evil dwellers of hell would be easy. But on to the good points. The game is beautiful, if you find the whole horror thing beautiful.  It is incredibly faithful to its source, and any fan of the trilogy will tell you that this is the most important aspect of the game.  The atmosphere is down right creepy. Perfect.  The graphics are sweet.  The sound is straight up scary.  Its the best sounding horror game since Silent Hill.  I read an interview with Sam Raimi that said this game is intended to be a fourth insallment in the series.  It is a total success there. If you are a fan of the movie, get the game. Just take note of the problems in the game.  Are they game killers? No, not to me.  But I love Evil Dead, and even a less than perfect game does me fine. If your are not a fan, you might want to rent.  Without all the bells and whistles that make Evil Dead fans so happy, the game would probably stink.  This was a total impulse buy for me.  I didn't even know it had been released, I saw it, I bought it.  I had read horrible reviews of the PS version, and I was expecting to really hate the game.  I don't.  I am really enjoying the experience.  It is frustrating, hard, and sometimes annoying, but if you really, really love the films, check out the game."
95395,4,OK
197129,4,"There is always something new to experiment with this game, although nothing really stands out. I must have played racing the VW bus in a figure 8 for at least an hour because I found that to be interesting. The problem was every time I hit a marker or another VW bus I was disqualified. Then I really got into the go-karts for a while. I must admit the go karts are fun, but at the higher levels it's so easy to spin out on the grass. When I spun out, I couldn't recover and I pretty much automatically lost (because the go kart is always facing the wrong way). Both of those games kept me entertained for a while, but the nuisance of being disqualified or spinning out at the intermediate levels and above, I became frustrated.

The most fun I had was using the Benz Stealth car,(pre-order through Amazon) because even if I messed up I was racing a Toyota Corolla, and I could afford to mess up. This game is a driving simulator, so I guess that means no fun. When going into a sharp 105 degree (slightly obtuse angle) curve at 55 mph, and the car doesn't react and crashes STRAIGHT into the wall, that isn't what a great simulator should represent. I had 3 people verify this. NO burning rubber, no skidding, just crashing straight into the wall. I'm not speaking about a hairpin curve. I drive 20 mph for those. On top of that, what kind of simulator has cars crashing into you when you're ahead of them? Aren't they supposed to overtake you by going around?
 Simulator does not equal not fun. Maybe it's different with the wheel. I just don't see what everybody else is seeing. Sorry.

Overall, great cars, great variation, great scenery, graphics, relaxing music, but driving unmodified standard cars and a flawed AI directly hinders the game play and users initial reactions. As one of my PSN buddies said, the game gets better, but getting to the point where you can afford a premium car and modifying it can be a frustrating experience."
158298,4,"I bought it for my son a long time ago, he doesn't use it anymore, but he really had a great time with it!!"
366842,4,"Awesome game so far. The camera takes getting used to but its not a game breaker. The graphics are great and I see some
complaining about it... Really? It was a PSP GAME first! This is much better looking then the counterpart. Love the battle system!"
43717,4,"I was thrilled to see the sequel to my favorite game in years, but a little dissappointed with a few things. First the pros...

The graphics, textures and colors received a fantastic upgrade. The game seemed more vibrant and although I loved the first game, the second installment offered a serious upgrade in this area.

Gameplay was smooth and full of action. I loved having the other marines with me through much of the game; it was a very nice touch.

The Co-op campaign. When will other people follow suit and get a clue!! THANK YOU BUNGIE for putting a co-op campaign in the game. So many other FPS out there are great--ala Call of Duty 2--but they get stuck back on the shelf because I'd rather play with a friend than alone. Bungie earns high marks for this.

Online--this is where Bungie once again shines and realizes what it takes to make a great game even better. Fantastic online options including ""party mode"" lets you play with--get this--your friends. Instead of being forced into games with strangers you can play with your friends. Amazingly, this feature has yet to be duplicated by other manufacturers.

Now the Cons...

The flashlight...for some reason it turns off automatically in the second game, which I don't like. Why? Because it usually turns off when you still need the darn thing, so what is the point of having it? Secondly, it illuminates about as well as a match even when it is on.

Level design--they dropped the ball again, just like in the first game. The first three levels were incredible and I loved them, but later in the game they just got sloppy.

Having to drop your weapon when you do a melee attack during dual wield is just plain silly.

Personally, I could certainly do without the levels playing as the covenant. It was implemented well enough, but frankly I wasn't interested.

The ending--absolutely horrible. I know the first game got bashed a bit for the ending, but i liked it. Driving the warthog out of the exploding Pillar of Autumn was cinematic and dramatic. The second game--worthless. The fight seems to stop right in the middle--the end--you're done.

The weapons--although I thought the rifle in the first game was underpowered, I thought they made the problem worse with the 3-shot burst version in the second game. The punch of the gun may have been stronger, but you only had three shots per burst which in the end made it far worse than the gun in the first game. Lets talk about ammo capacity on it--108 rounds....are you joking? Its a useless piece of weaponry, drop it and grab ANYTHING else. And the shotgun wasn't up to snuff either. Do you mean to tell me that with all this space-age weaponry they can't offer a semi-auto shotgun?

Overall a fantastic game but probably not quite at the level it should have been. Hopefully bungie will finally get the level design problem fixed for the third installment and really go all out. The replay value on this game is unsurpassed because of the online play, but I just couldn't give it five stars because even with all the improvements Bungie still repeated some old mistakes."
476790,4,"First I'm running this game on Windows 7 with no problems.  I have been gaming since the days of Wizardry.  I like role playing games and Adventures of the ""Monkey Island"" type.  This is a lot like a ""Monkey Island"" game and if you listen to the dialog and search everywhere you should be able to finish the game without help.  There are walkthroughs on the internet should you need one.

Things you need to put up with.  Long startup times.  The game creates a ton of saved games which slows down startup.  What I did is before quitting I kept my personally named save game and the last machine saved game and deleted the others.  It still has a long load time but I feel better about it.  This is a VERY wordy game.  Characters talk incessantly and sometimes you need to go through quite a bit of the conversation before you trigger the phrase you need to get beyond a certain point.  The game does have ways to skip over cut scenes and individual pieces of dialog.  It also has fast ways of moving around but they aren't redily apparent.

The game itself is fun and the story is well written and well worth the $[...]."
88178,4,"Very well wrapped. Let's play it soon. But we have commented that despite being of guns, supports for team play"
126328,4,"I love the GOW series and like everyone else was looking forward to it's release.  There's little more for me to add that hasn't been said about it.  But... my own take on what I liked and disliked...

I enjoyed the gameplay and weapons.  They found a few creative ways to introduce new weapons and they were pretty easy to use.  I also enjoyed the beautiful cinematics and definition of the characters and surroundings.  Like most people have already noted, it's a visually stunning game that you want to play in HD.  And I also liked some of the new characters that they introduced (for you to slaughter).  The puzzles weren't that challenging if you took a step back and looked, and the story was good.  The action is outstanding, the combos are fun & easy to figure out and the intimate battle-sequences are also fun.  Speaking of intimacy... being as it's the last in the series, even that part is a fantastic send-off.  lol  It was challenging, sometimes infuriating until you could really settle down and figure out exactly what you needed to do - which seems fitting given the installment.  What I didn't care for in the game was that there actually were a few bugs here & there.  For instance, sometimes you could stand in the 'save' spot without R1 showing up - maybe it was just accessing the hard-drive, but sometimes it took longer than others.  Like someone else mentioned, I also didn't like how they colored the switch from normal-> easy mode if your character dies several times, etc.  Basically, if you weren't paying attention you could set it to easy on accident because you figure that red is highlighted/brighter.  That's bad news because it usually wasn't the enemy attack's that would kill you the quickest/the most times, rather the jumps, vents, etc.  The ending did seem fitting, but I'm stil mixed about it - the overall story was fair but I think you could tell that different studios worked on the game because there were some holes in the story & it didn't have a real seamless continuity IMO.

I'd definitely recommend checking it out.  It was a fun game, and not one that I put down until I finished, which I can't say for a lot of others.  If I could give one hint to the game while you're going through it the first time - without giving away too much SPOILER - so don't read unless you've at least played the demo:  make sure that you understand how to use Helios head.  Specifically, lighting up spaces with embers, etc.  Something I realized almost too late!  Oh, and I thought the voice-actors were good.  Malcolm McDowell, Rip Torn (fitting!)... good there as well.  Good game, I definitely enjoyed it though I have to admit, they picked the right time to end this series."
289327,4,"Pros: Mouse is great, I have both G700 and G700s. They both have very good feel. I LOVE using them.

Cons:
* The cable that comes with the mouse sucks. It's too thick, too stiff, making the cabled configuration unpleasant. I bought Monoprice ""Premium USB to Micro USB Charge & Sync Cable 6ft- Black"" as the mouse cable when I need to charge it. Much better!
* Not sure about the quality of the switch used. After using my G700s for a couple months, the left click sometimes register as double click. It's so darn annoying.
* The logitech software is too darn fancy for my taste. Luckily I only need to use it to reprogram the mouse and the program seems to be saved into the mouse itself."
186785,4,I really enjoyed it.
156036,4,"When I initially bought the game it would randomly crash.  I put it aside for a couple of months and then came back to it one day.  Once it was patched and I used a headset instead of the on board sound, it worked flawlessly.  I personally found this to be one of the best games I have played and for the current price it is a killer deal.  Have fun!"
122764,4,"This game is definatly for metal heads, you'll love seeing every gameplay aspect adapted into metal references, it's pretty fun game and i think a good way to expose to someone the awesome world of metal. literally :P"
450493,4,"This game is by far the easiest in the series. This is like a warm up for Adventures of Lolo2&3. But it is a fun puzzle game for casual gamer and I would recommend this to all. But that being said, if you beat this as a kid It is not that enjoyable playing it again unlike 2&3. So if you did play this as a kid buy 2 then 3 those are hard!

Don't buy if,

You played it as a kid

Easy games are not enjoyable to you

You can't stand repeating music

Buy if

You never played it before

Want to teach your kids how to play the NES

You enjoy puzzle games.

Don't let the 4 star review fool you about the 2nd and 3rd games in this series. Those are 100 times better than this one and I consider Adventures of Lolo 2 to be my favorite puzzle game of all time."
101478,4,"The Good: Perfect port of UMK3 and Puzzle Kombat is a blast, online play makes it that much sweeter, second screen used for finishing move and special move lists, swappable screens

The Bad: The bad parts of UMK3 still exists, graphics are slightly blurry, Puzzle Kombat's graphics dumbed down, not much in modes

When Midway announced Mortal Kombat: Unchained for PSP Nintendo fans screamed that they wanted one as well. They got their wish with a port of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Puzzle Kombat from MK: Deception thrown in. Here you have a perfect port of both with responsive controls, and a useful bottom screen that shows finishing moves and special moves. All the characters from UMK3 are here plus some unlockables. There's not much to say other than the controls work well and I could pull off fast combos online while dishing out Fatalities and Animalities left and right.

A couple of small gripes is that the -ality position isn't listed on the bottom screen so you kind of need to experiment, and the time to pull off the fatality is like 4 seconds so you get one try. I also found the graphics slightly blurry due to the low resolution and small screen, but it's only noticeable to people who played the classics a lot. I also found the Puzzle Kombat graphics were toned down a bit even more so than on the PSP. Overall this isn't a huge package, but enough to satisfy fans and online play is the best way to go.

Being able to make the fight screen on the top or bottom is a nice feature, but the problems from UMK3 still exist like ridiculous AI, combos are hard to pull off, and forget beating Shao Kahn unless you cheat. I just wish there were some more modes that could have been thrown in or maybe a few more arcade ports, but what's here works well and feels great to play and come back to."
341974,4,"I bought this a few weeks ago and it works exactly as it says it will. It firmly holds my Kinect and keeps it from falling, which is a good thing. My only complaint is that the set-up instructions aren't the clearest. They can at times be confusing and additionally, the instructions had a huge price tag thing on it that wouldn't come off cleanly, so some instructions were completely covered up. Overall, this is a good product, but set-up may take a while."
353233,4,"I remember watching gameplay trailers, and my expectations were high. Some of the features were scrapped, and while still a solid game, I wish what they showed in early development made it to the final product."
312723,4,I think the cost makes this a bit of a ripoff but i like it!  i don't think it'll pay for itself but it sure is much more convenient.
441317,4,Very fun game
139017,4,"I'll admit I never played any of the other Diablo games but it's hard to agree with complainers saying that this is a bad game.  Upon completing the game on Normal difficulty which was quite easy I immediately started over and continued to level on Nitemare difficulty.  Without question it's a fun and addictive game.

I enjoyed Atari and Nintendo in the 80's and 90's but I'm not looking to revist the games in 2012.  Move on people. Diablo 2 came out 12 years ago.  Blizzard is trying something new."
333705,4,"Offering Digitial codes for PS3 games is genius.

Not a FPS fan so haven't spent much time playing, I mainly bought it because of the special price.

From what i've played so far it's a great game with an engaging single player story & equally good multi-player on-line experience."
103423,4,"This game puts you straight away into the action as you first person shot your way through bodies after bodies of dead people and hideous monstrosities.  The game holds a feel of you against, pretty much the whole world at this point.  Even though you have ""side kicks"" you could pretty much stop shooting and die within minute while your side kick looks at you and says ""What?"", because they don't do anything.
Instances in the game are ridiculous to try to survive without getting minorly hurt while fitting.  Some creature in fact attack so fast at time you have no chances to get a shot off.
Overall the game takes your player through all kinds of new story land from the beginning train and mansion, through Raccoon city, and beyond.  The game has many levels and a very good playing time with multiple special feature levels which open all sort of new story lines and things to...um worry about...later on in the game.
Having the Wii guns for this game makes the experience a whole lot more fun, however you require holding the gun in a weird way because you must push the button on the top very frequently or you miss the much need upgrades and items to pick up."
455918,4,"Doesn't feel exactly like a the Microsoft controller.  The joysticks are a little too snappy and of course it doesn't sit in the hand the same because it has a different shape.

But.  Logitech peripherals are always solid and reliable, not like some of the horrible off-brand controllers that I grew up with (Matcatz, Niko, etc.)  I wish it felt just like the real deal, but it's a small price to pay for a cheap, cordless controller that is so reliable.

Oh and the receiver that you plug into the Xbox is big and ugly, but it's mainly because it's also a port for memory cards, instead of having them on the controller, which I don't like anyway."
159405,4,"Okay so the best part of Wii for me are games like Just Dance and Zumba. If you have to do dance moves and push buttons and arrows it is hard to enjoy the game and just get into the moves and grooves. So that is one of the down sides of this game. Also, it uses the numchuck and remote so great for small kids but even my 10 year old daughter struggles with the limited arm span (due to making moves with a short cord between the two controllers). Also, as the cheers get harder there are more button sequences to push so you never really get realistic dances going. THE POSITIVES ARE IT IS A GOOD CHEER STARTER GAME FOR THE PRICE TO SEE IF IT IS YOUR CUP OF TEA!!!! I know now that I will stick with Just Dance games, Zumba, and I can't wait for the Country Dance out in March. If I can dance and groove and get good at the moves it is fun exercise and challege but if you don't like the button sequences go a different route. I would try the ""other"" cheer game read the reviews it uses two controllers so you don't struggle with the numchuck cord but it sounds like you still do button sequences as the main part of the game. It is sad but I think designed that way so lazy kids can sit on the couch and just push buttons instead of getting up and moving. Even my daughter dislikes the button stuff and just wants to dance and work on her cheerleading moves!!!!!"
167670,4,"So I assumed this would be a quick attempt to cash in on Bond once again. I've seen a new Bond game emerge every few years and with the exception of Goldeneye, they have been pretty mediocre. Solace is a very good game. It FEELS like a Bond game should. You never once forget that you are the coolest spy that ever lived while playing Solace, and for me, that's how it should be. If you like Call Of Duty play mechanics wrapped around the world of a spy, this is your game. The designers also took advantage of the XBox 360 in the graphics department. Solace doesn't look rushed. The environments are lush and beautifully realized. The weapons are cool and the audio is film quality. I rented this game, but now that I am done with Call Of Duty: World At War, I may buy it. Sure, at its heart it's just another first person shooter, but it's cool enough to own a spot next to the best."
79007,4,"Ubersoldier is a decent First-Person-Shooter; made better due to the fact that I ACTUALLY OWN IT, unlike Half-Life2, SIN: Emergence and any other Valve Software controlled game.

For those who don't know: Steam is the new method Valve software has to monitor your gaming experience by selling you 1/5th of the actual game, then making you download the rest. To make matters worse, you have to ask Valve for permission to play one of their games by signing on on-line EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO PLAY THEM.

UberSoldier is a decent game with decent graphics and good game play, made better by the lack of police-state spyware like Steam.

So KUDOS to the makers of UberSoldier, for selling me 100% of the game - what I paid for in the first place."
94278,4,"By chance I came across Super Swing Golf and decided to take a look at it.
The game itself is like a low spec version of PS2 based ""Minna no Golf"" (Japan) but adds some interesting features.

The game welcomes you with several easy listening bossa nove style melodies that runs through the whole game.

I would say it ranks close to ""Minna no Golf"", so above the  Wii Sports mini Golf game version.

While WII Sports Golf version gives you 4 types of Golf clubs, you will have 14 with Super Swing Golf.

If you decide to play against the computer, than every Golf course starts with a challenge dialog. It goes along the line that once you enter the Golf course somebody will come up to you and tell you off. On which you suggest to make a challenge game. (The winner stays)

When doing a match with the computer you will be interested to find out the different levels of your golf partner player.

So their level might vary from beginner to professional and this is also a sympathy point for the game. Once you know your skill level you can choose a ""partner"" with similar skills.

Its so much more interesting than playing against somebody who is much stronger or weaker.

Some other interesting features that make the game very approachable are features like you can change the clubs behaviour to left or right handed etc.. You can also dress your character the way you want, just choose the shirt, pants, shoes etc that fits your personal style.

While playing you can make your displayed character transparent so you can actually see the area that would usually not be viewable from your view from behind the character.

But what really sets this game apart from f.e. Wii Sports Golf version is the waste amount of fancy animations, characters and golf scenarios.  This is what really makes it so much fun to play.

Summary:

It is currently the most professional Golf type game on the WII platform. The many features, the easy listening type music, beautiful scenarios and fancy animations make you easily forget where you actually are. So its a very relaxing game, and that is what Golf is actually about.

If you want to be picky on the game, here are my complaints:

1) I found that the handling of the camera views need some getting used to.
2) The game itself should have some more features like similar Golf type games on other console platforms.

Anything else than that, just enjoy !!"
102567,4,"I usually start my game in 1901 and go far into the future.  It is fairly easy for me to win most of the World Series titles even on the most difficult setting.  I guess that's not too realistic, but the fun is in the numbers-setting new records, getting 300 wins, getting 3000 hits setting the single season HR so high even Bonds couldn't break it, etc.  I also enjoy learning the history of old time players.  Baseball Mogul makes me so curious about the players I look them up on Wikipedia.  My baseball knowledge has grown immensely because of the game.  Some of those old-timer were really characters such as Rube Waddell or Mike Donlin.  Whenever I start a new game from 1901 I find myself trading for my favorite players.  Roger Bresnahan probably tops list.  My line up is never complete unless Roger is the catcher.

As another reviewer stated it is fairly easy to get an all-star lineup, but having all-stars does not guarentee a title.  In the game I am playing now my starting rotation includes Walter Johnson, Pete Alexander, Dutch Leonard, Herb Pennock and Eddie Cicotte.  Not exactly slouches, but I've finished 2nd the last two seasons after a string of 5 titles.

I deducted 1 star because of bugs.  Even with the latest patch(10.14?)
 there are some problems."
341569,4,Pretty sick console and game. Would recommend buying a additional larger memory card.
13808,4,"The setup of the Dreamcast controller is cool and it comes in different colors. This one happens to be blue and it's just like the other controllers. It's not hard to get used to this controller and just like the others it can hold tremor packs and the VMUs. The only set back is that the cord comes out of the front instead of the back. There is a little hole that you can put the cord through but it would've been better if it was just put through the back so it wouldn't be in your way while you're playing. Overall, it's a cool controller."
463068,4,"Sorry to say but reviewer N.Durham is wrong. The Sega Saturn version of MKII is NOT arcade perfect (no version was arcade perfect) nor is it the best version. The Saturn version has different/wrong music, sound effects that are completely missing, freezes while you play, long load times (yes I know its CD but they are still long enough to be bothersome) etc. Just watch a YouTube comparison video and you will clearly see and hear it. The best home versions (and being closet to the arcade) was the Super NES and Sega 32X versions. Though for me personally, the 32X is overall the best version.

On the 32X the graphics are great, gameplay is very smooth and fast (I find it a bit more smoother and responsive then the Super NES version) and there are NO LOAD times between matches, and NO LOAD times when Shang Tsung morphs to another character.

Probe Entertainment was responsible for developing every home version (except the Super NES, that was developed by Sculptured Software) and overall they did a fantastic job when it came to all versions EXCEPT the Saturn. The Saturn version is playable but if you want the BEST version then the 32X is where it's at."
128076,4,"works well, good sound, good voice pick up fits well"
100292,4,"By the way, Susan Gill's son wrote this.  Ok back to the point.

  Pros:  The controls on this installment are unique to say the least.  Flicking the wiimote and nunchuck for spider-man's left or right hand was pure genius.  The controls seem a little odd at first, but to be honest I thought that they pulled it off quite nicely.

  One of the main features of the game that everyone looked forward to was that you got to play as black suit.  The mechanics are simple in this installment.  Once you unlock him (which was early on in the game)you can switch between them at will.  When you play as black suit, your faster stronger, and you get to use every combat move before you unlock it for the red suit.  The catch is that once your rage meter fills up a black haze comes over the screen and starts to envelope it.  If you don't switch out soon, you'll pass out, and if you were doing a mission you fail it.

  The new gang missions are definitly a step up in the game.

  Also another feature in the game was a new thing called cinteractives.  It's basically all that button pressing stuff like in kingdom hearts 2 or god of war.

  Cons: The graphics could have been WAY better on this game.  The wii has an engine that's like 10 or 5 times bigger than the original xbox.  The graphics wouldn't have been as good as the next gen, but it should have come close.  Spider-man looks a little better than sm2's, but his costume's eye things look disfigured.  The black suit's eyes look better, but his suit annoyed me because of how flat it looked compared to the next gen's which was alot shinier.  If you don't believe me here's an example.  You know times square?  The place with all the lights and stuff?  It's still there, but geuss what? NO LIGHTS!!! Nothing at all! There's hardly any room for detail at all.

  One of the biggest dissapointments was the fact that it had no sewers or subway sytems!  They were backed down to be made interior levels.  Even though they had subway entrances all around the city they were blocked up!  They could have easily scaled down the city to make enough room for a sewer and subway system( and believe me the city is humongous).

  Even though you can roam around in black suit as much as you want as long as you don't go into rage mode (and don't worry, it takes a fair amount of hit's just to get into rage mode) you only get him until after you beat the game.  After you beat it you have to find 50 spider emblems to get it back.  The downside, it's a humongous city!  The good side is that once you get it you can control rage mode.  I don't know if it means that you could stay in it for as long as you want, but I don't know cuss I haven't gotten them all... yet.  There is only one other set of tokens in the city: meteorite's.  There are exactly 100 of them, but once you get them all, you get to play as venom.  I'm not quite sure if he's his own character or if he's still spider man only he looks like venom.  As before, I haven't gotten them all... yet.  Another good thing is that it's easier to unlock venom on the wii ps2 and psp than on next gen systems.  You see, if you get pretty close to them, they make a noise that get's louder as you get closer.  The spider emblems are kinda hard to find, the meteorites are alot easier cuss there always out on buildings in the open, but it makes it a whole lot better to find them if you turn up the tv a little and just listen.  You'll know what I mean if you get the game.

  I hate to say it, but there are glitches in the game.  I can't really give any examples because I would have to make this review way bigger than it already is.

  The story unfolds by itself.  This may not sound all that bad, but the next gen system allows you to pick which villian you want to fight in the villians own story line.  There were 10 villians on the next gen systems including the movies villians, but there were only 8 on the wii, ps2, and psp's.  That makes only 5 villians not including the movie's villians.  It's kinda like as you move on in the story they set up the order of which villian you were going to play against.

  The combat was definitly improved since sm2.  Villians can dodge but only a one type can, but now you get to vault over them and start pounding the heck out of them.  But dodging is a completly redone thing.  All he does now is just roll out of the way. On the next gen he actually dodges and then can attack again.

  The gangs were also different on next gen.  On the next gen a specific area was given to 3 gangs.  On the wii, ps2, and psp's there are scattered areas with 4 different types of gangs. What I mean is that there's a dragon tail gang here and waste tribe gang there... you get the point.  Of course, I guess it all depends on which one would suit you best.

  All in all, there are qualities I like about both games.  Like the fact that the camera is better on the current gen.  The next gen with all its extra, perhaps better, content like swimming.  I'm going to buy it on the pc cuss it was based off of the 360's version, and you can swim.  I think I'll keep both games in the end though. That way I can balance it out.  And before you go off doing the same thing that I'm gonna try and do, look at the power it takes for the game.  It's apparently pretty big."
182264,4,"I bought this game for my 8-year-old son. He's done a lot of dance (jazz, tap, ballet, hip hop), and also plays afro-cuban hand drums, so he has an amazing sense of rhythm. Unfortunately, he had a lot of trouble with the ""flick."" I will say, he has a little trouble with fine motor skills, but I thought his sense of rhythm would 'over-ride' that. Well, he couldn't get past the intro.

However, I got totally hooked. I haven't made it past the first 'level', but I'm getting better at it. My son had to demand I give his DSi back, otherwise I'd be playing right now. So, I'm looking forward to getting past the beginning parts, and think I'll be stealing his DSi every chance I get. But a word of caution. It does take a certain amount of fine motor finesse to play."
353570,4,"*No PLOT spoilers but the following will talk about the ending to DA:I*

I will not talk here about the technical problems that come with playing this on PC as this review is based solely on my opinion of the game. It was AWESOME - up until the ending. There were some minor things I didn't quite like, but for the most part, the game was superbly designed.....again, until the ending. The ending was absolutely one of the worst endings I've ever experienced in a game - especially when I had dedicated 150+ hours into it; finishing all the side missions, accumulating all that power, saving every 5 minutes and reloading to make sure all my choices were just right....and the ending basically said everything I so meticulously built in game didn't matter. I can't describe how lost, sad, and frustrated I felt. So the ending made what would have been a 5 star review to 4 stars. The game is still a fantastic experience and I would urge anyone to play - but really try to enjoy the journey as much as you can 'cause the destination will leave you wanting. This article also voiced my discontent quite eloquently, in case anyone wants to read more: http://johnswritersblock.com/2014/12/02/ending-dragonage-inquisition/"
39414,4,"This Zelda game back in the early 90s made up for the 2nd game being a piece of crap. The world map is big with a light and dark world map making the game twice as big. There lots of new items like the pegasis boots for running, the master sword, and the mirror for switching to new worlds. If you did like the origonal game you will love this one. So I say you should check this game out. There is a 2nd game on this besides A Link to the past, The 4 swords. I haven't played it since you need 4 friends with the game, but buying it for just A Link to the Past is still not a waste."
57820,4,"Far Cry Instincts for the Xbox is a really fun shooter that has an insane single player game and an even better multiplayer experience. Throughout the single player game, you go through many different levels that all play extremely well. Unlike the PC game, this console version is very straight forward, usually with a go from A to B kind of feel. This isn't a bad thing in any way, especially since there are usually small areas with a couple ways to complete the task at hand. Overall, the gameplay is amazing and is truly a great FPS shooter. One thing I loved while playing this game was the stealth aspects you can use. You can crouch and stay prone which will allow enemies to not suspect you coming. You can also set up traps which once you get the hang of it can be a lot of fun. You can also throw rocks and stones to trick your enemies to think you're somewhere else, which allows for a quick unsuspecting kill. The last huge thing that makes the single player experience so exciting the feral abilities. When using these, your character (Jack Carver) uses his animal instincts and turns into a whole new person. He has this one ability where, if close enough to your enemy, you can lunge toward and send your enemy flying through the air. This is SO much fun and my favorite of all the different abilities. There are also abilities including night vision and super speed which are very fun too.

The best thing, in my opinion, is the multiplayer aspect of this game. There are the basic deathmatch and team deathmatch, along with other modes including Steal the Sample (probably my favorite, plays much like Capture the Flag). There is a lot of diversity in the maps which makes for a great online experience. Another great thing about the multiplayer experience is the insanely good map editor. This is something that I've always thought would make a great addition to a game, and this game has it...YAY! There is also the fun Predator mode which is also addicting and fun. Overall, this game rocked and the multiplayer is equally as fun!"
155217,4,"This is a very useful accesory for the wii controller. I wanted to be able to use the wii remote and the nunchuck completely wireless and that's why I got this, and it does its job pretty good.

It really feels much better without the cable, and more in games where you have to move a lot. I've been playing this with games like Punch Out were, of course, you need to punch and it came in perfectly. Also if you don't need to move a lot it is useful if you just want to lay down in your couch and play in a comfortable position no matter how separate your hands are from each other and without a cable interferring. I don't regret in getting it and totally like playing completely wireless.

The reason why I give it a 4 and not a 5 is because I've been having some small problems with its functioning. Sometimes it just stops moving suddenly and doesn't respond. I don't know if it is because I have hit it too hard or something, but it happens occasionaly. Now I figured out that I just have to stop the game, unplug (in the Wii remote), wait for the light to stop blinking, plug again and turning it back on. Nothing too complex. This is my only complaint, but could be my bad if I have affected it in some way, though I don't think I have harmed it too hard.

Overall, a great product, I really recommend getting it, it will make your experience better."
267971,4,"First of all let me start with the fact that this item is shown on Amazon as a fit for the PS3 Super Slim (not this ad) but I have both a slim and a super slim PS3 and the super slim slides around in this like soup in a bowl so don't get it for your super slim PS3. Not to this item as used for the PS3 Slim. The Slim fits very well. This horizontal cooling device is perfectly shaped to drop the PS3 slim into. It only raises the overall height by about an inch and has three USB ports on the front to charge your controllers. It's not much but when you turn it on, its makes a lot more noise that you would think that two small fans would make. It's not crazy, but it is noticeable. I'm still getting some lag on my games and I just installed a 72RPPM 1TB hard drive so I know it's not that but the lag ranges from an hour into game play all the way back to lagging 10 minutes after I start so I'm unsure if it's my console still or this cooling device is not really helping. I'll leave that confirmation for after I play a different game and see if I still get lag and when. I still recommend this product."
107321,4,"I purchased this game because I wanted to try something new. I love RPGs and this game seemed to have those qualities with a sick twist. This game is a lot of fun and has some good graphics. The quests are not incredibly hard to do and you do have an Advisor who helps you somewhat in the game. You start out with 10 minions (brown - melee type) and as you progress through the game you are able to acquire more (red - fireball ranged attack, green - sneak attackers, blue - healers and resurrecters of dead minions). The red minions have the ability to clear fire obstacles, green minions have the ability to clear poison obstacles and the blu minions are able to cross water. You can summon minions by killing animals or people and taking their lifeforce. But, just running around and having them cause mayhem and destruction is loads of fun. Even their little comments as they find treasure like ""for the Overlord"", ""mine!"", or ""for you!"" are just riotous. Their thirst for blood and destruction is immsense. As I through a fireball into a wheat field where some pesky halflings were and set it on fire they all jumped up and down cheering me on shouting ""Burn, burn!!"". They will even take the faces of their dead victims and wear them, as well as take any weapons they find. Your minions are fairly easy to direct with the RT button and you can have them stand their ground by posting a flag with the Y button. The minions will follow you everywhere, even to their own death. As the Overlord you have the ability to forge better weapons and armor and can improve the stats by sacrificing minions. Getting around from place to place is fairly simple as well. Everytime you find a new area a transporter pad appears so whenever you are in your tower, you can port right to that zone. The only thing I hated about this was that if I left a zone even for one minute via the port pad just to go to the tower and returned, all the mobs respawned and I had to kill them all again.

My three major gripes about this game are the lack of any map system at all, the inability to view quest details in depth and the inability to change the camera. Not having a map makes things very difficult. I was in the Elven Forest and kept walking around in one big circle for about 30 minutes because I could not figure out for the life of me where I needed to go or where I had not gone yet. This ""no map"" frustration only becomes more frustrating as you accumulate quests. You will see a list of active quests in the quest log but then you have no idea exactly where you picked it up or where you need to go. For example, my quest log said I needed to get a wench for my tower. All I knew is that I got that quest in Mellow Hills. It's not as though I got it from a specific person and even if I did, guess what, we cannot interact directly with NPCs. Now, that in and of itself is not bad but I guess I just got spoiled with other RPGs that helped you better track what you were doing or needed to do. Lastly, the camera sytle is pretty much ""third person, chase cam"". Which just means it follows you around so as you turn, it turns. However,not being able to change the camera angle at all really inhibited some attack tactics because I could not always readily see where enemies were and strategically place my minions. However while struggling for optimal placement, I at times found msyelf in full view of enemies and  would get attacked. But thankfully my minions are always willing to die for me, so no worries. :)

I can still give the game a 4 star rating because it is strategic and will keep you occupied for many hours. Heck it took me about 8 hours just to get all of the minions. It's just a matter of getting over not having a map and not being able to change your camera style."

31243,4,we all remember Goldeneye for the N64.  But this is fantastic.  The story plot is very well done and the multi-player is awesome!  I was desperately in need for an FPS to go with my Gamecube library.  So I found out about 007 and tried to earn money for it as soon as I could.  This is my second favorite Gamecube game.  My first is SSBM obviously.  This game has a very good story plot and very nicely done graphics.  You will love James Bonds next adrenaline video game adventure.
17813,4,"This game has a great solo campain but the multi-player is where it is at in my opinon. There is a lot of weapons to choose from as well as characters and unlockables.

Gameplay: Pretty straight foreward. I have found something cheap in it with the AI. They are cheap when with fully automatic weapons you hear a bang and you are dead. Well that is how it is for me.

Sound: Pretty real... not much more to say..

Story: Not to complex.

Overall: A great buy for the multi-player. The single player is fine but no where near as fun as the multi-player."
51628,4,"But I prefer Grand Theft Auto III... Why? Well, the setting

on GA3 to me is just more interesting. It doesn't have some

of the weapons and stuff. And there is no mall to go into.

However, I miss the subways and some of the missions were

alittle more enjoyable. It's really tough because other

than these things it's basically the same game. The GTA3

was more fun to me."
306364,4,"tl;dr: It's okay--but the gonzo violence doesn't match with how serious the game wants to be. Four stars for technical excellence, only three for fun.

There's much to like about Watch Dogs, an openish-world game set in a near future Chicago, but I didn't find it compelling. Decent graphics and interesting game play gives you lots of options to solve problems--you can walk in blazing, sneak around, and use environmental tools to distract and blow up your enemies. It's a rich world, but ultimately dissatisfying. Why?

I think its because Watch Dogs sets itself to be a grim, serious, interesting techno-thriller, but ends up being a good but not great stealth and hacking themed Grand Theft Auto knockoff. The game opens with a very dark, well-produced segment where the player character faces some tragedy as the outcome for his hacking activities. Fast forward a year and you're trying to figure out what happened and get revenge for the death of your niece. Ok, motivation. Got it. From there, you get to run around hacking phones, jacking cars, doing minor and major missions.

The main problem with the game is that is not nearly as serious as it would like to be. It is hard to take Watch Dogs seriously when you run over multiple civilians and have gun fights in the street without attracting police attention, but if you steal the wrong person's car, the wrath of justice falls down on you.

That said, if you take it for what it is: which is a variation on the Grand Theft Auto theme with light collectible/role playing game elements (you can choose which skills to improve and buy weapons, all of which appear magically from your Trench Coat of Holding), Watch Dogs can hold your interest for a long time. Running enemies off the road, hacking cameras to blow up power grids and incapacitate bad guys, and hacking everything in sight is pretty fun.

There's also an interesting aspect that other players can hack you during the game. This starts a mini-game in which you have to apprehend the other player before he finishes hacking you. On the downside, there do not appear to be enough players to make this viable. Although I got hacked a couple times, I haven't been able to find a game to hack myself.

Overall, an interesting but not amazing game. It hits all the technical points but fails the basic test of making me want to keep playing."

453545,4,Very weird game HARD to beat
36918,4,"I got this game after I played the Gamecube version and this one is alot better.

Pros-

.quidich better than the first game
.creative spells
.the bean bonus room(if you have the most house points you get to in a room to collect bertie botts beans which you can use as curency)
.you can redo challenges
.there is more challenges in the Chamber of Secrets. In the NGC one when you enter the chamber you fight the heir without going through some challenges

Cons-

.the Nimbus 2001 cant do anything
.there is a time limit in spell challenges and there realy is no point because I can get them done in a quick amount of time
.a little too easy
.No transfigeration class
.graphics could be a little better but it sure a whole lot better than the 1st game"

182687,4,"Most come to fear movie licensed games as quickly put together tie-ins that ultimately end up being terrible. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is such a breath of fresh air in the movie licensed games arena. Though not perfect, it manages to capture the feel of the movie, the comic, and expand on both, giving you a full experience playing as Wolverine.

The locations are highly detailed, particularly the jungle and New Orleans segments. The character model of Wolverine is very detailed and the way you take damage shows on the model in the form of clothing and skin being torn away and then the skin grows back over. Really cool visuals. The cutscenes vary from on the fly rendering to typical CGI scenes and all look very nice and move the story along. (One note, not all characters look like the actors from the movie. Most do, but not all.)

The sounds and music are all solid and help with the mood of the game. Voice acting is rather good as well.

The enemy AI is very tough at times as a lot of enemies are thrown at you at one time. The fast/strong attack and combos, mixed with special powers/attacks makes dispatching them fun and visually interesting. There is plenty of blood and limbs flying in this game, so definately not for the young.

The controls are good and it is fairly easy to perform the combos, though many times you will find yourself just hitting the main attack buttons. As for enemy variety, there are many types and the mini-boss encounters are tough, mainly because sometimes the fights aren't fair as you have to leap on their backs at the right time and hope you don't leap into their hands.

When you come to save points or checkpoints, the game sometimes acts like it is freezing which can be disorienting, but it doesn't really detract from the game. As far as other glitches, there are some typical collision detection ones.

Overall, if you want to play a third person action game that is solid and based on a beloved character, this is the one to try, hands down.

4/5 stars

Pros:
*15+ hrs. of gameplay.
*Nice selection of attacks and great animations for each.
*Compelling story, expanding the movie, making you want to keep playing level after level.
*Controls are solid and intuitive
*Enemy AI is good.
*Sound and music are good.

Cons:
*Levels can become redundant. It's a tradeoff between length of game and repeating exploration of some of the same areas.
*The main bosses are either really easy or really hard. There is no consistency.
*Not much replayability, except for some bonus training levels.
*The last section seems rushed compared to the flow of the rest of the game."

29108,4,"Let me just start off by saying that Prisoners of Maw is hard as h**l. And I couldn't be happier! I remember wizzing through the original Rogue Squadron and then after finishing it saying ""Thats it?"" It was way too easy/short. If it had been longer, harder, or both it would have been much better.
But enough of that, this isn't a Rouge Squadron review, its a Rouge Squadron 2 review! And Rouge Leader is exactly what i wish the old game had been. the controll play is excellent, its MUCH harder than the old one, the graphics are stunning, and its a much better developed plot, the original seemed to go nowhere fast, with each level having almost nothing to do with the prevoius one.
In short, great game for a fantastic system, buy it, you'll be glad you did."
369249,4,"TO start off i was a big fan of shadow  warrior as a id, i got it from a friend at school and would sneak up late at night to play it because my mother didn't care much for violent video games. So when i found out it was being rebooted i was excited, turns out this its a remaster of the reboot for PC that came out in 2013, but one thing this game has for it is improved graphics. The original voice cast is back from what i can tell. Lo Wang still has his quips and one liners. The story is interesting and the katana fighting is interesting,  Now, upon saying that i do have a few issues with the game. The controls feel a little too responsive the enemies are repetitive and this game doesnt feel like it has the charm of the original, perhaps that is a personal nit pick about this game. Honestly, the game, when first released, released for 40$, got mediocre reviews and now you can find it for about 20$, which is when i picked it up, Honestly for a 20$ game, i am very pleased, but do not think it was worth what the original price point was.  the game plays as you would expect normal FPS  with melee elements, also, you get magic, little combos you can pull off to restor health/extra damage. Overall the story is about 5 hours, though an engrossing 5 hours, feels short. But its nowhere near Duke Nukem Forever."
137569,4,"I want to start off by saying that this game has a great premise. Becoming a master spy and saving the world might sound trite, but being James Bond never sounded like a bad thing to me. That, right there, is essentially the story of Alpha Protocol. However, I'd be doing the game a disservice if I stopped there. Its got interesting characters, a mostly believable plot, and a fantastic dialogue system. The combat and AI are pretty sketch sometimes, but that doesn't mar the experience. In summation, Alpha Protocol is a good game. Simple as that, really. If you enjoy espionage and intrigue and your actions having impact, I'd suggest you try this one."

173079,4,"4.2 stars

Not sure what the reviewers here who hate the graphics are looking for; I found this very visually compelling. This is a video game, after all, so I think the graphic novel feel fits well. I enjoyed playing it for the most part, though I wouldn't have minded a little more versatility in where I could go on the map. The puzzle elements are a good touch, and add another dimension to the search and destroy action.

Some really huge and loud monsters shake the floor via the subwoofer quite effectively; this one's a lease-breaker for apartment dwellers. The story is interesting enough; the whole Four Horsemen thing works perfectly in this context, and War is impressive enough. Throwing buses etc is a nice touch as well. We sure are getting a lot of apocalyptic games, movies, books lately...looks like the collective unconscious is tuning into how badly we've messed up this very real, non-video game planet we're on.

All told, Darksiders is perfect for when you want a dark, Conan-goes-megamythic kind of feel, and lots of floor-shaking car-tossing action."
25625,4,"This is a pretty fun game. It was the playstation standard, y'know? I really wish I could love this game. I really WANTEd to love this game. But I want something more. I've been playing Sly Cooper and Ratchet & Clank and have been spoiled. Those games push the envelope!
The vehicles are cool, though."

22259,4,"For those who played the original Mario 2 (like me), this will sort of be like a flash back to the past.  There a little graphical improvements, the sound is better, but in general, there's nothing really different about the game except now you can play it wherever you go.  The most annoying feature, is the characters' voices.  They just won't shut up.  This can me easily ignored...with lots of self control, but it slightly takes away the fun of the game.  I personally like the game Mario 2 and I think packaging it with the original Mario game is good thing, or else this game wouldn't be worth it for the people who played this game before.  For those who haven't played this game yet, you'll surely not regret having it.  It's fun, and it requires more strategy than the other mario games because it's different than all the other ones.  You can't kill enemies by stomping on them, you'll have to do more than that.  I'm personally waiting for remakes of Super Mario World and Super Mario 3.  Those games I think are the best Mario games."

Now with all the newer GH's, the notes are just not the same. It's funny some reviewer's said it's ""so easy,"" because to me it's just the right amount of challenge.

229047,4,"I've been doing Excerbeat for about 3months now and along with a MMA workout DVD I got, cause I like to mix it up, I'm looooving my workouts. I love Excerbeat for it's variety in martial arts/cardio boxing/stretching excersises. Plus, keep working at ea excersise, get the points and the more points/calories burned, it opens up to more excersises you'll like. Eventually you can customize your own workout routine...I could do that now, but I want to complete all of the excersises first, get GOLD on all of them and then make my custom work out. This game is great. Plus, love that you get to use Two Wii remotes, frees things up. IF Only Punch Out! could do that. Wow, would be great.

Only gripe, is for me apt, my room is limited, so doesnt read every movement I make, so I have to do a workout sometimes, more than once to get completed and get gold. Also too, you'd think the kids excerises would be easy and read movement...WOW, that's wrong. they are heavy workouts, especially for a kid.

but all in all- Exerbeat is a great fitness Game and great way to make you excersise, but enjoy doing it and customize it to fit what you like."
120266,4,"Before I begin, let me say: Borderlands is a blast. The atmosphere is awesome, the cell-shaded graphics are nicely distinctive, if you're not squeamish, plenty of gore.

That said, the game falls a bit short in some areas. The missions/quests are dull and repetitive. There's virtually no choices to make, no puzzles to solve or bypass. It's not the hybrid of RPG and FPS that we were promised. It's more like an FPS with experience points and a few minor stats to increase. 85% shooter, 15% RPG.

Yet, it's bizarrely addictive. It's got plenty of dark humor, which is often missing from other RPGs.

There's a lot of worthy reasons to recommend Borderlands - fun, fast, furious combat with unique graphics and loads of style. Just don't expect an RPG on par with Fallout 3."

37045,4,"When I first started this game (on an adequate computer), I was blown away! Sound and graphics are great, but they require a very powerful machine. I got a P4, 3GHz, 1GB ram, Radeon 9700 graphics card, and the performance is just OK. I installed it on an older rig (year and a half old), and it was not playable at all.
If you have good hardware however, this game is beautiful. The city is full of life, and there are a great number of different things happening. Many different buildings and styles. Awesome!
Once you get past that, you are in for a few frustrating hours. I do not care what other people say. This game is very hard! Mainly because of the lack of instructions. The tutorial is very short, and the manual is very thin. I have the strategy guide, but it doesn't explain many of the basic mechanisms. Well, it shouldn't. That's what the manual should be for. But unfortunately, there are many unanswered questions at first. For instance, there are no instructions on how to set up the water supply. Should I use water towers, or a pipe system instead? How many water pumps do I need? And where does the water come from in the first place? You can figure this out on your own, but since the economic model is very tight, you can not afford to build more than you need, or you'll fail terribly.
After a whole lot of trial and error however, things get clearer, and then the game isn't all that hard after all. This makes the lack of a good manual even worse!
I like that Sim City 4 introduces regions. This way, you can create a large metropolis, which is a combination of a number of interacting cities. Unfortunately, the implementation of this idea is sub-optimal as well. The problem is that each city still exists in it's own universe. When you switch from one city to the next, all but the active one just go to sleep. This means that no matter what you do in the other cities, nothing happens in the others. Example: Build a power plant and a power line to another city. Then, sell all the power to the other city. This will make you a lot of money. Then, just before you switch to the other city, turn off the selling operation. This means that although you collected money from that other city (and the money showed up in your account), the other city didn't actually have to pay at all, since nothing changed since you left and by the time you go back you turned off the power transfer. This means that the overall game doesn't have a consistant economy model, which is very disappointing especially in this game.
Oh, and talking about powerlines that are built across cities. Whenever you build something in one city that influences another, that other city will update its terrain the next time you go there. This makes sense to me, but should a simple powerline change the landscape of the other city and therefore wipe out buildings? Seems to me that only one building should be moved out of the way to make room for the power line...
There is one issue that truely [stinks]: Save games. You can not specify the name of a save game. Sim City will figure that out for you. Unfortunately, this means that there is only one save game per city. No going back to previous ones! So be very careful with those saves (and of course, you can not switch to another city in the region without saving or losing your information).
Another point of criticism is the lack of scenarios or even a campaign. There are several different areas you can play, and that's about it. No goals. Just kinda playing away. While this is a cool mode to have, it is also boring and I really crave some more defined goals. How about solving the traffic problem in L.A.? How about getting Salt Lake City ready for the Olympics? How about keeping New York operational after global warming melts away ice caps on the poles, and half the city is about to sink into the Atlantic? How about turning around the economy of Silicon Valley?
The could go as realistic or crazy as they wanted, but just give me some kind of goal!
And: You always start from scratch. It will take you a very long time to build a city with anything beyond a 4 or 5 story building, let alone sky scrapers, towers, and stadiums. I find that very frustrating.
Beyond that, it is a pretty cool game. Not the great game we were all expecting, but pretty good."
7630,4,"Almost a year after the Nintendo 64 made its debut to the world, Nintendo started to gain steam in rolling out new games. Starfox 64 was released in 1997 and was the sequel to the popular SNES game, Starfox. One of the first games to tote the much liked Rumble Pack support, it was an instant hit and sold millions of copies. It was and still is a great game to play to this day.

You control Fox McCloud, leader of his flight squad which includes 3 other characters (many of you know already who they are.) All of you are out to stop Andross (the main villain from the first game) from taking over the world again so you travel across different planets, each with its own theme and challenges. Shoot everything in sight to get points, fly through colored hoops (to refill your energy, extend your energy meter & restock weapons), collect bombs that destroy everything on the screen and defeat the boss in each planet to move on until you face off against Andross himself. Grab up to 3 friends and play the multi player modes to shoot it out against each other with its own options to tweak before each match starts.

The PROS: Nintendo did a great job when it came to making Starfox 64. From the intro to the digitized voices of the main characters to the story and overall presentation, you feel like you are Fox sitting in the cockpit and shooting at all the enemies. The graphics are sharp for a game in 1997 while the music is catchy and moody so it's great to hear it during your gaming experience. The sound effects are on point and the digitized voices are exactly how you expect all the characters to sound like. Starfox 64's controls are perfect; every button is used and it won't take long to get used to how it works. As an added treat, plug in your Rumble Pack and you get force feedback for just about anything you do and when you take enemy fire (or run into objects.) Playing through it won't take you long but if you meet certain conditions, you can take alternate paths and visit other planets and face against alternate/different bosses altogether, thereby extending the game.

The CONS: A few issues pop up that prevented me from giving it a 5 star rating but they are rather small and doesn't ruin the overall experience. The game won't save your progress until you beat Andross on his home planet and even at that, it only saves your overall score and how many lives you have. So if you have to quit the game, you'll have to start from the beginning all over again the next time you play. The game's difficulty spikes up on certain planets while it plummets on others so you may have to replay certain planets until you memorize it completely. The multi player modes aren't really anything special so you won't play this with your friends for long periods of time unlike other games like Goldeneye 007 or Perfect Dark.

Starfox 64 remains as one of the best games in the series and players come back to it and play through it again. It looks and plays great; lots of planets to play through and decent multi player modes make this game an excellent choice to pick up and play on the Nintendo 64. If you can't seem to find it or don't want to pay what people are asking for, you can download this title for the Wii on the Virtual Console service for $10 (1,000 points.) I highly recommend it so if you haven't played it yet, there is no reason for you to not try it out."
407223,4,"Sure it's not perfect, but it's worth every cent if you have many friends to join you in your crusade. If you're going solo, you're going to have a bad time enjoying the game as much."
462024,4,The best ever cowboy console game.

3016,4,"Riven is a worthy followup to Myst and still must rate as one of the alltime great adventure games.
Those familiar with the Myst series will know some of what to expect: lush visuals (although in static form, no 360 rendering), a detailed storyline, fiendishly clever puzzles, much mysterious machinery, and a need to respond to and interact with the environment in order to solve the game.
There are some important differences to the Myst series.  First of all, rather than exploring a number of different worlds, or 'ages', in Riven you explore one (albeit large) world, comprised of five islands.  There are links to two other 'ages' but these are very sketchily developed and there is not much to explore here.  There are some differences between the islands, but the radically different tones of the ages in Myst or Myst III is missing.
This has its advantages and disadvantages.  The world you explore is much larger, and you can progress over virtually the whole world without needing to solve many puzzles, allowing even a casual player a good glimpse at the world of Riven.
However, it also means that the puzzles are less contained and linear than in the other Myst games.  As well as a number of smaller puzzles, there are two major puzzles to be solved, clues for which are scattered throughout the islands.  Even with the smaller puzzles, the control to open a vital door might be located a long distance away, or only accessible via a very circuitous route.  This can add another degree of complexity to the puzzles.  Having said that, there is a degree of logic to most of the controls which are based on the culture and lifestyle of the inhabitants of Riven.  The puzzles generally also operate in a logical manner and relate well to the entire environment of the game.
There is little action for the punch-em-up enthusiasts - but they're unlikely to be reading the review anyway.
In summary, a fantastic game that will engross you for hours - I just wish more alternative ages could have been included."
3492,4,"I personally own this game and can testify to how good it is. WWF attitude has eccellent character selection, and create a player mode....for its time. Unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like Smackdwon 2 with its quick executing of moves, unlike Attitude, and its enormous backstage area, unlike attitude. But on the good side it has some things other games don't, tag team Gauntlet and its huge hidden character selection that you are always trying to unlock. Great game, i would reccommend it to anyone who likes slowerpace games."
88302,4,"Ok, so if you are any kind of an RPG fan you've played Final Fantasy at some point.  And up until now, you had no options on the DS unless you picked up the ones for the Game Boy Advance.

Square Enix decided to bring FFIII (you may know this from the SNES but that is called FFVI here in the US), which was never released on any system previously, as the first DS entry.  So how does it fair?  Let's take a look:

Presentation:  8/10
The game is fairly straightforward but can get downright frustrating at times (forget to talk to 1 person, your forward progress will be stopped in its tracks).  The menus are user friendly and the additional perks you can use through multiple DS's via the mail system definitely helps this game's cause.

Graphics:  8/10
Make no mistake, this game looks great on the DS, probably one of the best ones.  The cinema's are quite amazing for a small system.  Lots of detail in the towns and dungeons.  Especially creepy (at first) is when you cross into the dark world with your airship the first time.  Square (as with most FF's) has done a great job with the look of the game.

Sound:  8.5/10
Not as great a score as came with, say, FFVII, but when I have tunes from the game stuck in my head it means either I played it too much or they were really good.  Keep in mind the DS speakers don't do any sound justice so if you have a great pair of headphones that will definitely help the experience out.

Gameplay:  9.5/10
Now this is where this game kicks some serious butt.  The Job system in FFIII is awesome.  Want 4 black mages?  You got it.  4 warriors?  Ditto.  You get the selection of the original FF but the ability to have several different jobs leveled up on the 4 main characters.  This adds pretty much an endless amount of ways to complete the main quest.

Now, why doesn't this get a 10 out of 10?  Well let's put it this way:  If you are used to be coddled in other FF's (FF II for the SNES comes to mind) you are going to be in for a shock in this one. Go off on your own early on (even later on) and prepare for a quick Game Over.  I saw more game overs in the first 2 hours I played this FF as I did in all of FFVII and FFIX put together.  To put it mildly:  You better level up or get smoked.  Often.

Replay Value:  6/10 (9/10 if your friends have game/DS)
Hardcore FF's and RPG'ers will want to try many different job combinations and Low Level games to see how many different ways you can win.  But for most 1 time through will be enough.  The mail system will allow you to open weapons, spells, etc. that are not available to a single player/game and offers a better incentive then most games like this.

Overall:  8.5/10
This is definitely one of the best RPG's you have for the DS.  Rumor has it that they are doing at FFVI remake (FFIII for you SNES types) that will be on the DS.  If that is the case you might just see that become the best one as it is rumored to have extras on it not available with the GBA or the SNES.

If you are FF fan, this is a must play.  If you are an RPG fan, check it out.  But be prepared to be taken to school if you think you are going to just rush through this one.  Old school to be sure!"
117319,4,This thing works wonderful.  The only thing I do not like is the fact that you have to plug it into your computer to charge them up.  The batteries last a long while.

164896,4,"Hopefully, this will be the last of the Legend of Spyro series, because the whole concept of the series is wrong. This game is cooler than Eternal Night and New Beginning, because for the first time, another dragon is playable along with Spyro, Cynder. They both have thier own unique powers, and you can switch between them at anytime. Also, they can both fly at any time, which is very helpful in some places. Other than all that, the storyline to this game is rather dark, and it feels more like Lord of the Rings rather than Spyro. I guess maybe thats what the developers were going for...but either way the concept doesnt work. Spyro games need to be fun, entertaining, and clever. Not difficult, dark, and all around rediculous. I only own this game for sentimental reasons. Other than that, its an abomination to the Spyro name. If you like difficult games, this ones for you. If you prefer the way Spyro used to be in the good old days, don't bother with this one it may only upset you."
173307,4,"One of my favorite controllers of all time. Has a great feel for holding as well as the button pressing. However, the controllers are known among many to have certain buttons stop working or become more difficult to press. Though if taken care of, this shouldn't be an issue, and even if this is the case, taking one apart and cleaning it can fix the broken button. If you can get a perfect one, these controllers are great."
172403,4,Works very well after a bit of calibration
173489,4,This was purchased as a gift.  The receiver enjoyed the game.  It performed as it should.  It arrived on time and as described.
325705,4,"While there are some technical aspects of the game that bothered us a lot, the overall feel of it was really entertaining and left us laughing and feeling silly (in a good way).

Here are the downsides:
-only one controller evaluates your movement, so technically, only your left or right hand have anything to do with the score, and your legs, torso, and other arm are technically irrelevant
-the stick figures that show the choreo are sort of different than what the person in front is doing, so it's a little confusing
-the rules and scoring are a little vague and hard to figure out

Having said that, you have so much fun looking ridiculous, the rest doesn't even matter. The ""music videos"" range from cute to incredibly goofy, and as an adult, I was laughing out loud for the disco one with the guy in a unitard and...well...what else can I call it but a porn mustache? There was also one with lasers shooting out of the girls' hands. Pretty awesome stuff, all in all. Lots of laughs guaranteed with this game!"
160823,4,"I can't possibly explain why this game is getting such mixed reviews, it is one of the best I've played in years.  A perfect balance between Socom-type stealth/weaponry and very creative espionage missions.  The computer hacking/lock picking/alarm deactivating in this game were very well thought out and very rewarding when done properly.  The variety of weapons is amazing, and each one has advantages and disadvantages depending on the mission type.  There are some levels that you can run and gun your way through, but some where you will be killed in seconds if you try that approach.

Your decisions during conversations impact the game play more than on just a superficial level, and the decisions are never obvious as in games like Fallout III.  Overall, I believe any gamer should give this one a rental.  If you're not caught up within ten minutes you may never be, so it's a quick assessment.  I was swept away after the first mission.  The only reason I didn't award five stars was due to some AI stupidity (I played on normal though, not difficult).  Some enemy soldiers are very intelligent and some are mindless zombies, it's nice to keep you on your toes but the stupid ones sometimes run right passed you and not see you standing there.  I imagine on the difficult setting this wouldn't happen.  But it really evens out b/c the intelligent guards will sometimes shoot at you and sometimes bum rush you and beat the heck out of you.

Overall, great game and definitely a huge step forward in espionage gaming."
75083,4,Ok
40427,4,"Nightmare in Dream Land's story is simple: King DeDeDe has stolen the Rod of Dreams, which in turn takes away the people of Dream Land's dreams. It is up to Kirby to get it back and restore everyones dreams.

The gameplay is real basic, and to be honest, real fun. You run around the levels as Kirby who has the power to jump, inhale air and basically fly for a little bit, swim, and swallow hisenemies for thier abilities. There are roughly 30 moves, some exclusive to this NES remake, including shooting lasers, throwing large blade-boomerangs, turning into a tornadoe, or surrounding yourself with ice.

If you find certain secrets within the stages, you can unlock mini-games and an ""ability gallery"" which was cool. Some mini-games include grinding on a pipe and having to press ""A"" to jump over spiked portions of the railing while racing other colored Kirbys, or having to face-off with a handful of enemies by pressing ""A"" faster then they can so you can beat them up. There are more but I just don't feel like getting into it. As for the gallery, it's pretty sweet - you enter this room and usually there are 2 different abilities waiting for you to take them. Sadly, this game didn't borrow from the SNES smash hit ""Kirby Super Stars"" or even the N64 title ""Kirby Crystal Shards"" with the idea of combining abilities, but we can look past it for now.

The graphics are definitley an upgrade from the original NES title, and are very colorful and nice. The enemies style look unique and interesting, the abilities still look devastating, and levels are really nice looking for a GBA game. It sort of has a cartoon feel now that I think about it..

The music is great and really catchy. I can't really explain it - imagine it as sort of a techno beat, but much more...hmm..less serious and more experimental. The SFX are great as well - I love the sound of the bombs exploding or the firey sound.. superb. There isn't any talking in this game, but after witnessing the cartoon series and the N64 game of Kirby, I'm grateful for that.

Nightmare in Dream Land isn't really too hard of a game, and it isn't really a long game either. Sure there are maybe 7 different worlds with about 8 different stages within the worlds, but they fly by pretty quick and easily. What is kind of annoying is that sometimes the controls will be unresponsive - you'll be running forward, then wanna quickly turn around to attack an approaching enemy, but Kirby is still running forward and BAM you get hit. I'm not going to type out the ending, but lets just say it was sorta dissapointing.

To finish it up, I highly suggest you atleast play this game. Yes, it gets repetitive, but with it's basic side-scrolling gameplay, nice graphics, interesting levels, and wide array of abilities & mini-games, how could you truley get bored? Better yet, its a remake of an old NES game, and a good one at that. Go and play Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland if you haven't already."
371287,4,"I grew up playing DOOM and DOOM II on my Playstation. The aspects of the game were very simple, yet addicting. It was like a violent, demon-filled maze and that's what led to countless hours of fun. This game does a great job in bringing that element back with a more modern style. I especially love that each level has a hidden room that pays tribute to the original DOOM games. Such a nice touch.

If you loved the original DOOM games and you enjoy today's FPS games you will most certainly enjoy this game.

Also, I have to add that the soundtrack is simply amazing! It gave me goosebumps during intense moments. Just don't play it in the car or you WILL speed and ram other cars out of the way. XD"
406395,4,I'm an old fan of all of the Ratchet and Clank games. I own all of them on PS2 and PS3. This is a reboot of the original and that's alright with me. The visuals are amazing and I love that I can change the look of the game from the color tones to the shape of the bolts being collected. It could have been a lot longer like some of the other games but the gorgeous visuals made it worth it.
241256,4,"I really liked Crysis 1 and 2.  They are fun games.  This one just didn't seem to grab me like the others.  I guess because it was more of the same and did not change all that significantly.  If you have not played any of them, then I would say you will enjoy it.  But if you have played the series from the start you will feel like it is more of the same.

In my humble opinion."
110333,4,"I bought this game for my 10yr old newphew as a Christmas presents and he can't stop playing it.  I mean he literally plays it all night.  I personally am not into Dragon Ball Z, but if he likes it, so do I."
101318,4,"Face it- a lot of games made for kids, especially on the DS, are embarrassing. When my daughter turned 2 last year, she started to show a lot of interest in the DS, and one of the games I was looking into getting for her was Disney Friends here. It got solid reviews, and the one thing that stood out to me was that it seemed to be made with fun for kids in mind, and wasn't just a 'hey, this is stupidly easy to play. Let's ship it out!' release. Needless to say, I was impressed after playing around in the game a bit myself, and then seeing my daughter play the games after seeing how I did them. Now she's almost 3, and is almost completely able to play it on her own. Yes, there's text, but if you show your child how it's done, and they pay attention, there's nothing here that's too complicated.

You start out by playing with the Alien from Toy Story. This gets you into the basics of gameplay and interaction with your friend. As you progress and make your friend happy, you'll get another, and eventually you'll have the 4: Simba, Stitch, Dory and Pooh. The Alien'll always be around as a tutorial buddy, but he doesn't quite count as a real interactive friend on here when you compare him to the others. You can give your friend accessories to wear, put toys in their rooms, play games with them and more. The coolest part is that they really act like they did in the movies, and respond to your actions as they should. These aren't just rushed character models with a few voice samples, though the voice samples are still fairly limited. So it's good to see that the developer took their time making things right in that department. And you gotta love hearing Stitch play with cars and cardboard buildings after you set them up, and he starts stomping through things, roaring like a monster.

Some of the games you can play include making music, coloring, guessing where an object is, and much more. Again, nothing's too hard for a child to understand once they see how to do it, but older ones that can read, or are learning to, will get more out of it. There's no real object to the game once you get all the friends, but whenever you start it up, you need to try and fill up the happiness meter for each friend, via playing with them, feeding them, etc. You earn money that can be used to buy more accessories and food. If you want Stitch to have rockin' sunglasses, buy some. If you want Simba to have a rainbow afro wig, go for it!

Essentially, this is the kind of game Nintendogs should've been- something with variety that proves its worth for your dollar. To me, the only things that could've made the game a 5 star game would be more spoken lines for the characters and maybe a few more accessories. But when it comes down to it, this is one of the better games for children on the DS. Disney Friends doesn't treat the player like an idiot and should keep one's attention for a good amount of time because of all there is to do with each character. But you should still check the game out for yourself before handing it to your child, or at least sit there with them and make sure they get how to do things before getting frustrated and giving up on it altogether. Give it a shot- it's a hundred times more entertaining than those other virtual pet simulators."
172073,4,"I've not experienced the original Pikmin game on the GCN, but this one feels fairly awesome.  After having played the game I was left wanting more, but wasn't quite sure exactly what that was.  I feel as though a bit more could be added in the way of environmental variety (which I'm sure was addressed in the sequel and will be addressed in the third entry) this game is seriously solid.  The controls work (and make perfect sense with the pointing mechanics) the graphics are serviceable and the feeling of cohesion with the player's Pikmin is captured in an impressive fashion, I've never cared more about my ""drones"" so much as with this game.  I can't NOT recommend this to those who haven't played it, as this game receives little recognition outside of the gaming community and it is just pure, unadulterated fun.

8/10"
35262,4,"This game is an awsome game. First of all the new mini camp mode is awsome especially for you new madden players out there because you can learn the basics for anything(running,passing,run defense,pass defense,pass rushing,etc). The graphics are also amazing. Now i am a big football fan and also played on a team so i know a good game. The Refs never throw the flag the refs barely call pass interferance unless you turn the penalty meter all the way up. This is still not a big flaw and didn't turn me away from the game. The major flaw is the memory it takes which is 59 blocks your whole memory card unless you have a huge one. So all summed up it is a good game with great graphics but takes a lot of memory."
70990,4,"Are you crazy?  This is not like playing the movie.  It is way fun.  But it is not like playing the movie.  THe garphics on the XBOX 360 are incredible.  It is incredibly realistic.  But you can certainly tell this is a video game and not film.  I think the previous reviewer was a little excited.  Anyway.  The game is fun.  There are plenty of things to do.  THe Kong levels are way fun, but do not think they are half or more of thge game.  They are only about 20 percent of the game.  Too Bad because they are way fun.  The human levels are great too though.  This game is from the creators of Beyond Good and Evil and it shows.  Both games are great.

Bottom Line:  If you love the movie get the game.  If you want a great first person shooter get perfect dark or call of duty."
449902,4,"The Game Gear isn't exactly my personal recommendation for a video game system, but it still has a decent library of games. It just doesn't have as much charming titles as its competitor, the Game Boy, offered. Sonic Drift 2, according to the average Sonic fans, is one of the rather questionable games that came out of the system. You play as Sonic and friends as they....race...through certain zones..in cars.

The game plays like Namco's arcade classic, Pole Position, but with Mario Kart-style elements, such as items. The items you get from the boxes either slow someone down, speed you up, or make you bounce.

The game features Quick Race mode, Multiplayer Vs, and Grand Prix (with 5 tracks per cup). The tracks may be based off of certain zones in the Genesis Sonic games, but it surely doesn't differ too much from one other. Sure the maps are different, and the theme is, too, but that's it. Mystic Cave Zone is an exception, as it contains a few tunnels. Those tunnels, however, are frustrating because you are pushed to the very edge of the screen.

Overall, it's Pole Position with a nice Sonic flavor, but also with a lack of variety."
155996,4,"Actually played Mass Effect 2 first, and liked it so much that I tried this one.  It would probably be better to go in sequence (if you have not played either yet).  Good story and some interesting decisions have to be made, which made it more than just an FPS.

However, planet exploration was cool for the first 12 seconds...then it becomes drive over there...and there...and there.  Some of the situations are entertaining and require thinking your way out of a problem rather than most games in this genre where you just have to solve endless ""jumping puzzles"" (see: Tomb Raider, Force Unleashed, etc.).

Having said that, Bioware makes a great story in my opinion, and this one does just that.  The characters are team mates and not just there to soak up damage.

Recommend!"
71021,4,"I'm becoming a little more critical of XBox 360 games lately, since most seem to lean towards multiplayer online platforms and I prefer single player games. Battlestations Midway marks the latest in the trend. That being said, this game is fun, (relatively) easy to get the hang of with excellent tutorials, beautiful graphics, and good replayability. However the single player campaign is relatively short-lived. The variety of controlling different ships, planes, and subs (and jumping back and forth between them) seems more confusing than it is. You can assign orders to a particular unit and the AI does a pretty good job on its own, leaving you free to focus elsewhere and not having to micromanage unless you want to. The interfaces are pretty easy, although I found flying to be more difficult than usual to do efficiently.

Much like Gears of War, Star Trek Legacy, and others, this game really shines in XBox Live online play. As a single player game, it's still fun to play the campaign, and the scenarios are a good time killer, but you may want to just rent it for a week and you can play it out."
112223,4,I actually bought Modern Warfare first but I think I like this one even better! It's a lot of fun to play and chat with buddies while playing online (I haven't tried the campaign yet though). I only wish that you could play with at least two people on one screen when playing online. As it is you can only have one person play online at a time- so that's why my brother and I have Halo ODST :). Though we both agree that Call of Duty 4 is more fun to play by yourself then Halo ODST is.
176010,4,"The Arcade Version is not meant for everyone. If you are a casual gamer and don't care much for media storage or online gaming, this console is perfect for you.

The Arcade version is capable of doing everything the Pro and Elite versions, but does not come with the components to do so. It's missing a hard drive, HD cables, network cable, and headset.

The only thing I needed from the missing components is the Hard Drive to download games. I already have an HDMI cable and network cable, which both cost me less than $10. I picked up a refurbished 20GB Hard Drive and wireless controller from circuit city for $40. If it isn't available anymore, go to the X-box website and get a refurbished 20GB hard drive and 3 month membership to xbox live gold for $30.

I have everything I need for a fraction of the price of a pro or elite model. I'm using the saved cash to buy games.

My Pros:
Great game selection
Supposedly no more RROD
Value
Online gaming with friends

My Cons:
Very Loud DVD Drive (without Hard Drive)
Doesn't look as nice (Arcade has basic White DVD-Tray vs Chrome on Pro and Elite models)

Other Notes: I also got a JASPER model. People are mentioning the way you can tell is by looking at the power block. It should read 150w with 12.0-12.1V."

Two of the games, ""House of 1000 Doors: Family Secrets"" and ""Weird Park - Broken Tune"" for example, have storylines that are so daft they can't help but be entertaining. Typical of Viva Media titles, the hidden object scenes are just gorgeous to look at and a delight to play.

The not so great - Others here have warned about installation problems, and unfortunately, I ran into the same thing.  When you insert the disc, you can pick the games you want to install, so as a test, I tried installing  ""House of 1000  Doors: Family Secrets"" and ""Weird Park - Broken Tune"" (one from each separate collection)  on three different computers - Two are older systems running Windows Vista, one is a pretty new machine running Windows 7.  On all three systems, the games took an extremely long time to load - there was a lot of disc chugging, and on my newest computer, I had to force a shutdown reboot and try a second install. Bottom line was with patience, yes, I was able to successfully load both ""test"" games on all 3 computers, but it shouldn't have been this dicey.  Had antivirus running on all machines, but I don't think this was the problem.

So, the game collections themselves = 5+ stars.  The install = buy and try one collection before you buy another."
28090,4,"Every body who owns a game console, chose their console for a reason. Usually there is a title that looks so enticing to the game player, that he/she will plunk down a large chunk of money for a system, just so they can play that one game.  Now, if you own a GameCube, Mario is a likely candidtate for this sort of influence, or pehaps the new Metroid games (one is for Game Boy Advance) that have me salivating now.  Well, Eternal Darkness had this effect on me.  I purchased this game because of the amazingly positive reviews I read.  I watched the trailers on the intenet, and it looked so awesome to me, that I had to get a GameCube.  Well I played Eternal Darkness (ED from here on out) and it is a really good game.  It is fun, and there are a lot of innovative features to it.  The sanity meter is genius.  This concept will undoubtedly be used again, although never to the same degree of surprise that this first game gave us.  By the way. Do yourself a favor and do not read what all of the insanity effects are before you play the game.  It will ruin them for you.  Why four stars then you ask?  Well.  For one, the game was too hyped.  It is not a genre beginning title (what is anymore.)  It is not survival horror like the Resident Evil GameCube remake is.  (RE is superb by the way)  The game was pitched in such a way that led be to believe it was scary.  It really wasn't for me.  Yes there are a lot of wonderful surprises with the sanity/insanity effects and all, however, it never acheives the level of creepiness that RE carries all the way through it.  It is really an adventure game.  I love the dynamic camera.  In RE, the camera angles are stills.  ED's camera angles are mobile and fully rendered in 3D!  The magick is great.  There are a few monotonous parts, but in the end the game is very satisfying.  This game is more of a 3D adventure than survival horror.  Yes is is bloody and greusome at times, yet these aspects alone do not define the survival horror genre.  Keep these things in mind, and you will no doubt love this game.  It really is fun and unique, just not the 5 stars I would have liked it to be."
386912,4,"The game gets a solid 7 from me, with the chance to grow with post-launch support, and the possibility that this could be an evergreen title that EA constantly adds to for a few years.  While none of that is for certain, it is definitely worth speculation due to the lack of a number in the title; where all other EA SPORTS titles have one.

First I'll start off with the bad.  It is lacking something new for being the first title of the current gen.  It's missing something to wow us like an online career mode or even online leagues.  It is also missing features that were great in the last iteration of Tiger such as Country Clubs.  The lack of a punch to start us off on the PS4/XB1 is what really kills the score.

The lack of courses I can go either way on.  I fully understand the fact that these courses were completely built from scratch with the Frostbite engine; which in the long run was a GREAT thing.  There are only 8 licensed courses to start, with the 9th coming for free in September.  Hopefully they have a DLC model that will make the long-time fans of this game happy.  Giving the first course free is a great start.

The last bit of negative is the fact that the player creation is very bare bones.  While there is room for this to be patched and be better, what we have right now is not great at all.  It would have been great to see them use the same tech that the NBA Live team is using for their face scans.

Now on to the good.  This game is BEAUTIFUL.  There is a fictitious, but realistic course new to the game called Lighthouse Pointe that is extremely beautiful to enjoy a round of golf on.  The graphics are phenomenal, and so is the atmosphere surrounding the golf course.  This is a notable step-up from the past.

The fictitious courses are we welcome addition to the game as they are beautifully designed.  I talked about Lighthouse Pointe previously, and there is also the Wetlands that is set up almost like your municipal course back home.  Then there are the fantasy courses such as Coyote Falls that is carved into the Grand Canyon, and Paracel Storm that is taken from Battlefield 4.  As far as fantasy courses go, these offer a lot of fun, and since Paracel Storm is 18 holes of all par 3's, you can work on getting those aces.

The gameplay is not completely different from the past, but amateur mode has a new wrinkle where the putt preview is gone and the putt read line is in its place.  This makes you actually have to execute a little better and the amateur mode is not a gimme in online play.  Offline play though there is a blue line that actually guides you and teaches you were the ball will land taking wind and elevation into effect.

The swing mechanic in the Tour mode is great as your swing has mechanics and feedback that are affected based on your back and down swing.  I have really enjoyed playing Tour mode a lot, but there is also a returning shot mechanic in the 3-click swing.  That is the old school way to play EA SPORTS golf, and it was a challenge jumping back into that swing mechanic.

Going back and forth between the three difficulties will add a lot of variety to the game, but also you can create a custom set of rules to mix a balance between Amateur and Tour.

Night Club Challenge is the new feature in the game where it's basically an arcade mode with a ton of challenges to try to complete.  I like this addition to the game as it teaches new users how to get started; while offering a great challenge to try to get three stars on each challenge.  I created a video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR8d7YJfUWE on how to 3-star the first 18 challenges.

Finally, while career mode is basically untouched, the career progression system is a great addition to the game for your created pro.  Based on your performance in the round, some of your attributes will automatically increase, and the game will show that to you at the end of each round, but you can also select ""personality types"" such as power, up and down, precise, and etc. to mold your golfer.  Each type will affect ratings for the good and the bad, and eventually you'll have four types you can select with about 24 to choose from.

Overall, Rory McIlroy PGA TOUR is a great base with a lot of room to grow.  There is a lot missing from the retail product today, but hopefully we will see some growth with this product in the months after."

247579,4,"This was one of those gifts that I took a chance on.

My son is very artistic and gifted in that sense. I didn't know if he'd appreciate a game tool like this for the PS3 but he took to it like a fish to water. He plays with this weekly and does some pretty creative things with it. Pairing it with the Super Hero Squad game that I bought separately was a good move on my part. It's a nice change of pace from the usually violently themed games that one normally finds for this system.

I'd recommend this to anyone with a child that enjoys being artistically creative to give them another medium to express the artistic ability within."

What FLOORS me the most is some of the prices on the items. The "" Batmobile "" looking roadster had a price tag of around 2 to 6 million Simoleons. SOOPER Wolfie my Werewolf super hero couldn't afford that if he had HALF of sunset valley as live-in room-mates.

I really do want to SHARE ALL MY SIMS, etc. If you like or love the Sims3 I would recommend this as something in the way of adding the tidbit of morsels that which EACH expansion pack has to offer.

146351,4,"THE GOOD:

Great graphics, the gameplay has been HUGELY improved from the original, and the story is interesting. It definitely feels more supernatural than the first one, because they hit you with the mental stuff right off the bat. So right away, this game feels like the awesome, hallucinaton-filled second half of the first game. That's a very good sign.  It goes back to ""reality"" a few chapters in, and the hallucinations/supernatural elements become less common, but it's still fun.

The combat is fun - some people say it's become too easy to beat down on the thugs, and so it takes away from the suspense...but it's fine with me, because 1.) It's not THAT easy to beat up the thugs, you're still on your toes, plus they often attack in packs, and 2.) Story-wise, it makes sense. Ethan's been through so much, he *should* have learned to fight better since the original. So instead of feeling cheap when you're doing a Chain attack on someone, you feel awesome and powerful.

The investigation segments...gah, they're so much better it's ridiculous. Instead of just finding the victim's wound and taking a picture, you have to decide whether they were stabbed or shot; whether it's an entry wound or exit wound, etc. It's awesome.

Now, for...

THE BAD:

The environments you explore are reminiscent of the first game - run-down, deserted buildings.  You spend more time outside in the city, which I don't particularly like...at least in the first game, you could pretend that the outside world is ""normal"", that you're really exploring a deserted department store in a real city.  In this game, you're often outside, and the city is ridiculously deserted and the sky is green.  Stupid.

It has more cutscenes...more cutscenes that either try to show how ""cool"" Ethan is, or cutscenes that make you think ""What the hell just happened?"" For example....*MINOR SPOILERS*....I found a body, took some pictures, thinking how fun that was. I had been with two cops, and we got separated, so I had to tell them the number of the room I was in. And then suddenly a cutscene started which showed those two cops running with the body on a bridge, with Ethan running after them at the head of a gang of thugs. One of the cops turned and shot some electrical box that made a line of fire block the bridge, so Ethan and the thugs had to stop. It wasn't until the ""good"" cop cried ""Ethan's still back there!"" that I realized Ethan was NOT suddenly aligned with the thugs. It was just a stupid-looking cutscene, and something you'd never find in the first game.

Anyways, the constant moves from gameplay to action-packed cutscene are jarring and pretty much kills any of the lonely, mysterious atmosphere the first game had.

Another thing I just don't like is the ""upgrade"" system. If you find things throughout the level (like the dead birds from the first game), you get Mission Points. Do good enough on a Mission (chapter), and you get an Upgrade. Stuff like bullet-proof vests, silver knuckles, etc. It sounds cool...but I kind of like the idea of surviving with whatever you can find in the environment, and getting upgrades that, well, make sense with the game world. It's ridiculous to jump off a roof in Chapter 2, and land in the factory in Chapter 3 with a brand-new bulletproof vest. It feels like it came straight out of a videogame from 1995.

So...overall I think it's still a good game, and I think it's worth $30, but not $60.  It seems to have the ""Prince of Persia 2"" syndrome. It's like the marketing people didn't like the sales of the first game, so they made Monolith put in ""more action"" and stuff like that.  Although at $30, it's kind of tough to go wrong when you know what you're getting into."
408355,4,"I had a lot of fun with this game and then decided I wasn't going to be the select few that kept playing. The issue is, if you pick this game up late, the only people still playing might be really serious. I would give it a go though"

149393,4,"Wow! The graphics on God of War 3 are truly mind blowing.  The God of War Games in the PS2 console have always pushed the limits of what the system is capable of. God of War 3 takes full advantage of PS3's capabilities, and then some!

The game begins right where its predecessor left off: Kratos scaling mount Olympus in order to settle the score with Zeus and co. From there, the plot takes off in directions that are familiar to fans of the series.

Some gamers have told me that this game was easy compared to the rest. I think that's true, but not because of the game's creators. I think it's because at this point, those of us who are familiar with the games mechanics pretty much know what to do.

The graphics in this game are above anything you've ever seen before, and playing it is an experience not to be missed.

The only complaint I have about this game is the same one I had with its predecessor:  some of  the battles seem to go on forever. Without giving too much away, the game's final boss battle had me wondering (several times), ""How many times do I have to kill this guy?""

 The third and fourth act of the final battle just seemed there because the creators wanted the game to be longer. They don't add anything to the overall experience."
378580,4,"As an Xbox 360 and PS3 owner with a large number of unplayed games on those platforms, it took the release of the Halo Master Chief Collection to convince me to get the Xbox One. I was able to get it at an extreme discount by combining signup bonuses from  the Amazon Store Card and Amazon Rewards card with the 5% discount with the Chase Freedom Card and free shipping from Amazon Prime. It actually cost less than the Black Friday Xbox One without connect deal!

*Setup*
It was very each to connect, being straight forward to plug in the power cable, hdmi cable, network cable, insert batteries into the controller, and turn on.  The setup wizard walked me though initial choices, and Google help out with the audio/video settings :)

Kinect voice control took some time to learn as I didn't read up on them, the connect set wizard got me started, but definitely could have been more detailed. It did recognize my face and my voice right away, but I did get stuck on the fact that the commands to turn it on and off are not symmetric ( i.e. ""Xbox On"" vs ""Xbox Turn Off<pause> , yes"" .

Kinect gesture control was another thing altogether. I could get it to recognize most of the basic gestures, but it often did not acknowledge them at all. Or it would place my hand on the screen in a position far on the edge of the screen, even though I was sitting in the center of the screen and had the kinect 'eye' right on front of me. Sometimes my right hand would appear on the left hand of the screen and vice versa.  Also, despite several resets, it will not acknowledge 2 hands being raised at the same time, which is necessary for the ""go home"" and ""resume from home"" gestures.

That said, once i had the basics down, I could not imagine using the Xbox without it. I don't understand why so many people discounted it because of the lack of games that use it. The kinect is valuable as part of the user interface to the Xbox One and is worth having just for that reason. If games use it as well, I view that as icing on the cake.

*Gaming and Apps*
I purchased several games from the Microsoft Store and it took the better part of the day to download them enough to play them. I don't know if it was because I purchased fairly new  titles that were in demand or had large patched associated with them, or what. Master Chief Collection took about 4 hours, and then it needed a 20GB patch when I ran it for the 1st time.

Once I got started playing, things went fairly well. The graphics were great, the wireless controller was responsive, the games were snappy, and the surround sound audio was also top knotch.

So why ""fairly well?"" When I started my first game, the console started making a loud noise that sounded like a fan with a bad bearing. It was so loud that I had to plug in my MS gaming headphones to the controllers ( another great feature ) to enjoy the game. After doing some research, I discovered that this was a common issue with some type of electrical coil that would void my warranty if I fixed it myself, so I had to mail my Xbox out for warranty repair.

Apps worked well, I use Plex and Amazon Video without problems. They were very easy to install and set up, so I have no complaints.

*Summary*
Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, especially with the discount that I got. The voice control , the wireless audio, and well designed interface were all big pluses. I'm disappointed that it had the noise problem out of the box that kept me from using for long, and more disappointed that I could not drop it off at a Microsoft Store for an immediate replacement or repair. Microsoft could learn something about customer service from Apple here. I was about to purchase Dragon Age Inquisition along with other games during Black Friday, but held off since I won't get my Xbox back for who knows how long.

The games that game with the console weren't a big factor for me, in fact I've download but not started playing Assassin's Creed yet. I'll get to after I get my Xbox is repaired.

Recommendation: Buy if you can get a good discount on it. I think the price with Kinect should be $350, and without connect $300, but that's just me. Be ready prepared for slow downloads of games and to spend time training kinect. Also  fire up a game early on to see if your console has the ""noisy coil"" bug. That is something that you want to get fixed right away."

307556,4,"Although the graphics are very good they missed out on a lot of game dynamics. One example of this is that nearly all of the game modes require internet. The game relies on its network modes far too heavily. Game play is fairly smooth and there isn't many noticeable defects. However, one major defect they failed to acknowledge is the screen play. In online mode, other players rely heavily on this play because it is nearly impossible to stop. It is not rare where a opponent will run a screen play as many as three times in a row. Although there is some problems with the game, the overall feel of the game is good. I expect next years Madden will be very clean and have few defects."

57522,4,"Okay here is the deal when it comes to Rapala's fishing game.

First it really is kind of fun to play, it has somewhat realistic play and a very large variety of fishing locations and fish.  I really have only one complaint, that is two player.  It would be really nice to have a competition with someone who isn't a computer.  But I will list for you the pros and cons that I have found.

PROS:

1.  Wide variety of fish, locations and lures makes for exciting fishing.  Let's face it most of us are not going to get the chance to go to Alaska for some good Salmon fishing, but with this game you can.

2.  Very easy to play.  If you don't have great hand-eye coordination (fine tuned by years of playing video games) this game has options that makes it easier.  With an auto-cast function you can simply point and shoot.  But the game also has a manual cast for longer and more accurate casting.

3.  Underwater or top water lure cam.  With the option of either watching your lure from an under water cam (which allows you to see fish location and exactly when your lure is attracting fish) or top water (which is, let's face it, much more realistic) you can choose which you prefer.  Plus you can change if you want to start out with the underwater cam and then move to the top water as you get better you can.

CONS:

1.  Again no two player game options.  If you select the easy mode, all you have to do is fish...most of the time you will win the competitions, and even if you go to a harder game play, most of the time just hang out for the whole time fishing and you can win easily.

2.  I really truly wish the guide was a little bit better, granted in reality fish will bite on whatever they fancy at the time.  But the game really doesn't provide much information as to fishing guides.  Like I said before I have never fished for Salmon...how am I to know what lures to use and what locations.  I don't want the game to give me all of the answers, but how about we start by having the guide (which can be annoying) provide some real advice as to what I am doing wrong, or how I can improve...if I ask for it.

Overall I think the game is a great buy just for the fact that it's kind of fun pulling in a Salmon up in Alaska, or a muskie or pike...instead of the usual games we see that are limited to bass.  Go for it...and let's see if you like it."

366795,4,"I have been eyeing this game since 2012 release in Japan and waited so long to be released in NA. And so far I have not been disappointed. I love RPG games that are mixed with simulation gameplay like rune factory, harvest moon, disneys magical world etc and Fantasy life is another one of those! I am only in about 4 hours but it looks promising! The vast world looks amazing and there's a DLC for 8.99 for purchase already for level 50+! So there's plenty to do! The story isn't deep (at least not yet) but dialogue is funny and entertaining enough. Only con so far is that the 3D is dated maybe because the game was made back in 2012 but very not impressed with the 3D like current year releases for the 3ds. Either way it's still an amazing game to relax and play. Highly recommend!"

227739,4,"If you, like me, are considering both the silicone and the clear plastic protectors from this brand, this review is for you.  I was given both for review and will focus on comparing them.

The clear protector is made of thin plastic that comes in a top and bottom piece which snap on and off easily (no damage).  While it looks dark in some pictures, it is transparent.  Some have commented on the little spots of condensation under the protector, which don't bother me at all.  I imagine these occur with any protector, but are evident in the clear ones.  In terms of protection, the plastic is not going to protect against major impacts.  Rather, it will prevent scratches from normal use.

The black silicone case comes in one piece and slips on and off very easily -- important because it blocks the SD card slot.  It looks just like a silicone case for a phone, which is good or bad, depending on preference.  I think the clear case looks better.  The silicone has a nice feel, but it makes the system more difficult to slip into my pocket for Streetpass action.  The silicone also covers the shoulder (top) buttons, which makes them a bit harder to push, but is good protection.  These buttons are exposed with the clear protector.  As with the clear protector, it only offers scratch, not impact, protection.

While both products are thin, they have enough thickness to prevent using the charging dock.  I really dislike this, and it could have been remedied by including a larger dock.  I can't imagine this would cost them much, since the docks are just plastic with contact pins.  The clear protector can even balance precariously in the dock and work.  The silicone case has a band which covers one of the dock connectors, though I'm sure it could be cut a bit to make room for the pins to connect.

A widespread complaint is that the lid of the 3DS closes too tightly, allowing the analog stick and bottom screen to make marks on the top screen.  The clear protector does nothing to address this, but the silicone protector sits inside the lid a bit, adding enough extra space to fix the problem.  I think this was total luck on the part of the manufacturer, but it is an elegant solution if you plan to use a protector anyway.

Overall, both protectors are very high quality, with a nice fit that is far superior to the ultra-cheap alternatives.  I prefer the clear case based on aesthetics and pocketability, but the added screen protection of the silicone protector has made it the permanent solution for my 3DS."
4727,4,"I had big worries about this game.  I used to play the old point and click adventures of indy and I was worried that, like its predisecors this would be insanley difficult.  Thankfully it is not.  I am a bad puzzle solver and luckily, (With the exception of the pyramid of the sun dial puzzle) none of the puzzles are that hard.  The graphics are quite nice and the levels are gigantic and tempt lots of exploration.  All of the characters are well done and interesting.  The music is nice and you have a lot of neat weapons to choose from.  However this game does have some flaws.  First off, sometimes you will be walking around wondering what the heck you are supposed to be doing.  Second, some of the enviorments are way too big.  The third and biggest flaw is that the last levels are way out of place.  The 2nd to last is strange but acceptable, but the last level is wayyyy out of place.  The last flaw is that the ending is really dissapointing.  Overall this is a fun game that will take up a lot of your time and is definatly one of the better Lucasarts titles."

 Although I can play it in 3D Vision on single 24"" 120hz monitor or 40"" 3DTV, I find the game looks best in regular HD or 4k displays... I however decided to dedicate a SoftTH profile to this splendid game from Activision and run it across all 3 of my displays at once! SoftTH is one of the coolest PC programs ever made, and when using the Widescreen Fixer (another free program) to correct the field of view in Transformers WFC, the game looks awesome output on my tri-display which is one 40"" Sharp 3DTV in landscape mode for the center display, and two 24"" LCD Monitors attached to either sides of the 40"" TV in portrait mode for a combined resolution of 3648 x 1152! SoftTH takes ANY monitor setup, any configuration and uses a logic calculator to appropriately stretch ANY game across the displays... It is free, make sure you also download both Widescreen Fixer and Flawless Widescreen as these can help with field of view and menu errors. :'D

The game itself is very well done, the physics, targeting and cut scenes are a pleasure to experience, just don't expect to find ANYTHING human or organic, cause the whole game takes place on Cybertron and there is no green there at all.  :p"

437602,4,"An enjoyable game that delivers what you want in a fighter. Loving the fight system and the characters are amazing (Luong is my new favorite!) They are all different and have likeable personalities. The soundtrack is pretty epic. Love the main theme and the BGM for the stages pumps me up.

The graphics aren't the best, but they're still pretty good. Don't expect Dead or Alive models. Some of the background stages look great and feel alive. The menu's are visually nice to look at, and there are plenty of modes to keep you busy.

The online is a little spotty. I'd say about 4 put of 10 matches I play don't lag. I've had the game freeze on me twice in 2 hours while playing online. Hopefully this gets fixed.

As a big KOF fan, I can honestly say ""Good job, SNK."" Hopefully this game gets the attention and love it deserves from other fighting game lovers."

This game is perhaps one of the biggest enigmas to come out of the video game industry. Despite the fact that Jaws Unleashed is a greatest hits title (which might surprise some, myself included), this game is still quite an undiscovered gem in the gaming universe. If you're willing to add something strange and fresh to your PS2 library and have a few bucks to spare, Jaws is a terrific choice.

As I browsed the PS2 section in my local electronics store looking for a new game to play, I decided on Jaws Unleashed. There was something about it: it's an old classic movie.. adapted to a game? What?? I chose this game over other more popular titles like Devil May Cry, God Hand, Burn Out, and Kingdom Hearts. RPGs, fighters, FPS, platformers, sports... Jaws doesn't really qualify under any specific genre. I mean, you play as a shark whose purpose is to wreak havoc to everyone and anything. It set it apart from all the other games being sold around it.

The game is just hilarious. You know you're in for something different when you see a shark taking a bite out of a killer whale on the back cover. Created by the same developers behind the Ecco the Dolphin series, Jaws is that series' evil incarnation. As Ecco, you play a lovable hero. As Jaws, you play a godless killing machine. You could tell the developers let themselves loose when making this title, evident in such bonus games like biting a girl swimmer to bang her against a yellow buoy within 20 seconds. It had me and my friends laughing. When was the last a game did that?

This is certainly not an A+ game, because the control can get frustrating and the camera needs major tweaking. However, in a video game world dominated by Final Fantasies, Legend of Zeldas, Halos, and those never-ending EA Sports franchises, Jaws Unleashed is a different yet welcome title. If you played Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future (which I also liked), Jaws Unleashed is similar in style and execution, but more sinister and fun. Jaws is not a must-buy title, but it certainly won't hurt to sink your teeth into it. Enjoy!"

Overall Game Play - 8/10

I really enjoyed this game, I really enjoy the Killzone series! This was the first game I got for my PS4 console! This game is extremely challenging compared to other FPS. Battlefield and CoD I can beat the hardest difficulty without too much trouble but this one I had to step down to the normal difficulty, I am planning on trying the hardest again in the near future.

If you enjoy FPS games then I would absolutely recommend you try this one!"

284908,4,"Pros:
+Cheap!
+Easy to put on and take off
+Not too bulky

Cons:
-Once it's on, you cannot fit the GamePad in the official Wii U charging cradle as the listing would lead you to believe (""Precise openings on the protector case to allow access to all controls and features."")

Overall, for $2.40, this is definitely a great option for a GamePad case. I bought one because I have the special edition Zelda GamePad, and I wanted to see the design without ruining the controller. I assumed since the listing said it allows access to all features, that it would charge in the charging cradle, but like I said, once it's on, it doesn't fit in the cradle. It's a bummer, but I didn't pay $20 for the case so I can't really complain."

62739,4,"Hey all this is Sam AKA Para in the gaming review community. This is one of many gaming reviews I will be starting for Amazon, so I hope you enjoy. Going to be talking about Champions Return to Arms and what I think is a great game. First off let's talk about the story, without going into too much detail; I must say the story is decent, could be better. There could have been some cut scenes that made this feel more intense but it was just a simple NPC that would talk to you. Mind you when they talked, their mouths didn't move with the words which made it feel a little cheap. I understand this is an old game but it could have looked better. The voice acting was nice though for people who hate to read or players who just want to feel like they know the character talking to them. Story could have been better like I said but it is still fun to see how it all ends.

Now for the gameplay, it was nice visually and audio wise. I loved watching the spells like fire balls explode on an enemy and with that the sounds are just amazing. Also what was amazing was the water when you walked through it and hearing the water splash around you, which was done very well. The game controls were very easy to learn to and the skill wheel was nice but at times annoying. Boss fights take some time which is a good thing if you are not dying so fast. The save points throughout the levels help a lot and I cannot stress enough to save save save and save often only because you do not want to lose everything you found and have to start all over. The way they handled the camera for single player was done well, but again gets annoying when in small places and you cannot see your character. Fun gameplay though and you won't regret it.

Now for online/multiplayer which I can say is fun to play with friends but very frustrating too. Why frustrating you might ask and that is because of the camera. I will throw this example out there and it was with me and my friend, I was trying to grab a chest while he wanted to move forward and apparently he was being attack but because I was on the other side of the camera angle he could not see the enemy and then cause the camera angle moved again he got stuck until I moved to his location which by time I moved he died. So not having split screen or being stuck on the same screen really does render the game fun if people want to move forward fast or if one players wants to go left and the other go right, just does not work. Don't let this stop you though, it is fun to play online and is very helpful to have the added players.

Overall Sony has done a great job on the series but just has minor flaws. Fun and enjoyable though and should be played.

Score out of 4.5

Concept/Story: 3*, As I said the story could have been better with maybe some cut scenes or just an overall better story outline, it was just plain.

Graphics: 5*, Much improved from the first game. The environments and characters and effects are superb.

Sound: 5*, With great graphics you must have great sound effects and they have pulled it off flawlessly. Voice acting was a +.

Entertainment Value: 4*, Fun with friends and even solo as long as you can deal with the overhead camera movement. Boss fights are great and take strategy so you are not dying foolishly.

Control: 4*, Not really hard to learn, but the skill wheel can get annoying.

Replay Value: 4*, Playing with friends is fun and fighting in the arena to see how many waves you can complete will keep you coming back for more.

Thank you for your time, hope this review helps with your decision to buy the game. Take my word or don't take it, but this is a game you will be happy with purchasing."
97099,4,"MP8 is a buy; the boards are fun and the gameplay too. The story should not be considered because the type of game; but it is good. The mini games are solid and only a few are terrible. The bonus sections are like always a waste but playing with your Mii is cool. Add this to your library. Check out MP9 coming on 3-11-12. Also I reccomend (MP1 (best), MP2 (On Virtual Console), MP4, MP5); try (MP6, MP7); avoid (MP3, MP DS, MP Advance)."

31179,4,"This is a very good gamepad. Immediate benefit is not having a cord.  My setup has me playing games on my tv, and needing to be within a few feet of the computer to play on the tv is not good.  This gives you range and versatility. Easy to install, and the software is rather simple to go through.
In addition, you can program your gamepad for virtually any game.  This isn't foolproof, though.  I tried doing that for RtCW and I was limited to a certain range of viewability and aiming. So I couldn't play that game with it.  However, plenty of other games work well with it."
22467,4,"This was actually the title that made me buy the GBA. The original NES version of this game is an all-time favorite of mine, and the idea of carrying around the game in my pocket was just too cool.
So what has changed? The biggest change is the new anime feel of the characters. This is the biggest disappointment- the originals were appealing in their own way, and the anime look for the most part makes all the teams generic.
The important things are the same, however. Same gameplay. Same cool power throws (and more!). Same little angel version of character once they die.
If you enjoyed the simple joy of launching a ball into the face of your opponents and watching them fly off the screen, then this is a must buy."
284404,4,"If you are like me you're probably approaching Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS 2) wondering why you have a strange fascination with a game that simulates a job. And not a particularly grandiose job either. Sure you have your surgeon simulator, even your farm simulators, and the perennial god-like mayoral simulators in games like SimCity and Cities XL. But a game about driving a truck across vast expanses? Thats just silly or is it? I purchased this game during the Steam Winter Sale 13 and Im completely hooked. If you're a simulator junkie, enjoy building up your little empire from meager beginnings, and the thought of the open road in massive, lumbering multi-axel vehicles is appealing then this is your game!

--------------------
GAMEPLAY:

Youll start by creating a user profile (registration with the developer is optional), picking a name for in-game persona, selecting an avatar, choosing a title for your company, and selecting a starting point from slew of cities in Western Europe. Your garage is a small sort of dumpy one-stall that will serve as the base for your trucking empire. At the onset you have no choice but to take contract jobs from other established trucking companies hauling freight on a one-off basis for cash.

Eventually you can either save enough cash or borrow from the bank and purchase your own truck. Owning your own rig is really the meat of ETS 2. Once you own your own truck you can take better jobs for better pay.

The games interface is a clean and easy to navigate menu of icons. Youll select your next job from a menu that features the trailer you're hauling, the cargo contents, distance, recommended GPS route and most importantly the pay. You can filter each job by various criteria including, total pay, pay per kilometer, origin, destination.

Eventually youll be able to buy more trucks and hire more drivers and build your company into a real freight-hauling powerhouse. Truck manufacturers, recruitment centers all have to be discovered in each city. So the game encourages you to explore a bit. The in-game map is very extensive and covers the location of each area in fantastic detail. My understanding of the game is that the routes mirror their real-world counterparts quite well.

Your drivers also feature a leveling system. Each driver can invest skill points into a number of areas from being able to haul longer distances, to ADR certifications for hauling dangerous cargos, fragile or time sensitive freight and more. As you level better paying jobs will open up. Your hired drivers will also level and you can set their training priorities.

Trucks feature customizable parts from engines and transmissions to aesthetic components like side-skirts, wheels, lights and much more.

The game does support keyboard + mouse configurations, controllers and best of all wheels. Im using a Logitech Driving Force GT and the experience is fantastic. Lots of options to customize controls and tweak the feel of the trucks are present in the menu.

--------------------
GRAPHICS:

In short the graphics are pretty great. This game doesnt feature any type of crazy effects but the environments are rendered very nicely. Weather effects like rain and fog are perhaps the most impressive aspect to the engine. The draw of the open road and the occasional vista be it seeing the ocean in Calais or the forested expanse of Germany is very nice.

--------------------
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT ETS 2:

 The game doesnt really have an objective other than growing your business and acquiring more trucks and drivers but it is strangely addictive and relaxing. Driving a haul from point to point and seeing more of Europe is really just a cool experience.

 Lots of trucks from a lot of vendors including: Scania, Volvo, Iveco, Majestic (Mercedes), MAN, Renault, and DAF. All feature fully rendered interiors with working gauges.

 The map is absolutely huge and features large chunks from major Euro nations including Germany, Northern Italy, Eastern France, Netherlands, Great Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, and more.

 The menus and in-game aids like GPS routing are intuitive and easy to use. Mapping controls to my wheel is also very easy.

 Fantastic user community with a lot of folks making some excellent mods. Mods do everything from changing paint schemes to interior truck makeovers. Larger mods change the made-up in-game companies to real-world companies. Other mods add to the map such as adding all of Hungary or more cities to Italy. The developer has really made their game accessible to modders and the game features a menu to manage mods.

 Streaming live radio broadcasts from Europe through the game into the cab of your truck. Seriously, as an American I have grown to love Euro radio.

--------------------
WHAT I DONT LIKE ABOUT ETS 2:

 The in-game truck customization from the developer are a bit limited. The modding community has done admirably to pick up the slack.

 European cities are well represented but are extremely small in-game. Like a few blocks small. After a time you realize that instead of driving through the streets of Munich or Paris exploring your surroundings in a huge rig youll just quickly drive the few square blocks in each to discover the local truck vendor and recruitment agency and move on.

--------------------
OTHER NOTES
One of my biggest questions was about how long a typical haul between cities takes. The answer is that no, the game doesnt simulate the actual time to drive between cities, that would be insane, however expect hauls to take a chunk of time. For instance and in-game haul of approximately 3hrs might take 20 minutes of real world time."
143821,4,"A fun challenge like most Rock Star games. Plenty to do to keep you busy, giant map, tons of side capers, and nothing too complicated that you can't set it down for a week or two and get lost. Some of the classes get pretty frustrating (the button mashers... Damn Music Class) but still a great game that survives the test of time. Blow off some steam, relive (some kind of) childhood, and be the jerk you always knew you could be."

64588,4,"""Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones"" is a great Strategy RPG, not just for the GBA but for any system.  This is somewhat unsurprising, since the ""Fire Emblem"" series was developed decades ago and has been a fixture of Nintendo consoles since the original NES.  The first FE to grace our shores was the seventh title in the series, ""Blazing Sword,"" which was released as simply ""Fire Emblem"" here.  That was an excellent, challenging, and quite long game with a first-rate story (although the fact you were an actual character, of sorts, didn't jive with some people).  Nintendo's decision to introduce North Americans to the FE series with that game was, in retrospect, somewhat surprising, since it was actually a prequel to the sixth FE game, ""The Sword of Seals.""  ""The Sacred Stones"" is the eighth game in the series, and this is the one for the mainstream.  You get three difficulty levels right off the bat, the option of choosing two different lords with different stories, and a story that, while still good, is noticeably smaller in scale compared to the epic narrative of the last game.  Even with the three difficulty settings, any seasoned FE player will tell you the real challenge is choosing to abuse or not abuse various aspects of the gameplay.  For example, it is clear in SS that one of the main lords, Ephraim, is probably the strongest lord character yet in a FE game, I'd say even stronger than Hector.  He definitely bucks the trend of ""weak FE lords.""  Eirika, on the other hand, is probably one of the weakest.  You can also use the ""abuse Arena"" trick to quickly level up your characters and buildup funds (something SS really doesn't let you do).  In addition, new gameplay mechanics force the player to enact new choices.  For example, there is a new system in SS where you get to choose which class to change a character to.  Which class is right for that particular character depends mainly on how well you can read their stat levels.  However, some classes are much, some would say too much, better than others.  For example, you can change your pegasus knight into either a falcoknight or a wyvern knight.  Wyverns are known for their good defense against melee weapons but weak resistance against magic.  But, pegasus knights have high resistance.  So, each pegasus knight you change into a wyvern knight gains the aforementioned melee adeptness as well as retains their original high magic resistance.  Another example is the Bishop class.  Many of the enemies you will encounter in SS are monsters.  Bishops gain an ""always-on"" skill called ""Slayer,"" which makes their attacks especially effective against monsters.  Why would you choose any other class?  After all, FE has really always been about, namely, who has the better weapon (although some would say the weapons triangle and trinity of magic makes things a bit too extreme, as what weapon a character wields also affects seemingly unrelated things like evasion).  There is a class, Assassin, that isn't even mentioned in the instruction manual, which is bound to cause confusion among novices.  Speaking of weapons, you will find that, mainly because of who your enemies are, some weapons are just more effective than others.  For examples, in SS, there aren't enough strong enemy axe wielders around, so lances are the most useful of the melee weapons.  As mentioned before, light magic seems to be the most effective, not just because of monsters, but because it always seems to work best against the game-end bosses.  Perhaps this is necessary, as light magic is strong against dark magic, and, of course, evildoers more than likely will be using dark magic.  Even so, the question must be raised: why even have S-rank weapons for every weapon class then?  If only two or three of them are going to be effective for the boss, why have so many at all?  I, for one, don't like the feeling of using my S-rank weapon against a few grunts.  These questions certainly don't just apply to SS.  Something in SS that everyone will, except diehard knight and cavalry fans, agree on is the improved effectiveness of the flying units.  In FE7, the flying units seemed to be really underpowered.  Though I suspect this probably has to do most with the fact there are less enemy archer units in this game, it's still nice to have Vanessa be the one to take down the Demon King in this game instead of watching Florina die over and over and over in the last game.  We'll see what the next FE, a GameCube game called ""Path of Radiance,"" is like, though I hope to see this series go to the DS soon.  Maybe a new character class change system will be implemented where the character will automatically change into a class the game deems it best suited to being, based on combat habits and techniques.  Who knows?"
44040,4,"Be Forewarned: This game is NOT recommended for younger gamers due to the excessive violence, sex (R-rated), and crime related storyline.
I recently got this game via online auction for $10; just curious what all the hype was about.  Let's get straight to the point:
The GOOD:  Entertaining voice acting by Ray Liotta (Tommy Vercetti the main character), Dennis Hopper (Steve Scott, the porn king), Burt Reynolds (Avery Carrington, real estate mobster), Philip Michael Thomas (Lance Vance, Tommy's buddy), Deborah Harry (Taxi controller), Jenna Jameson (porn star), etc.  Facinating storyline with funny plot twists.  Open game format allows playing missions in any order you want, do what you want.  LOTS of cars, motorcycles, planes, trucks, ambulances, helos, speedboats, RC airplanes, etc. to commandeer and wreak havoc.  LOTS of weapons ranging from butcher knife to RPGs.  LOTS of 80s music (Blondie, Rick James, A Flock of Seagulls, Wang Chung, Michael Jackson, etc) and chat parody on radio stations whenever inside a vehicle.  Well plotted out city streets and ability to buy real estate and business properties as the game progresses.  Some missions are tough and need careful planning and weapons selection. Add your own MP3s to listen to! You can even pick up hookers if you're driving a nice car.  Just too much goodies!!!
The BAD:  Awkward 3rd person view of main character (views can only be changed in vehicles) which means sometimes a structure or the back of Tommy's head can be blocking your view of the enemies.  Background graphics can become ungainly and bulky close up (Kind of reminds me of old Tomb Raider games).  Vehicle dynamics are purely video game style/not realistic simulations.  Games can't be saved during missions and can only be done at ""save"" houses/properties. Vehicles always exploded when turned over even when there's minimal damage.
The UGLY: Game sometimes lock up (at the car dealership) even with video setting at my desktop 1280x1024x32 native resolution.  The newest patch didn't help.  Last but NOT least:  TOMMY CAN'T SWIM!!!
Bottom Line:  FUN and entertaining game at parties.  NOT for younger kids or the politically correct.  The 80's music collection ALONE is worth getting this game!"
131650,4,For all of us especially the grands it plays fun and does provide hours of entertainment. It is great for a starter game for the little ones.
92424,4,"I had no problems with this device. I installed the software from the included and Windows picked it right up and I was ready to go.  One note though, if a game does not automatically detect the 360 controller and configure it you may have to go find a program that lets you map keyboard commands to the controller so you can play games that way.  I used Xpadder which has both a free and paid version but there are several others out there."

53035,4,"""Pitch Black"" was a good movie, despite what it obviously owed to films like ""Alien,"" but its sequel, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" felt like it took place in an entirely different universe, and traded its predecessor's character depth and moody tension in for choppy, overblown action. In case you're wondering, the Xbox shooter ""Escape From Butcher Bay"" takes place in the latter setting, but at least it allows Riddick to curse and kill in a non-PG-13 environment (a luxury the edited film didn't have). On top of that, it offers some very fine first-person gaming. Even so, despite much of the recent hype surrounding it, it has more than its fair share of problems - not unlike the movie to which it's tied.
You're cast as Richard B. Riddick (of course), recently captured and imprisoned in the maximum security prison that is Butcher Bay. The order of the day: escape. That's easier said than done, of course, what with the fact that you're virtually unarmed and faced with an army of armed guards and angry prisoners. The storyline does its job well, and the game's to be commended for not trying to merely recreate the movie's storyline (see ""Van Helsing"" or ""The Return of the King""). A star-studded cast ups the production value and manages to make you feel like you're actually playing a pequel movie, but the story never really hits its stride and it scarcely meshes well with ""Pitch Black.""
Gameplay-wise, ""Riddick"" is a real winner. Despite the fact that it's played almost entirely from a first person perspective, it feels like a third person action game. Gunplay aside, you'll find yourself going hand-to-hand with some of the game's enemies and performing ""Tenchu""-like stealth kills. The FPS stuff isn't half bad either, and owes a serious debt to ""Halo"" (even if it never attains that game's greatness). I'd go so far as to say that ""Butcher Bay"" offers the best combination of stealth and action gameplay that I've ever seen. If you've played the recent ""Breakdown,"" you have an idea what to expect - but as far as the game's controls are concerned, it easily surpasses the aforementioned title.
What ""Butcher Bay"" lacks are unique and varied environments. By choosing to set the game entirely in a prison setting, the developers obviously limited themselves. Even so, the mostly cramped indoor environments are highly atmospheric - it's just too bad you'll feel like you're moving down the same hallway over and over again throughout much of the game. Some creepy caverns and abandoned mines come into play (and offer opponents that are less than human), but there's very little to break up the monotony.
Visually, ""Butcher Bay"" is a mixed bag. The game's engine allows for some very moody lighting, and its character models and textures are particularly impressive. It's actually one of the best looking Xbox games ever made, but there are problems as well. To keep it from chugging, some distant objects and/or characters become extremely fuzzy, or even pixelated. Sometimes it's hard to notice, and other times you'll find yourself rubbing at your eyes. At its worst, it can be a little disconcerting.
""Butcher Bay"" is one of those games that starts off with more promise than it ultimately finishes with, but despite its shortcomings it's easily one of the best video game/Hollywood unions ever. The action and stealth elements make for equally effective bedfellows, and demand that you play this game.
Final Score: B+"
409655,4,"I've been buying FIFA for many years and football games since I was a teenager, and I'm 41 now ;-). In fact, I still have some of the PS2 and PS3 copies of those games. But at the end of 2014, I gave PES2015 a chance and I actually bought both games, FIFA15 and PES2015. I was playing back and forth PES and FIFA until I realized that I was enjoying PES much better (even though I was losing at times) This was when I witness myself of the change PES has been made on Football games and on me, giving a bigger emphazise on passing and strategy instead of pace.

This year I bought PES2016 and I will not buy FIFA16. I played the FIFA16 Demo and did not like it. Something drastically will have to happen later this year, like a huge patch released by EA or something to change my mind. And it's not that FIFA16 is a bad game, it's that it remains the same and that's what bothers me: pace based football game with little or no care about passing, formations or gameplay.

Here are a few of the reasons why I like PES2016:

-Extremely fluid gameplay.
-Less arcade football game.
-Much better passing and build up game.
-Better AI (players move forward after passing the ball or create spaces depending of the situation)
-Dynamic weather
-Collision dynamics.

True, PES still does not have all the licenses but who cares... on the pitch, where it really matters, at least for me, it's fantastic. You really enjoy picking formations or building up your play based on the players you have. You don't depend of pace only for that.

There are a few things I don't like though, the game is not perfect, of course:

-Commentary team better than PES2015 but still bad.
-Improved menus but lack of visual appealing.

I think that PES2016 translates what football is with much more fidelity. Football is a game of strategy, looking for open spaces, do nice passes, you can accomplish that on PES2015 beautifly.

PS:
You can still get official kits via imports, which is now new on PES2016. This explains how: http://youtu.be/fGq-0vJ71UA"
302108,4,"I have WWE '09 and '12...I think this game is much better.  I love the 30 years of WrestleMania and I love the roster.  I really don't understand anyone who would compare it to Fire Pro Returns because that's like apples and oranges and THIS is the game being reviewed.  I played it 6 hours straight yesterday and only had two major complaints.  1.  There are some issues with sound mixing with the announcers when you choose the retro WrestleMania arenas.  I normally wouldn't complain about anything that trivial but it is just annoying and I think they should do some kind of audio patch.  2.  As with the other games in recent past, the split second timing needed for reversals is a little too difficult to pull off with any regularity so it feels like hopeful button mashing frenzy. However, pulling off a few reversals in a row is a really great feeling....maybe I just need to get better at it because right now it feels like luck, not skill.

The pros?  Well there are just tons of pros.  I don't know what people expect with graphics but I found it to be very impressive.  Not as many ""glitchy"" issues like arms disappearing into the opponents body and stuff like with previous titles. Sure things like that happen but with less frequency in this game. This game is certainly the best looking and I even let a few com vs com fights go so I could just watch.  I think the camera is better this time, too.

ROSTER.  period.  Come on...there's never been a bigger, better roster.  Mick Foley vs Bryan Daniels???  Yes! Yes! Yes!

Having played many wrestling games over the years since WrestleMania for NES, I really believe this is the best over all game to date in the modern/current console era.  Being an old gamer, I am NOT crazy about buying a game and then spending so much more on DLC.  I did however buy the Accelerator package for two bucks to open all unlockables because it makes it a better gaming experience for me.  I would buy a DLC that offers the Wyatt Family though...Oh, create a superstar hasn't really changed that I can tell and I usually enjoy that part as well.  I am not a good enough player to be interested in online warfare so I can't rate that part.  I certainly think this is a great game and well worth the purchase.  ** I have amended my initial review and have given the fun score an additional star after having played 8 more hours.  I've primarily given this additional star for the extreme satisfaction of beating Stephanie McMahon to a pulp repeatedly---this is the first time in a game she is playable in Divas."
190853,4,"Like the Lego games, this one allows two people to work together to achieve the tasks.  It is fun -- the characters are great and sound great.  The laugh track, like in the shows from the 70/80's was a cute touch.  It plays very much like the Lego games -- if you like those, you will enjoy this one, too."
390480,4,"Great headset for a great price. Also very easy to utilize. Only gripe is that it is USB, so it doesn't get the same quality of sound output as a 3.5 jack. Still, for the price you just can't beat it."
84256,4,"Killzone 2 had over two years of hype to live up to, following the infamous E3 trailer which displayed a game so graphically advanced, few thought it would even live up to the visual standard. Fortunately for the folks at Guerrilla Games - and for us - Killzone 2 lived up to the hype in almost every regard, delivering one of the best first-person shooter experiences out there and effectively raising the bar for shooters to come.

Killzone 2 puts you in the shoes of Sev, a member of the four-man Alpha Team. After repelling the Helghast attack on their home planet of Vekta, the ISA decided to launch a counterattack, bringing the fight to the desolate and volatile world of Helghan. The ISA hoped to quickly remove Emperor Visari, believing Helghast morale was at a low; instead, they're met with heavy resistance, which Alpha Team has to take care of along with the rest of the ISA forces. While not a groundbreaking narrative, the story works better than it does in most shooters and the characters as a whole aren't bad, despite the testosterone-heavy dialogue riddled with expletives. The story is at its best in moving the campaign forward, which grabs hold of you from the onset and refuses to let you go through the remarkably intense, adrenaline-pumping, and immersive action.

The immersion and spectacle is due in part to the spectacular presentation of the game, which does well to make you feel as if you were really dropped in the middle of a war zone. As opposed to many games these days, the most exhilarating edge-of-your-seat moments happen in-game, and not during cutscenes. The game is a technical masterpiece that all shooters will be compared to from now on. Visually, it's a stunner. The lighting effects are particularly impressive, as everything in the game casts some amount of light, from the flash of a smoking barrel to the eerie glow of a Helghast helmet. Particle effects are also implemented beautifully as items lit on fire burn to a floating ash and dust is often kicked up into the air, temporarily obscuring your vision. The environments are also incredibly detailed and diverse, but more importantly, they're often destructible adding another layer of immersion and realism to the battlefield while also adding the fear of your cover breaking down around you, leaving you vulnerable. All of the ambient and chaotic noises are also done masterfully in 7.1 sound, not only adding yet another layer of realism, but mixing with an excellent soundtrack.

As remarkable as the game is, there are a few technical hiccups that will occur. However, the only reason they are even noticeable is because they stick out in a game that is otherwise perfect on a technical scale. Most notable is the occasional pause in the action as the game loads the next segment, as the game forgoes the install at the beginning. Of course, the trivial nature of such technical complaints should only prove to illustrate how much of a powerhouse the game truly is.

The single player campaign only clocks in at about 8-10 hours, but provides plenty of replay value with increased difficulty levels and trophies. The gameplay itself should be similar to what most players with FPS experience are accustom to, though Killzone 2 is a bit more of a tactical shooter than most, utilizing a unique cover system. Going in guns blazing might work partially well for the lowest difficulty, but properly utilizing the cover system becomes absolutely necessary for the increased difficulties because of the excellent enemy AI. Thankfully, your squadmates' AI is just as advanced; as opposed to just being meat shields, they'll often take out enemies you might have missed or alert you to enemies you weren't aware of. You're given one primary weapon, two types of grenades, and a secondary weapon, which is always a pistol, but incredibly useful as it has unlimited ammo. The primary options range from the expected, such as machine guns and assault rifles, to a few unique and fun weapons such as the flamethrower, bolt gun, and another particularly fun weapon that you're allowed access to only in one of the later levels. In addition to those options and melee kills, you also have a combat knife, which can slice through enemies with brutal efficiency.

Once you've completed the enthralling single-player campaign, there is an incredibly deep and incredibly fun multiplayer component awaiting you. The two options available are ""Skirmish"" and ""Warzone"". Skirmish allows different gamemodes offline with bots, while Warzone is the actual online multiplayer component. Skirmish is fun, it can help new players learn the maps, and the bots' AI acts fairly similar to actual players, but the lack of local multiplayer in Skirmish was a bit of a letdown, because killing bots can only stay fresh for so long without the trash-talking and camaraderie of actual players. In fact, the lack of co-op - local or online - in the single-player campaign as well was another decision that left me scratching my head, as the squad-based gameplay is ideal for cooperative play.

Warzone is a blast and the depth it holds is sure to keep players playing for months as well as drag players away from other popular online games. It features all of the standard game modes and a few new ones, such as Assassination. Furthermore, objectives change on the fly when you select a full Warzone game that will switch between the five game modes. Matchmaking is a breeze and the online maps are designed perfectly for hectic fragfests, which can hold as many as 32 players. While Guerrilla forgoes the options of customizable skins for your fighters, there's plenty of customization in the form of character classes and the application of badges, which offer various abilities and help create characters of unique skill sets.

Killzone 2 may not do much to bring new players into the genre, but it gives shooter fans a great reason to keep playing them. If you're a fan of shooters or even just remarkably impressive technology, Killzone 2 is a must buy, without a doubt. The campaign offers a wide variety of challenge, unlockables, and ridiculously fun chaos. The multiplayer takes the game a step further with incredibly depth that's sure to keep people playing into the foreseeable future. Gamers wanted to know whether Killzone 2 would be the huge, great system-seller they all thought it would be. The answer is a loud, unequivocal ""yes""."
106171,4,no joysticks like ps2 but you can use it for ps2 on some game its for only ps1 game basically if your goanna play ps1 ps2 controller work to and better this old thing is very useful to no joysticks in the way so get the party started aha aha aha ya
459434,4,"This is a fast-moving set of games and not violent.  The graphics are ok, maybe overly hyped, and the complexities make it challenging."
51129,4,"Sure your fancy xbox has better graphics but its made by the biggest nerd in the worlds company, so DUH! PS2 has way funner games and the controllers are way easier to use than those fat ass xbox controllers. You don't have to pay for the online(unlike xbox) so you can play without charge. you can use the DVD player without buying a remote, but it makes it easier ifyou do. Its way smaller and doesnt take up space like fat ass xbox (ever noticed how everything about xbox is fat? Hmm wonder why!) any way PS2 is way better than GC and Xbx so get this instead!"
147338,4,The art style is really cool.  It's pretty much a Zelda rip-off.  That doesn't mean that it's not fun.  There is a surprising amount of diversity in the way you'll be playing.  The brush mechanic is really cool.  It adds something to the game that is fairly unique and imaginative.  There are a few minigames which make for more variety in gameplay.  There are some surprisingly difficult side-quests which take a fair bit of time to finish.  I am a bit of a completionist and it took me over 50 hours to get everything.  I would recommend this game to pretty much anyone.
297876,4,"I bought this after my circlepad broke. I had to replace the official Nintendo circlepad with a plastic one. But these rubber pads are pretty good. the box comes with 6 pads, but 3 of them are pretty bad. It also comes with a chain that can hold 2 pads and can tie onto your 3ds, so you can bring them wherever you go. If you have a hard time gripping your thumb on the circlepad, you should try these out."
459167,4,Pretty fun game...
59057,4,"Bought it when it first came out & haven't stopped yet. I have a PS3 & have TW09 & TW10 but i still like this one the most. To me this one is the easiest to play & I like having up to 34 tournaments a season to compete in, the newer games only have 20 tournament seasons. On TW05 you can play tournaments with multiple profiles at the same time, up to four, something else you can't do on the newer games. Also, the newer games drop your abilities down some when you have bad rounds so you constantly have to keep your player practicing when not playing in actual tournaments to keep up their attributes, this is a serious pain & takes up un-necesary time that you could be progressing through the games. On TW05, once your guy or girl is maxed out, they stay that way no matter how lousy a round you have. I also like the trophy room portion of the game. The only thing this game doe's not do is track how many victories you have in career mode, they tell you how you did at the end of the year as far as wins & money & the money carries over because there's a goal on the game to finaly catch & surpass Tigers winnisgs but they do not carry wins over. I wish EA would just make an updated version of this exact game with all the same options, all they need to do is update the graphics for PS3. If you still have a PS2 & want a fun & easy to play version of Tiger Woods golf for the whole family, pick this one up."

277853,4,"I bought this controller looking for something portable to go with my Asus gaming laptop.

It takes a while to charge the controller when you first get it. I suspect most of the DOA people are not charging them long enough before using them. I thought mine was dead, but after 2 hours of charging it started right up.

I did the firmware update from their website. However, in windows device manager under properties, the L2 and R2 buttons didn't register. Sent an email to their help line at Nyko and I was mailed a second firmware update that was different than the one on their site. It fixed the issue, but the select button didn't work. Oh well, that's the least used button.

Buttons are responsive. I have bluetooth 4.0 on my laptop, and there's no input lag. Played games like Skyrim and Arkham city perfectly.

For $15 this was a great controller. I bought a second as well. Portable sized gamepads with the full button layout that work for PC are rare or extremely expensive. This is a good Gamepad for those reasons."
227798,4,"This is one of those items that you don't necessarily think you need until you see that large nasty scratch across your screen. For all of my devices that have screens I have protective covers for them. It's a peace of mind that if something does get scratched you peel it off and put another back on. Much better than it being on the actual screen.

These are easy to apply. No issues there at all.

My one hiccup with these are the price. I can go to a local store and buy a pack of cut-to-fit screen protectors for about half of what these retail for. One pack would be two complete applications (top and bottom screens) where as this is one application. So that's the only caution I would suggest for this item.

It does work as described though."
365662,4,"Surprisingly, in a year of overhyped games, this game is actually pretty addictive.  This is a game where the fun factor is the main focus of game, and it's really enjoyable for it.  The multiplayer mode can be quite a blast, and there are even Splatfests every now and then, where you pick from something like ""Marshmallow vs Hotdogs"" and fight against those who choose differently.  (Isn't fighting against those with different opinions fun?)  This is also one of those rare games, though a good amount of Nintendo games do have this feature, with a local multiplayer mode in it.  Of course, most in the age of online connectivity won't care that much about it, but for those who prefer local multiplayer or can't go online, this is a welcoming feature.  I just wish the servers are a bit better, as I remembered being able to play online on a weaker network than what I have right now.  This game also has a singleplayer mode, which is pretty light on the story and can be summed up in less than 5 minutes, but the levels are pretty fun, and I don't think the boss fights are that bad.  Your character is also customizable, though don't expect to go into a store in-game and just buy something for your Squid Kid.  You do have to play a few games online, up to level 4 to buy something from all stores, which isn't a big deal if you're able to play online.  Otherwise, this game is pretty much an addictive one, and it surpassed my expectations, which hasn't happened that much as of late."
156918,4,"I've had this game for about a little over a month now and I can't get enough of it. I'm only on my tenth season and still climbing the events on the ""Serious"" difficulty setting, it hasn't been too hard or too easy. The only thing I'm not much of a fan of is the LeMans event and the limited amount of races you have in a season. The online gameplay can get a little competitive at times (..or just my lack of skills and knowledge of tracks, haha) which only makes me want to get better and practice more. Compared to PGR and Forza I would have to say it's a go between and all in all a great game with awesome graphics and gameplay :D Enjoy"
79907,4,"Chromehounds is a mech simulator.  It may sound obvious, but a lot of people seem to think it's the next Mechwarrior.  Mechwarrior (for x-box) was an arcade game that was simple to play and easy to learn.  Chromehounds is much more difficult to play and the learning curve is very steep.

The single player story mode is shallow and really nothing more than a glorified trainer for the x-box live version.  In fact, if you don't have x-box live gold, this game isn't even worth renting.

The graphics run from very good to pretty poor.  The mechs look great and are highly detailed.  You can customize your mech with a ton of camoflauge patterns and decals.  The environments, on the other hand, are pretty sappy.  Buildings, grass, and sand look pretty bland.

The mech customization is really the key to play (otherwise equally powered mechs would just be strafing each other and whoever has slightly better aim would win).  You can load up on weapons and armor, at the expense of speed.  There are TONS of weapons, legs, and cockpits.  You can carry missle counters, thermal vision, night vision, and other ""assist"" parts.

X-box live featurs a ""war"" with three warring nations.  Every player must pick allegiance to one nation (though you can change allegiances) and you can go on missions for your country.  The goal of each mission is to destroy the enemy's HQ while defending your own.  You also win, but get less points, if you destroy the other team's mechs.

X-box live also features ranked and unranked games so you can just try out your mech against other players before taking it on the campaign.

This game is complex and it takes a while to figure out how to build the right mech for the right mission.  My only real complaint is going on missions requires you join up with your squad.  If you've ever been in a ""clan"" on x-box live, you know how hard it is to link up with your team to play other teams.  Overall, this game offers a unique mech simulator that assures players won't necessarily be beaten by trash talking 13 year olds with excellent hand eye coordination."
88877,4,"So I bought this game for my nephew this Xmas and we opened it up on Xmas eve (we are playing now). All I can say is that this is one fun title. Although this may seem that the title is for the younger crowd, its actually pretty fun for adults as well.

At first RRR seemed like another one of those games that were released too early and had little value in it. Things initially were pretty easy and it got boring. The graphics looked blocky (think Nintendo Game Cube) and the shading/lighting experience basic, but don't get me wrong - this doesn't distract from the game. With the Wii, play value and just having fun is the norm and this is a great launch game for the console. Rayman Raving Rabbids is a kick and pushes play controller usage in all directions.

As the challenges progressed, it gets ""goofy fun"" and we were all on the floor laughing at the stupid stuff we were doing. Some of the mini-games can be frustrating for the younger kids but like most things, you have to keep persevering to finish the level. It requires some pretty good dexterity using both the nunchuck and wii controller.

Although there are over 70 mini-games, we have only gone through a dozen of them and its been a blast. The really fun games are the shoot 'em up plunger action challenges, the cow tossing and the disco dancing. Although this game may seem suitable for the younger kids, it really isn't - it can be enjoyed by people of all ages and in a group.

Weird, dorky and fun!"
225983,4,"Binary Domain is a game that I feel sorry for...Oh not that it's a bad game, in fact it's actually really good.  But it's like a film that happens to opens up sandwiched between a couple of blockbusters and gets lost in the shuffle.  It's a game that came out with little fanfare...which is Sega's fault...but a game that is quite good...also Sega's fault.  Binary Domain is a squad/cover based shooter set in the year 2080.  Robots have become the primary work force in the world.  A new Geneva Convention agreement has banned robots that are able to pass themselves off as humans.  A Japanese robotics firm has ignored the agreement, producing humanoid robots called ""hollow children"" that are able to imitate humans and assimilate their way into human society.

You take on the role of a mercenary named Dan Marshall, who is assigned by the International Technology Robot Agency (ITRA) to lead an interchangeable group of mercs to infiltrate and investigate the Amada Corporation, and ultimately destroy the illegal bots.  The game has parallels to many popular films like ""I, Robot' and ""Bladerunner"" and does a nice job of pacing its story.  While the plot isn't overly complex there's a nice back-story that plays out with a few twists tossed in for good measure.  The various characters you command each have their own unique personalities even if they are stock characters straight out of central casting with various cultural stereotypes.  Still, you're more likely to choose which two mates you take along on missions based more on their colorful personalities than you are their fighting skills.

If you're played other squad-based shooters you'll find yourself right at home with Binary Domain's precision controls and the well-defined combat system.  Naturally you will carry the weight of the battle but your squad mates hold their own better than average and will even heal you when you're hurt.  You can issue your basic commands such as ""follow"", ""Cover"", ""Charge"", etc...however the really cool function is that Binary Domain can recognize a good-size amount of voice commands if you utilize a headset.  These can take the form of all the standard commands but you can also supply encouragement to your team and give them a pat on the back by saying ""Nice work"", or you can even ream them out a bit as the system will recognize a handful of choice four-letter words.  The voice recognition works (most of the time).  There's even the ability to train certain words and phrases as well as being able to reduce ambient noise.  Still the best bet if you're going to use a headset and voice commands is pretty much turn off anything else and play it without a lot of other people around.  Or at least tell them to shut up!

There's also a trust system that the game incorporates between you and your men.  Take care of them, treat them well, and they will perform better in battle and obey your orders.  Things like friendly fire, or arguing with them can lead them to not be as helpful or responsive in battle.  But while this is an interesting element ultimately it proves fairly useless.  Unless you make it a point to being a total jerk to your men, you won't have an issue.  Mass Effect 3 it is not when it comes to decision making.

The combat in Binary domain really shines as there's a great variety of robots to kill.  But what makes the combat truly standout is the robot damage.  These are not like most organic enemies that just fall down and die but you literally can blow these bots to pieces.  You can blast off their armor or limbs and they will still pursue you like undead zombies, crawling or hopping along towards you.  I can't tell you just how cool the destruction is in this game.  You can even take control of some of the bots and use their firepower against them.  The fantastic combat and robot designs more than makes up for ordinary levels and scenery.

The campaign game runs bout 10 hours in length and there are both multi-player and co-op modes included although neither is what you would call robust.  The campaign game is definitely the meat of Binary Domain."
199520,4,This is not that bad of the game its a cross between Grand theft auto and a #rd person shooter that I cant think of at the moment I didn't buy this from amazon I got it at discount from the playstation store with all the DLC. Gameplay is a little off at times and can be frustrating when the militia forces attack in numbers with soldiers and vehicles. my biggest complaint it the cars handling its like all the cars have no brakes and the car can spin out while turning and  your on the breaks they also drive like tanks. If you can get by with the handling of the cars then it really not that bad of a game.
251122,4,"My son loves Skylanders.  But, it frustrates me that I have to buy an adventure pack to play part of a game that I already purchased."
81853,4,"I say that because you can get frustrated with how the main quest can send you on missions your to low lvl to complete. So you just go out and kill stuff until you lvl up some more. If you do that,The game wil be alot of fun to play. At lvl 13,the main quest sent me to kill 3 lvl 18 mobs and i got locked in the cave with them to boot. I died quick,so for now i'll just have fun killing stuff or try to find some side quest to do. What really makes the game stand out for me is the character/class system. You can really come up with some interesting ideas. This is a pretty good game."
460840,4,"Very good point and click adventure game with real characters, well written dialogues and story, nice puzzles and a very ""real"" feeling. From the beggining it captures your attention and you can't stop playing!"

101486,4,"Considering I came into MK with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, you can imagine how happy I was to hear that it was picked to be the first MK game on the Nintendo DS. Sure, Mortal Kombat Trilogy would've been loads better but I learned my Kombat skill with 'Ultimate'. After the atrocious Mortal Kombat Advance, I almost gave up hope on any 2-D Mortal Kombat game on a handheld. Thankfully, Midway & Other Ocean came to save the day with Ultimate Mortal Kombat.

My verdict? Well, I can certainly say it's a proper 2-D Mortal Kombat. This game doesn't suffer from the bugs(if you want to call it that) that Mortal Kombat Advance did. The speed and gameplay are almost arcade perfect. To make things even better, they threw in Puzzle Kombat (which most of you will recognize as the puzzle game included in Mortal Kombat Deception) as well as making it possible to play both games on the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

The bottom screen, if you're looking for any new innovation on how to play the game, is only used to show a moves list for your character(which is a pretty smart thing if you're not a MK vet) and to play Puzzle Kombat with your stylus...which is a bit of a downer, I know.

Mortal Kombat fans will love this trip down memory lane,I know I did, & Mortal Kombat Noobs will definitely get a history lesson."
104818,4,"I enjoyed the game, have played through twice now.  It can be a little repetitive in game action - wander around looking for objectives, fight a bunch of guys occasionally, collect the pieces of information needed to complete each assassination mission, etc.  Nonetheless, it is entertaining both in the action portion of the game play and in the story line.

One thing I liked is that even as just a casual gamer I can get through it without a tremendous amount of frustration.  The fighting techniques are relatively easy to master, so much of the mission success comes down to preparing the battlefield (taking out sentries before attempting the big assassinations).

The last boss battle is kind of weird, but the rest of the game is good.  The vistas of medieval towns are pretty impressive graphics."
31231,4,"This was my first 007 game. It's great, and just challenging enough so you can beat it and have a hard, fun time. The missing star? Two player. The levels are tiny and there aren't enough options. Nightfire hits on two-player. The one player action is unbeatable, and great graphics to boot. Great job creating a new plot and not basing it on the movie."

Sometimes, being a good girlfriend means sitting on the couch and watching him play a game or playing a game together. I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review is for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.

So, let me get the fact that this game is totally gorgeous out of the way. I mean, really, it's just beautiful. The backgrounds, the characters, the enemies and villains, even the chocobos are beautiful. But, with games as with life, looks aren't everything.

Once your team is assembled, the game pay consists of six characters with three playing at a time. (Side note: HELLO! SQUARE ENIX....I'm sitting here, I'm watching. Would it have been that hard to make those other two characters playable so I could PLAY and not just watch??) As is the case with all RPG type games, there is always at least one character that is just a tad annoying. One of the great things about this game is that it almost doesn't matter. All of your players gain experience points, no matter who you use in battle. So, you don't have to alternate players out just to try to keep everyone on equal footing level wise. For us, this meant that we hardly ever played Hope. Also, there were plenty of save points, which is great. So many games act like save points cost a fortune.

So now the negatives....
When watching a game, I like a good mix of game play and cut scenes. With this game, it seemed like it was feast or famine. Sometimes, the cut scenes seemed to last forever and happen almost too frequently. Other times, hours of game play would go on without a cut scene. Sometimes it would seem like such a long time, that I would forget what was going on. I think my occasional naps between cut scenes didn't help with my understanding of the game any. I found that at times the story was somewhat complicated, but I guess it was just me because Mike was able to follow it just fine. Of course, he was playing the game, not just watching it. (Thanks again, Square Enix. Dual player, not that hard.)

Overall, it was a beautiful and fun game with a great, albeit complicated, story. I think the ending was good, but I'm not really sure. After we beat what we assumed was the final boss, about 2 minutes into the end story...beep beep beep and the PS3 goes dead. *sigh* If you're wondering, it was NOT fun enough for us to play again, just to watch those last few cut scenes."
53690,4,"THE SHORT: Great for pick-up-and-play. Fun and addictive, interesting and strategic without going too deep. This isn't a complex war-simulator, this is a fun action/shooter.

THE LONG: I'll begin by skipping any talk of re-living Star Wars battles and how accurate the scenarios are, etc. Yes I'm a Star Wars fan, you probably are too if you're reading this, and you don't need to worry, this game gets the feel down just fine.

So how is the actual game itself?

Very fun. I played the demo on a rented copy of the SW dvds since I just wanted to see them, having bought a bootleg of the original versions on dvd. Once I played the demo, I was hooked for hours on the one level offered. Getting the full game, I played for days on end and was happy to see that some finishing touches made the gameplay better than the demo with such things as seeing enemy troops on the map and more adjustable options.

In this game, you pick from about 20 levels that range in terrain (forest of Endor, desert of Tattooine, ice planet Hoth, etc) and complexity (open levels, levels with trees and caves for cover, passageways, elevated positions, etc). You'll find several that you want to play over many times. Once you pick a level, you pick a side (Rebels or Empire for the old schoolers, or CIS robots and the Clone Troopers for the new trilogy). Sorry, no way to play the Rebels against the Clone Troopers and mixes like that, but with 4 sides to choose from in almost every battleground and 5 troop types per faction, you'll have a lot of fun messing around.

The game is greatly set up for pick up and play-style action. Once you pick your stage and side, you begin. Just pick one of your bases to spawn your soldier, and you're good to go. Walk through the stage at your discretion, fighting how you want to. Jump into a melee and back up your brothers with blaster rifle blazing, throw projectiles from afar, or do some sniping. There's nothing more satisfying in this game than watching some Imperial drones (or Rebel scum if you prefer) run past your Endor tree and then jumping out behind them and capping a few, only to run back into the safety of the foliage while your comrades engage them.

The controls are quick, easy and adjustable, and there's not much worry involved. Just have fun: When your energy bar runs out, pick a soldier again and hop back into the fray as much as you want until your side dies off or wins. Don't worry about ammo since you have a fair amound and it gets replenished with each respawning or with supply droids that you stand next to. Just fight, run, blast, die, then keep coming back and taking down as many troops as you can. But remember that you can always quietly snipe or jump into the continually respawning rides (Tauntauns, X-wings, AT-ATs) for a change of pace.

The game is engineered for strategy too. On easy you can win a lot of battles with a quick trigger finger. But go up in difficulty and you'll find that quickly overtaking the sniper towers on Kashyyk gives you a huge advantage over just storming the beach Normandy style. You can always throw on ""Instant Action Heroes"" to spice things up too, giving each side an invincible lightsaber wielding toughie to deal with. Unfortunately no, you yourself cannot play as one of the main people such as Luke or Vader or wield your own lighsaber for that matter. At first, though I knew this was clearly a game more worried about the infantry battles in Star Wars, I still wished I could play as a Jedi. But believe me, the game is just right as it is- playing as a Jedi or using a lightsaber would make you pretty much unstoppable and take out the entire strategic and competitive core that makes this game so fun. A cool unlockable perhaps, but play this game for a day and you won't miss it.

Lastly, aside from the quick play mode there's a story mode that basically follows the events of the films and lets you follow them, playing them as the series' history dictated. That's decent, as is the conquest mode which lets you try to win as many battles as you can until you conquer all of the planets, or lose and watch the opponent try to do the same to you, battle by battle. Unfortunately, these are all only slight variations on the same theme, and it never comes down to more than a different structure for participating in the same 20 battlegrounds. It's funner just to have a friend or go online for more human competition, but even without, the battles that stretch across all of the game modes are extremely fun and addicting nonetheless.

With almost no badly designed or unexciting level designs and coupled with an addictive engine and lots of ways to fight any battle, to me this game is very well made and worthy of a purchase. Non Star Wars fans can probably enjoy it on the same level as a Dynasty Warriors title or similar constant-action game as well. It's a solid title that's easy to pick up and enjoy but deep enough to keep trying new strategies and setups. The negatives are that there isn't much variation on the battle-by-battle theme, and the unlockables are worthless (game design photos, etc). But for a fun action shooter, especially one that's so easy to get into, this one's solid."
7563,4,Game is pretty cool. Makes me feel like a kid again.
393159,4,"First of all I can confirm that this is for the New 3DS XL. I don't know what was sent to the other person who said it did not work with theirs but this one works with mine. I really like this attachment. I have very large hands and it adds just enough to the 3DS XL size that is now fits more comfortably in my hands. It hooks into the top/back side of the 3DS and the bottom/front side sits nicely in while ""not"" locking into place. This is to allow for easy changing of the game carts. You just tilt the 3DS back and you have easy access to the port. For the most part this works perfectly and does not shift the handheld at all. The fit is really spot on and the 3DS does not shift at all while inserted. But I found certain playing positions to be difficult, for me it's laying on my back in bed to play. It keeps wanting to swivel front side out and I have to hold it in manually. This does not work at all for stylus play and is annoying at best if you are playing Ocarina or Majora's. I wish there was a locking mechanism or some way to lock the 3DS in to place. This would get a 5 star rating from me hands down if this feature was present. You can't beat the price and I highly recommend it.."
241037,4,"I have always been a follower of the Resident Evil franchise but I was always too afraid to actually play the game. I bought RE5 hoping to finally play it but it didn't appeal to me, plus it was too scary (IMO) But since RE6 have three different stories and characters I really wanted to suck it up and give it a try. I'm glad I did. I played with a friend so we pretty much blew through the game but it was fun the whole way through.

The first story we played was Leon and Helena. This one is by far the scariest. The atmosphere was classic Zombie horror and it was by far the best and longest of the three stories. You see each story is only five chapters and at first I was disappointed with only five but the length of Leon's story more than made up for it. You're battling zombie hordes in dark sewers and so forth and it will throw you right into the story.

The second was Chris and Piers. This is more action oriented and with good reason. The B.S.A.A. are now on an all out hunt for the B.O.Ws. So expect more of a military feel to this story. I loved slashing Chris and Piers  and the story was very touching overall. Now I'm sure some would say that it is no longer survival horror and how it is no longer the same RE game as the earlier games. However, I'm personally glad it isn't. Why? Because at this stage in the game the characters should not be taken by surprise and stumbling around like a chicken with their heads cut off. They certainly shouldn't be solving never ending puzzles just to be told that X is a bad guy. The bad guys *should* be more developed than they were in the first games. They really don't have to hide as much anymore. I'm sure that the people complaining about how much the games have changed will also be complaining about them staying the same old thing for six games if they were replaying the same old scenario over and over again.

Anyway, The Third story is Jake and Sherry, which is more of an action adventure romp and once again I'm shipping this couple cause they are just so cute together. This story is more about Jake and Sherry on the run.

Now as much as I liked this game it does have its flaws. Like, I would have liked it more if Chris and Jake's stories were as long as Leon's. I felt that it was a bit too short. I also would have liked it if Jake and Sherry had more zombie encounters than B.O.W encounters. I felt that it made more sense for Chris to have those encounters but I think the adventure aspects would have been more frightening for those two if it carried the same atmosphere as Leon's story.

I hated the low ammo and herb drops but it increased a little after buying the skill. Another thing I hated was that we were never told we had to shoot the blue emblems we saw so we passed up several of those things and only found out while playing Jake's story that we needed to shoot them. I also did not like that certain aspects of the game was designed to make you fail the first time around. For example; Sherry and Jake are riding on a motorcycle and a random truck pull in front causing you to fail the mission. If you didn't expect it to happen and dodge in time you're destined to fail on the first attempt. Also, my partner kept dying during the Chris and Piers story because I was never told that Chris was supposed to crawl over to him.

Other than that. The game was good, I loved the interweaving storyline. I loved thinking about what each character was doing while playing another story. The cinematic scenes were well done, the voice acting was top notch. I thought the hair was a bit too glossy, especially Leon and Helena. But I got over it. I loved how the cinematic collection scenes were on a timeline that pieces together each story.

I also liked Mercenaries although it would be a lot of fun as a multilayer instead of co-op or at least have a multilayer option. Agent Hunt was fun but it wears thin fast.

I'm also not interested in playing the Ada Wong campaign that gets unlocked after finishing the game. I would have liked it more if another part of Leon, Chris, and Jake was open.

I highly recommend playing the game to judge for yourself,"
197057,4,Ok.  Nothing to rave about.
454961,4,"Somewhat dated, but still runs on my Win 7 system.  Graphics are fine, game play about average.  Overall, it's satisfying and entertaining."
91837,4,"I almost missed this release amid the huge slew of first person shooters which came out recently.  While I have not hit the new episode of Half-life 2, I have played the first episode as well as Bioshock recently.  I would say this game tops those easily.

Lets start with the pro's:

1. The game was built for both XP and Vista, so none of that sad little marketing ploy of ""You need the amazing powers of Vista to play this.""  The visual difference for games such as Shadowrun and Halo 2 wasn't enough to merit an upgrade and it is good to see that this game appeals to everyone (unless you are a Mac user, not sure if it is available for that).

2. Looks absolutely amazing and runs very smooth on my machine.  I recently went through a pc upgrade for some new gaming.  Using a Core 2 Duo, 8800 GTS, and even just 2 gigs of ram, this game looked wonderful.  I haven't seen quality like this before in any game.  While Half'Life 2 did very well, Timeshift's use of focal distance, blurring effects and water reflections was amazing.

3. The control worked well in this game.  I love games where you can load it up and start playing immediately without fiddling with buttons for the next few hours.  If you have played any PC FPS before, you will fall into this easily enough.

4. Gameplay.  Odd that this is actually last on my list of Pro's, but it is the last thing I see when starting a game.  The reason I value this game over any Half-Life or Bioshock is simply the amazing gameplay.  The use of time powers to reverse, slow or stop time is incredible.  While you may play those annoying teeter-totter puzzles of Half-Life just so Valve can show off a physics engine, the added dimension of time gives this game a complete edge over the competition.
While these powers did make combat interesting, I didn't feel that they unbalanced the game.  Even on the normal skill level I sure died enough times to prove that.

And the con's:

1. I had a score of rather nasty crashes when I tried to play with the game settings.  I use on board sound in my machine, which usually sounds like total garbage in any game.  I went into the sound settings to attempt to turn down the default quality, and locked up my computer.  After resetting and starting the game once again, ALL of the default configs were gone.  Sound, Video, Control, everything was wiped and would not restore.
Attempting to manually fix everything caused one of the worst error messages I had ever seen.  How often does a game dump you into a debug screen full of what looked like assembly code?
I did a reinstall and never touched the settings again, game worked well after that but I was too scared to try and fix my sound or play with my video modes after that.

2. I felt a distinct lack of plot details when I started into this game.  You pick up bit and pieces as you go along (Much like the tape recorders in Bioshock) but I miss the days where you started at the beginning of the story and followed it along.  Having to read a plot summary later to fill in gaps isn't my idea of a very deep gaming experience.

Overall, I loved this game.  I never touched the multiplayer aspect of it, but I would assume that since you wander around and shoot things in both modes, the multiplayer works well.  From what I have read, the use of time powers makes an interesting experience.

If possible I would give this game 4.5 stars due to the lack of an engrossing storyline as well as my crash issue.  But then again, most gamers would shell out the 15 bucks and buy a decent card to avoid this issue altogether."

92907,4,"Iv just bought and Downloaded Half Life 2...I can say its amazing the graphics are wonderful and everything is very realistic.

Pros : Beautiful Graphics
  Realistic Blood and Gun Damages (Bullet Holes in Body etc.)
  No Lagging (Unless your going through a checkpoint *for me*)
  Riveting Storyline and Fun and Funny Characters (Lamar lmfao)
  *you'll see*
  A Wide Variety of Enemies to fight
  Mostly Intelligent Enemy AI (Some of the Combine are Dumb but don't let that bother you because other Combine are smart as well)
  Vehicles are fun to mess around with
  You can throw Objects at people and pick them up and carry stuff around like Boxes and Bottles *Throw some at the combine lmfao its funny*)

CONs : BUM BUM BUM BUM BUMMMMMMM!!!!!
  Slow Loading Time *This is for my computer but iv experienced some slow loading time for checkpoints which usually take 20 seconds to load and the Main Menu takes 1 minute but...I don't let it bother me the gameplay is worth the slow loading*
  Combine don't like to hide *Some of the combine won't duck or take cover..but don't worry about that if you play it on hard..it won't really matter cause you will have a time with them in the open anyway. if you play on normal its just the same but don't worry id say if you have 6 combine usually 4 will hide....at least 3 if they have some cover to actually hide behind.*

But that's all the cons....overall this game is wonderfully made beautifully written and a blast to play....If you don't buy this game. You my friend are just missing out im sorry but its the truth

But for those who are going to buy it ROCK ON MAN and Good Luck!

129552,4,"Resistance : Fall Of Man gave PS3 players their own proprietary FPS, and Resistance 2 improves upon it in pretty much every significant way

THE GOOD : There's a lot to like about Resistance 2, but one of the first things you notice right away is the marked improvement in graphics from the previous title. Resistance : FOM was a very good game and had fairly good graphics. But from the first moment you crawl from the wreckage of your downed craft and see the towering alien vessel before you, you know the second installment in this series is a marked improvement over the first. The scenery, weapons, Chimera, and additional characters all have a significantly improved look to them. The scenery is lush and vibrant compared to the first games stark and, at times drab, scenery. I seem to remember a lot of Resistance : FOM being very grey and brown for some reason. Not so with Resistance 2. The beautiful scenery makes for a harsh contrast against the games' violent and unrelenting invaders, which serves this title well. Though there are MANY scenes and levels that serve as a good example of this, none is more striking than when you first come up to street level and walk out into the open to see San Francisco burning in the distance, with the Golden Gate bridge next to you and an entire armada of invading Chimeran ships hovering above the destroyed city. You can't help but stop and admire the frightening beauty of it for a few moments as you pan the camera around to take in the full scope and magnitude of the devastation before you. In addition to the improved graphics the game ups the ante with some of the new Chimera you face. Back again are the same foot soldiers, Steelheads, Ravagers and Titans, but they've brought some new foes in the Chameleons, Furies, Grimms and most noticeably the bosses themselves. They range in size from 2-story Marauders to skyscraper-high Leviathans. And they're ALL fascinating to behold. Like the Chimera, many of the same weapons return from the original but there are new weapons to use as well. And all of them are fun and powerful. Even a simple, small gun like the Magnum is made fun to use by the secondary fire function that all the weapons in the game have. All in all this is a very fun, very good looking FPS that will provide many fun hours of entertainment...... for at least the first play-through or two. Which brings me to .....

THE BAD: While this game has much to like about it, and the positives far outweigh the negatives, there are definitely some weak points in Resistance 2. Not the least of which is, after you've played this game once through, it loses a significant bit of its' appeal. That is to say, outside of the online modes or co-op, this game has very low replay value. By the second time through, I was pretty much ready to be done with the game and move on. And not because it's a bad or boring game - not at all- it's just because once you've played this through, you know what to expect and where to expect it and how to formulate a battle strategy for it. IE, the enjoyability of this game relies a great bit on the element of surprise. Not even changing the difficulty level varies it up significantly enough to make a significant difference. Something else I was less than thrilled about (and I realize this is purely personal) is that some of the PS3 Trophies for this game are online or co-op trophies. While I realize that online play is fantastic fun, I also don't like having to rely on others to achieve the trophies I'm after. Besides, not everybody plays online either. Even a game like Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2, which is THE go-to game for online FPS play, understands this and all of the trophies are 'offline' trophies. Again, it's a personal gripe, but IMHO, a valid one. One last gripe about the trophies is that there is one trophy which requires you to get 10,000 kills in online matches. 10,000!!! Whew! That trophy alone will take longer than all the others...... combined! I know that complaints about PS3 trophies are minor, but at the same time they're a part of the game and to some, a significant part. Other than the 2 basic things I've already gone through, there isn't much else not to like, other than maybe the game gets a tad glitchy at times or freezes up altogether for a few seconds. Besides that, the plot is paper thin and not engaging at all, but who plays games like this for the literary value? As one last item of interest here, the game is painfully linear, in that it doesn't allow for too much exploration. I realize this is a mechanism to keep you moving forward and on the right path, but it's at times inconsistent.

THE BOTTOM LINE : All in all, this is a pretty solid game. If you have a PS3 and are into FPS's, especially with a sci-fi twist, this is a fantastic game. It's worth buying if you're into online play and if not, it's maybe only worth renting, depending on your preferences, because, as I mentioned the single-player campaign has moderately low replay value."
183114,4,"Good product, except for the cable joining the pedal to the rest which pretty soon became frayed and a I had to have repaired."
51288,4,"Finally, the most anticipated game of the year has arrived, Syberia 2. Syberia 1 was a great game overall, I rated it with 4 stars on Amazon. Pro's were the artwork, atmosphere and storyline, cons where the relative easy puzzles and the absence of a true 3D gaming experience.
When it comes to Syberia 2, it has much of the same pro's and cons, but slightly different. The puzzles in Syberia 2 are a bit harder (you can get stuck at times, there was no such thing in Syberia 1) so that's an improvement. However, the story has more simplicity to it, and that's too bad.
In the graphics department Syberia 2 really excells. But then again, you can say that of almost any game nowadays. I must admit that I have lost my adversity against 2D pre-rendered backgrounds as being cheapish. Okay, it is still very nice to wander around in real 3D (try Beyond Good and Evil!), but with games like Syberia it just doesn't matter that much. Many other games (Black Mirror, Journey to the Centre of the Earth) have taken the hint from Syberia 1, and so in effect we have experienced a 2D boom - who would have thought that a couple of years ago?
What's missing out in Syberia 2 is the sense of wonder and the tristesse you felt in Syberia 1. If you have played Syberia 1, you'll recognise all the automatons immediately, so there's no big surprises to be had in that department. The characters in Syberia 2 are on the whole more gentle. I must admit I liked the sadness of the Russian crew in Syberia 1, but you won't find that much depth of story and character in this sequel. Also the architecture is more of the same, but without the intricate detailing found in the first installment.
That said, Syberia 2 is still a very, very good game. I wonder how it can be sold for just under 30 bucks, when obviously a large team or artists must have worked continiously for the last two years to make this game happen.
The puzzels are much more integrated into the game, and not all of them are inventorybased anymore, as is Syberia 1. Many of the 'closed doors' '('I can not go there' every five minutes) are gone. That's a good thing. There are no foolish puzzles (like using a cat's hair to light a fire, to be able to make some coffee, to give it to someone to get some information... You like those puzzles? Try Conspiracies).
The locales however are lacking a bit in diversity, with a lot of snow, and then some more. But, then again, snow never looked as good is it does in this game.
Do you need to play Syberia 1 before starting out in Syberia 2? No. In fact, to feel and appreciate where this game is coming from, you actually need to start out with Amerzone, Benoit Sokals first game. Then move on to Syberia, then play Syberia 2. That will make for a great gaming experience, and you'll feel like reading a great trilogy.
I will be interesting to see how Syberia 2 holds out against new offerings that are coming our way soon, such as Forever Worlds, Aura and Atlantis 4. I'm confident that Syberia 2 will stay on top of the list this year."
493922,4,"This game isn't the .worst thing I have ever played but it was far from the best, I still got this game brand new for less than 10 bucks though"
73869,4,"BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS PLUGGED IN! EVEN WHEN YOU TURN THE CONSOLE OFF, THE 360 CHARGES THE BATTERY PACK.  IT WILL CONTINUE TO UNTIL YOU TURN ON AND OFF YOUR CONOLE WITH THE CHARGE KIT OUT.  IF YOU DON'T, YOUR 360 WILL OVERHEAT FROM BEING ON SO LONG AND HAVING TO POWER YOUR BATTERY PACK.

Now to the acutal review:

The charge kit is great because there is no need to constantly replace batteries.  The cord can be plugged into the xbox 360's USB port, and it has the length so that you can play it at the same time.  No need for expendable batteries anymore! The battery in the controller can recharge totally off the Xbox 360."
106437,4,"This game is really good for a sequal. They managed to improve the height restrictions, making building roller coasters more fun! Also, the graphics, music, and new things that appear in this game are great. My only complaint is the restriction on power levels."
91519,4,"This game reminds me of Silent Hill 2 in its graphic presentation and gameplay, and that's a good thing.  The sound and other assorted atmospherics are eerie and unnerving.  Movement is smooth and fluid.  The combat system is pretty easy to pick up.  The thing that's really different about this game is the ability to move back and forth between dimensions (the creepy Silent Hill and the regular Silent Hill) by touching mirrors.  If you've seen the movie (or played the other games)then this certainly adds to the back story.  If you're a survival horror fan, you can't go wrong with this title.  It's one of the better PSP games out there."
75843,4,"The original Mall Tycoon was bad but it definately wasn't as bad as ER(the PC game). Spinning 2 sequels you would think like 18 Wheels of Steel, the game would be more polished, better graphics and not as frustrating. Everytime I play whether a sandbox mode or a scenario, I always seem to run out of money and stores closes due to not making enough money. I would like freedom to build any size store and highlight a box that my store can go to. It would be nice to make anchor stores (the large department stores that take more than 2-3 floors). The department stores in MT3 is a huge box/rectangle with more than one type of good being sold. Very disapointing. Also when you want to make a second floor, its very frustrating when you try to go one way, and all of a sudden you whole 2nd floor is made following the track of the 1st floor. Some malls have intricate 2nd floors highlighted with a box here and a rectangle there with a elaborate food court along with a Multiplex. It's time to update the graphics, take away the cartoonish style and create a tycoon game that is unique, fun to play, and  allows freedom. It gets boring when you place billboards, benches, vending machines and all of them blink because they need repairs. The repairmen and the janitors need better pathfinding. Building parking lots and garages would be a nice feature especially when you see cars pull into parking spots and the multi-level garage. The addition of security cameras outside and inside would add good value as well as a security office. Nowadays malls have resturants and roads (with  or without traffic lights) that seperate the parking fields.
  All in all, I like this game but it doesnt have enough to keep me occupied. It's already deleted from my system and I hope #4 comes out and is impressive. Basically your in charge of building a mall with different types of flooring, walls, stores, and more. This game is so much better than Mall of America."
81014,4,"So, I felt I should do a review on this product. Here we go.

Sound - 5:
The sound is amazing. Even better than the console version! I- I- can't describe it. Just watch a 'Let's Play' video and you'll understand.

Graphics - 4:
Yeah, they're pretty good. Not very easy to describe, though.

Characters - 5:
It seems that this game took out all the boring and pointless characters and replaced them with a few cooler ones. In the console game, no one cared about Imperial Spy or Sandtrooper. Though they don't have some of the cooler characters like the 'Ghost' characters or Beach Trooper, they have MSE-6 (Mouse Droid) and Baby Rancor!

Difficulty - 3:
The levels themselves took me a day to beat, but I am still working on the secrets. Does anyone know where the Minikits are in Endor Battle and Trench Run???

249042,4,The graphics are really nice and the 3d is better than expected with a very nice but short storyline but the reason I don't give it a 5 star is because you can't transfer your pokemon from previous games. In order to do so you have to pay for pokemon bank which the application is free but you have to pay a $5 USD monthly and by downloading pokemon bank app it enables you to download pokemon transfer. Which is the app that transfers pokemon from black and white and etc to pokemon bank then you can withdraw your pokemon from pokemon bank to but into your pokemon x and y.

4433,5,"This is a good game to get into if you've got some time on your hands. It's definitely addicting, but it's not the type of addicting like where it's boring as hell but you want to keep playing to unlock secrets and whatnot. It gets more challenging as you play, and doesn't slow down. You're constantly moving and keeping the park clean as well as the rides moving smoothly. You're keeping your patrons from [getting sick]... and keeping them from leaving the park, and want them to spend as much money as they have in your park.
You can design your own rollercoasters, water rides, go kart rides, etc. It's a great game to get into, but just be aware that you'll want to keep playing once you've started."

212742,5,"Hidden inside an amusing little story, decent graphics, and hours of fun is a real brain workout. Basically, you work your was through a series of rooms where certain objectives have to be met to open the exit and proceed to the next room.

You have a portal gun which creates an opening in a wall, floor, etc. and then a second portal creates an exit from the first. Say you are in a square room. You put a portal opening on the wall in front of you. Then put the second on the wall to your right. Walk in one and you exit the other. Move one to the ceiling and walk in one and fall out of the one in the ceiling.. Put one in the floor, fall through and you walk out of the wall. You can only generate two portals.

Add machine gun turrets, laser light walkways, refractive/reflective cubes to direct laser beams, liquids that make you bounce or run fast, create surfaces on which you can place a portal opening, while working your way through an ever increasing complex rooms and you have Portal 2 (and the original Portal).

It is a great mental workout! I have it on PC and a neighbor's son was over playing it and he's pretty sharp anyway. I was amazed at how quickly he solved the puzzles to get through the rooms so I got him a copy for his PS3. I figure now, while in high school, what better time to help hone his problem solving skills!"

70751,5,"I just got my ds for christmas and i wanted to know which games were the best for the ds. So i picked up mario kart and mario 64 and they were both great games, then i post on gamespot.com's forums which game i should get next. they keep telling me animal crossing. I haven't played the gamecube version at all. So i eventually bought it (it took me a couple of weeks because it was all sold out everywhere). A couple of minutes into the game, it was very fun. It surprised me how good it was.

Graphics 5/5 These have to be one of the best games from a graphical standpoint of view. They are realistic, but there cartoony which i kind of like.

Controls 5/5 There are two sets of controls use the stylus or use the d pad with the a,b,x,y buttons. I perfer the stylus. its really easy to get into.

Sound 5/5 the sound is excellent in the game. From the crushing of the snow to the calm sound of the ocean. If you are annoyed by the animal talk that they have or the music that i don't mind, you can just simply turn down your volume.

Fun 5/5 As we all know the original animal crossing from what ive heard is very addicting. Its the same concept here. Its pretty much the exact same game from the gc version and the same storyline. You are a human sent to this animal town. you work for this guy nook cranny that builds you a house and you have to pay the morgage. Along the way you met new animal friends and you can fish, catch bugs, and dig fossils, and upgrade your hous. Eventually you do run out of things to do everyday so you are only going to play this game 1-2 hours a day at the most. The best feature about this game is the wifi. Its pretty fun, you can visit your friends house or your friend can visit yours. You can have up to 4 ppl in one town. Animal Crossing for the Ds is a really good game. I reccommend you buy it for any DS user."

362587,5,We love our PS4. It works great even after two years of constant use. My husband loves the white color as compared to the traditional black.

119687,5,"When you ask someone what is the best sequel of all time they'll say either Godfather part 2 or The Empire Strikes Back. Back in 2006 a game came along that was so unique so original that it drew world wide aclaim and a boatload of fans. That game was Cooking Mamma and now we as DS owners have our own Godfather 2 or Empire with Cooking Mamma 2 Dinner with Friends.

This is the best video game sequel I have played since I first got my DS this and the orginal have endless replay value even after you've unlocked all the recipies.

The gameplay is the same as the first which is performing kitchen tasks with a time limit to complete a dish. Yet the people at Office Create have added a few twists. For one you can unlock new outfits for mamma and can control how her kitchen looks. Then there are her friends. Mamma's friends are picky, mess up just one time on one of their recipes and you tick them off(My heart breaks every time I see David cry).

I pre ordered Gardening Mamma, the spin off to this series, and it looks as good as the first two Hopefully they make a third one for this console.

If you like this game I would also recomend My Pet Shop, a game that is a cross between nintendogs and cooking mama.

Enjoy"

97807,5,"NBA Street Homcourts been around a while now, and its a good game to play over and over. NBA street series have always been one of my favorite sport franchises and Homecourt is no different. I bought this game back in March with no hesitation and never regreted it. The game is a lot of fun like past NBA Street games, but this one is a lil different from the rest. NBA street has always been famous for its cool smooth AND 1 type tricks like Back 2 Papa and all dat but this game takes it to another level, its not exactly a good thing but its a nice new thing that EA is trying, there is something called a TRICK REMIXER which changes the tricks a lot easier from holding the shoulder buttons and tapping square to only two buttons (The Square button and the Triangle Button). The graphics are of course the best right now and character models of NBA stars are better than ever. There are a bunch of new things like double dunks which are crazy and a lot of fun to do, the new gamebreaker which is a little bit harder to pull off than the Past NBA Street games but satisfying when you do. The thing that disspoited me was the lack of customization whcih was one of my favorite things that were added back to NBA Street V3, the customization is a lot more linear here with putting on only Jordan wear from shoes to tops all Jordan and nothing else. Its not very fun anymore to create a character. The new story mode for your custom character is very good, following the old formula, starting as a newb to becoming a local street legend, with RPG type elements like leveling up your skills and of course your character getting a personal Nickname. The Game has a retro type feel to ot from the music to the narrator and style of te game. There is online mode but not that many people play it (trust me). NBA Street Homecourt is a very fun game with cool moves, cool music and fun gamplay, altough not the best its a very very fun and great game that you should buy especially of you have a Playstation 3 like me"
213819,5,I'm really happy I bought this used.  I've had it for a while now and haven't had a single issue.  When it arrived it was as if getting a brand new console...  Except the box was open.  I would do it again.

179256,5,"This is a great match three game for people like me who are pretty good but not geniuses.  Games did finally get pretty hard for me but it gives you the option to skip them which I think is great.  I have 2 or 3 match three games I'm stuck in and can't go any further.  One of them is really kind of early on.  I think that's ridiculous--especially since I paid for it.  And also since I really am pretty good.  Games should be enjoyable for everyone or there should be a disclaimer.  Meanwhile, Big Kahuna Reef is a lot of fun and can't complain about the price."
435845,5,"This is by far the best keyboard I have ever used on a computer. The mechanical keyboard, with superb feel on the keys, is super responsive and so comfortable on your fingers. You will instantly know the difference.  It's a solid, heavy piece of machinery.  This is a mix of ""No Nonsense"" design with cool modern workings.  The lights are absolutely a great thing.  Can make you crazy or just turn it off...But they are fun.  Download the app to install the keyboard and play with it and then play away. Comes with the thickest, most solid USB cord ever, with a pass through port to attach headphones or speakers.  It's not wireless, but the cord reaches a decent length, enough for me to still sit on the couch and game away.  This is a superb mechanical keyboard, the feel, the response, the features, all combine to make this one of the best keyboards you can get."

175485,5,"My husband bought this game and I was initially not interested as he described it as an arcade game cross between pinball and pachinko. He kept trying to get me to play it, talking about what great fun it was but I continued to tell him I wasn't interested in a ""boring"" arcade type game.

However, the whole time he was having a great time with it, and then my 5 year old daughter began playing it as well. They were both so obsessed with it that I decided to ""sneak"" a play while they were out, just to see...

2 hours later I was still playing it and they came in and caught me. So after all my stubborn refusals to play the game there I was, just as obsessed with it as they were!

This game is great for those times when you want to play something that doesn't require a lot of deep thinking or over analysis. You CAN play it with deep analysis, determining what angles will get you the most pegs, etc. However, it is not at all required to play, have fun, and progress in this game. Essentially there is a tube at the top of the screen that your ball comes out of. The ball is super bouncy and reminds me of the bounce patterns found with a ping-pong ball. You aim the tube with the goal of hitting all the red pegs. The goal is to eliminate all the red pegs before you run out of balls. Once you eliminate the pegs you move to the next level and so on.

The premise is simple yet there are many variations set up on each level to mix it up and keep it different. You also gain points, but initially your points aren't all that valuable. However, once you complete all the standard levels and reach the ""challenge"" stage, you will then need to eliminate all the red pegs while also obtaining a minimum number of points. (However, that is not until much later in the game) This is the level I'm currently at, so I can't say what happens from here.

This is a great, super fun game for those 5 years old on up."
168579,5,"As a great lover of Greek Mythology, I think this game really captures everything. The graphics are great, the storyline for each culture is well thought out, and the actual cultures blow me away. Each culture (Egyptian, Greek, and Norse) all include there main gods, and each come with special powers that either benefit your culture or wreck havoc on your enemies. Also, each god you choose to worship comes with a mythical beast, ranging from sphinxes to harpies, and even to ice and fire giants. In addition, the gods seem to have an odd sense of humor, making you wonder if you should laugh or cry.
Another quality of the game is that, if you don't like the story mode, you can play a game against between 1 to 4 computer players.
Buy this game, and you won't regret it!"
340513,5,"This game was so good, I was compelled to go for the platinum trophy on PSN. It was the first time I liked a game that much. It's extremely good."
69944,5,"The game came completely new (Still wrapped in factory paper, instruction booklet and everything) and looks amazing! Works well on my PS2, and am having a blast with it.

I am satisfied with the purchase at a good price."
190619,5,"if you buy the game, unlock all the weapons and perks and still don't like this game, thats one thing. but people need to stop giving this bad reviews because they don't allow hacking or they don't allow you to kick players that are too good or too bad etc.  I hated world at war because it seemed like every match was private.  when i found a match i got kicked because i was too good.  Not to mention people hacking and pirating the game.  Hopefully more pc games do this because pc gamers are never happy and always complaining."
238874,5,"Finally the Vita delivers a game that lives up to the Vita potential, the game has great graphics and terrific gameplay. This is without a doubt the best game so far on the vita."
64543,5,"its been a while but i finally bought this gamne and it is perfect, its violent and bloody, with mass killings that you can do at the tap of a button, there is nude pictures in the game too, in the 2.0 version. just gotta explore, so for all you parents and childish adults, who think sex is a bad thing, i wonder how you came to exsistance, i bet you all watch porn, but its not o.k for a video game marked with a mature rating to be played..you people make me sick, worry about the war in iraq, violence is 24-7 over there and worry about the streets cause violence is everywhere, and nothing is being done to fix it, like a video game will make me get up , go outside and start punching cops, or crashing my car into a crowd of people...GROW UP YOU SILLY IDIOTS, STOP BLAMING THE GAME AND START BLAMING YOUR SELFS, THE GAME DOESNT RASE YOUR CHILD....YOU DO!!!

but over all this game is flawless!! and"
420129,5,"Bought the code, got the code, redeemed the code on my Xbox One Elite, game immediately began to download. I have a decent internet connection, so it didn't take long. There was a quick update afterwards, and then I was good to go! Smooth experience there.

The Campaign:
A lot of people have slammed the campaign for being too short and what not, but honestly it feels par for the course for a Halo game. I thought it was fairly satisfying, but then again I bought it primarily for the multiplayer! I used the campaign to help me adjust to new controls (especially since I have the elite controller, and the paddles took some getting used to). I also haven't been overly impressed with halo campaign since the first one, but again, that's most likely due to my emphasis on multiplayer, so take all I say here with a grain of salt. Campaign is fine in my book :D

Multiplayer - Warzone:
I honestly haven't spent too much time here. It is a really cool idea, and seems implemented well as far as I've played it. This is the main place where micro-transactions (req. packs) come into play.

Multiplayer - Arena:
This is where I'm at. I loved Halo multiplayer from CE through Halo 3. It was awesome! Everything so balanced, so...""halo"" (you know what I mean). Then there came Halo 4. I was SO excited for Halo 4, and pre-ordered it and the whole she-bang. Unfortunately, it felt like a slightly more polished Halo: Reach. The armor abilities and load-outs really put me off. I also remember poor level designs and a weird campaign, but honestly, I put Halo 4 down before too long. I would occasionally pick it back up for nostalgia's sake thinking ""hey I love Halo, and I have the newest Halo, I should like this!"" but I didn't so much, but I digress. Halo 5 is so much like the original three Halo games in terms of multiplayer, that I just stinking love it! For some reason I was absolutely terrible right out of the gate. Probably more because I was fiddling with elite controller stuff, but now that I have it down, I'm thoroughly enjoying myself! No more Call of Duty-esq loadouts, everyone is back to even-starts. These elements are, IMO, part of what makes Halo, Halo. Movement is fluid, the game looks great, guns sound more awesome than before, the maps are great, and the competition is pretty fierce. I haven't even played all of the arena game types (mainly SWAT and Team Slayer) but its everything I ever wanted lol. I got Black Ops III and Halo 5 the same day, and so far Halo has all my attention!

As of a few days ago, the big team battle lists are already out, so that complaint is out the window too. I never even had the game while it was missing, but I doubt I would've noticed it for a while, considering warzone and all.

Multiplayer - Microtransactions:
To everyone who is hating on the game for this, I don't think you've actually played the game. It only effects the gameplay of the warzone playlist, and even then not much (though again I haven't played a ton of it). Without any req packs I was able to get myself some new weapons and a tank through the req system. After playing a little bit over the course of a week, I was able to unlock three of the Gold req packs which are the highest tier. They are still fun to open, even if you don't use them for much. You can get armor customization as well weapon/vehicle/powerups. But there is really no advantage to buying with real money vs using in game currency.

At the end of they day, I am so glad they implemented this, because it means they aren't charging for map packs!!! This is great news! Look at the season pass for Black Ops 3: $50, Battlefront: $50, Fallout 4: $30, at the end of the day you are saving a ton of money by this system existing. And what does it cost you? Nothing. No, it doesn't even cost you a disadvantage in warzone. Calm down, everything is fine ;) enjoy your free DLC!

What I'm looking forward to: I hope for some of the sillier game types like action sack, zombies, and whatever else they can come up with. Those are especially fun when taking a break from ranked matches, or when you don't feel like taking things as seriously.

What I don't like: So far, I do still miss the local coop capabilities. I am crossing my fingers for a patch that lets you do it offline, but it isn't so big a deal as it once would've been. We'll see though! They have certainly fulfilled their promises (in my book) as far as multiplayer prowess goes."
241013,5,"These are the types of games that are great for all ages.  Fun gameplay.  Rated E for everyone.  If you're looking to give a gift for younger kids and have no idea about gaming, this series is always a good way to go.  This collection is a steal for the amount of fun to be had blasting through levels.  Very rarely does the R&C series disappoint.  All games in the MAIN series have been great.  There are a few titles that were kind of like side games...for example R&C All-4-One....those kind of suck.  I would avoid those."
378191,5,Awesome. Kids love it
336597,5,These are amazing for the xbox one. The perfect level of grip and comfort I was looking for. I had seen reviews claiming that they would snag the edge but that was not the case for me. These also fit perfectly over Kontrol Freeks. I will use these forever.
331942,5,Love that we can watch TV while a child plays a game on the controller screen with headphones. Best feature and missing from other consoles.
248420,5,There are not enough words to describe the amazingness of this game... It gave much needed freshness to the Pokmon series
158525,5,I purchased my PS1 Dualshock controllers in july 2001 and it still works 2 dis day-talk about longevity! I had a emerald colored ps dualshock controller and it ceased workin within a year. The diffrence between the original ps dualshock controllers and it's ps1 successor's lies in it's motor sizes. Whereas the original had 2 large motors the latter had a large and small motor-which n my opinion provided a lessen vibration feel than the original. Nonetheless this controller is a must have 4 ps1 dualshock supported games.
172385,5,"Granted, this is my first flight stick, but the price was right and the response is very spot on. Works great on Windows 7 with Steam FSX, and has sufficient weight and grip to prevent slipping. If you are attempting to control the game strictly based on the mouse and keyboard, even this low priced accessory will add a higher value of experience."
458224,5,good condition disk i though of this been an adventure game but it has too many bosses  and is only shooting
151155,5,"He LOVES this! Plays it just about every day. My husband and I play it with him sometimes too and it's pretty good. Disc came without scratches, plays awesome, case was in excellent condition, cover art great. All around a good buy, definitely worth the money."
37465,5,This controller is very nice and probably the best. It works with big and small hands it feals non greasy(unless you have greasy hands) it has a nice vibration if you notice on some of the other controllers the vibration is too big. Now I own a PlayStation 2 and i have played with a lot of other controllers but they don't last the buttons get pushed in the analog is too sensitive etc. Although with this controler ive had it for 2 years and it has yet to break on me and people this is a sensitive object don't slam it it will work well as long as you take care of it. Also the button reaction on this is the quickest I have seen with those big bulky ones the reaction is very bad and sometimes the analogs don't work properly. You may have also seen this controller in black and teal there all the same price and all have the same durability the only differene is the color. I rate this item 5 stars because its the best controller out there.
311232,5,"This is a great game- but you should know it's only online multiplayer.

It's highly accessible and WAY more fun than Call of Duty games for those of us who don't want to spend hours practicing the latest glitches and exploits or learning the maps for sniper points. Titanfall multiplayer is very forgiving, and I would encourage you to check it out if you have a distaste multiplayer games because of the general tenor of multiplayer gaming. You can just sit down and plan and have a great time without worrying about being not good enough or out of practice.

The game still has enough depth to get 30 or more hours out of it without feeling like you have maxed out."
394861,5,Super fun and highly addictive. I found it nice to as interactive as it is. Lego video games are fun but this takes them to a whole new level. Definitely a must buy for Lego fans who will enjoy rebuilding their Lego vehicles and tools.
263190,5,"Game is wonderful if you didn't get the chance to play them on the PS2 at the time of their releases.
Highly recommend."
394007,5,Fits in the NEW 3DS perfectly.
60292,5,"I just got this and love it. Final Fantasy XI is frustrating at best with a keyboard, this gamepad makes it sooo much more workable. Everything I need is a button or thumbstick push away (though more complex actions require multiple steps in the menus, but that's to be expected anyways). I really like the wireless feature as well, since my computer setup isn't standard (I'm known to have PCs on the floor or set up at weird locations compared to the monitor or where I sit)."
206642,5,excellent product reached me in time
465344,5,great price
350961,5,The best game I played in over 20 years! NES Zelda is still my all -time favorite but this is a close second! LOVE IT!
3136,5,cool
320348,5,"I couldn't complain about this even if I wanted to, arrived way earlier than I thought it would and everything was packed nicely and there was no damage. The console itself is perfect and I am more than pleased to have bought it."
337700,5,"I got the GAME ONE to replace my beloved PC360 headset, which suffered from the common volume knob deterioration / sound cutout problem. The GAME ONE is very similar to the PC360 in performance: about the same sound quality (very good for a headset, as opposed to real headphones) and mic quality (really great). The GAME ONE is better than the PC360 in build quality - it feels more solid, and things slide and click into place more smoothly with a more satisfying feel.  Overall, I think this is the best PC gaming headset available. Comfortable, good sound, great ergonomics.

For purposes of comparison, I'll note that I have quite a few good mid-fi headphones, ranging from Q701s to HD650s to Fidelio X2. I also have a a ModMic and a V-Moda boom mic. I use the GAME ONE almost to the exclusion of all of these. The sound quality is a bit short of my best headphones: not as good positioning as the Q701s; not as good ""immersion"" as the 650s; etc. However, the GAME ONE is very good in each of these departments, and the mic quality is considerably better than the ModMic or V-Moda. Where the GAME ONE really excels is in ease of use / ergonomics. It's just really nice to not have to fiddle with multiple wires, not having to use an amp, having the swing up to mute function on the mic boom, and having the volume control on the earcup."
346230,5,"This game is AMAZING and gives complete closure to the series.  I have to say that this is my absolute favorite rendition of the Castlevania franchise.  Mercury Steam hit the nail on the head with the series.  I love the graphics, environment details, music...all aspects of the game.  I don't normally give my opinion on games but this one and the other two are worth mentioning at least a few things.  I'll probably wait a year or two and play through all three games again.  That's how much I love them."
138245,5,"I used to be a huge Grand Theft Auto fan, and I like Saints Row even more than GTA, I think this game is freaking awesome!! I like GTA 4, but as far as Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA 3, I would play Saints Row anyday, over them!!"
458332,5,"Product is as stated, great, fast delivery."
76676,5,I could definately tell a difference in the picture quality.  It also sounded great on my surround sound.  It was worth the money.
244945,5,"Back in the 70's I saw the movie Jaws in 3D (yes, there was movie with that title even though most people don't even remember it and it had little to do with the classic). The movie stunk but i remember being facscinated by the 3D effects when they were there; seing objects ""float"" over the head of the person in front of me.  I had heard about the 3D movies back in the 50's (before my time) and seen pictures of people in theaters wearing the glasses.  For those that did see one of those old 3D movies I've heard that they didn't even begin to compare with todays 3D. The most I could gather was that the 3D movies from that early time never really took off for that reason.  Personally Im impressed with the Sony 3D display and the 3D games avail today. I find the 3D effect to be much more ""practical"" with games. There seems to be a lot of yay and nay sayers when it comes to the 3D effect. I fail to see how anyone could fail to be impressed with this Sony unit and a well made 3D game (or movie for that matter).  If you are in the market for a computer monitor at the same time this unit also makes a large computer monitor.  I was in the market for a new computer monitor at the time and this absorbed some of the price of that. I am not suggesting that someone buy this just as a pc monitor but if you are looking for both.............To listen to some 3D will have a short life but I think it will be here for a while and if I thought that it was going to dissapear shortly I would simply scarf up every 3D game/movie I could get my hands on at the time and put them away.  Im sure Amazon would appreciate it! All kidding aside I really like this unit. The fact that it doubles as a big computer monitor was the final selling factor as I was in the market for such at the time.  The sound quality even though nothing to write home about is better than most monitors I've heard. The 3D glasses have a ""sack"" to keep them in and scratch free.  If you want 3D you cant go wrong with this unit.  If you have not seen 3D I suggest you get a look at it. If you don't care for it you can forget about this unit but if you do like it I suggest that you may want to invest in this 3D display."
228900,5,"It is totally worth it!! You get a chat headset with a extremely long cord. It also comes with two long USB cords for the controllers. (one is black and the other blue.) It also comes with an HDMI cord a charging dock (with power adapter) that can charge PlayStation move controllers two standard controllers, and two USB ports on the back that is also used for charging. It also comes in it's own packaging which is also a plus."
151975,5,good to have
449262,5,"This is another Trek game I have had for many years, in fact, it was the first Trek game I ever played back in the early 90's. This is another must have for fans of this series. It is third person as you control all of your favorite characters as you take a group of four, including you, down to planets and different ships to rescue people and investigate mysteries. You also have to fight Ferengi/Romulan and other alien ships on occasion aboard the Enterprise. There are three ways you can lose on the game

1. If your ship is destroyed during a battle with another ship
2. All of your crewmen die
3. If Picard is killed, if he dies and the rest of the crew is fine, you still lose. So I recommend to not use Picard until it's your last resort or if you know it is safe for him to beam down.

The game plays like an RPG, because you choose your dialogue of how to respond to those you talk to. A fight to the death can begin or be avoided by the things you say. The storyline is fairly interesting and plays like an episode of TNG.

The look of the game is your typical Genesis look, which isn't bad. When you are on the ship, you are on the Bridge. And may look around by pressing left and right. Here you can read the crew and alien bios. And tell Mr. Data to go to Warp to the next destination. When you are on your way to another planet while flying in Warp, you will come in contact on occasion with another ship. This is when the verbal skills I was talking about comes into play.

Like I said, overall a very fun game. But it does have a few things that make it drag. There is one level where you have to rescue the miners in a cave, looking for all of them can be time consuming and take sometimes an hour. There is another mission when you have to search a lot of Solar Systems until you find the right Ferengi ship. These two levels can become tedious and annoying, but it doesn't hurt the overall fun of the game."
384424,5,"I'd assume this is a nice amiibo, I wouldn't know because my seller attempted to scam me, but I'll rate this anyway"
419854,5,"One the best gaming experience of this generation. The Uncharted series has been part of my life for a near decade. I remember when a Gamestop employee told me you must get Uncharted for the PS3 and I was like I don't know- I don't really like Tomb Raider like that. I pre-ordered the first game because of his enthusiasm but didn't play until a year later. Man, me and my brothers spend all Christmas day playing the hell out of that game. We were screaming laughing and just having a blast.

The second Uncharted game came and again another blast and I beat it in two sittings. The third Uncharted game I waited but was extremely excited. I did not have enough money in 2011 since Portal 2, Arkham City, Skyrim had also came out that year. When I was finally ready, UC3 blew my mind away because it incorporated  my favorite movie ever, Lawrence of Arabia, and stealth gameplay MGS-lite.

UC3 was my favorite in the series. From the middle eastern music and themes and overall story arc of Sully, Nate and Elena. I have to mention my history with the series because this is the final one and if you have not played the previous installments I would not recommend playing this game. Just like Metal Gear Solid 4, this one is for the fans. The fans who love the story and care about the relationships. If you did not like any of the previous games- you probably won't like this one.

The gameplay is extremely redefined. Naughty Dog has been watching other games like MGS, Batman, new Tomb Raider and GTA 5 and blended a little bit of each one and their own special magic to create an awesome third-person action adventure.

The graphics are mind-blowing. I spend over 5 hours standing still and just appreciating the level of detail and constantly asking myself, how the hell can you make a game this beautiful?! The game keeps track of how you stand idle. Naughty Dog knew that had made a graphical masterpiece because why even keep track of that?

The story is the best in the series. No spoilers- but the writing, acting and just the pacing is perfectly done. When things are dragging a little bit something insane will show up to start up your adrenaline. The mystery and treasure Nate and the team are looking for is the best in the series because they spend quality time discussing and giving you more in depth information on what happen before and how it relates to the current situation.

Every UC has always had over-aching theme and this one is revolving around greed and the pursue of a legacy. It might sound like this has been explored before in the games but never to this extent. I cannot speak anymore on this game without spoilers. The stealth gameplay is awesome def. a big influence was Metal Gear and Batman. Not as in-depth as MGS but definitely fun and add a sense of accomplishment and stress when clearing a room without ever starting an all-out war.

Again, I would recommend playing the previous games before to fully appreciated the overall achievement of this game. The best game on the PS4 and best game so far of the generation until the next Naughty Dog game."
365107,5,"First off, I never played a Dynasty Warriors game in my life, but this game is really a great game. I know that some people said that the game is repetitive and IGN gave the game a 7.0 out of 10 because the game is repetitive and said it was too easy. But believe me, that couldn't be farther from the truth! The game starts of easy and gets much harder. If you die, you can restart from checkpoints and the game is a little repetitive, but it doesn't matter because the fun is there and gets better the more you play. The boss battles are epic and are truly fan service. They are challenging starting at the middle of the game. In the beginning it's pretty easy, but it gets more difficult the more you play.

Anyway, getting to the good stuff, the story starts out kind of boring, but keep playing, it gets pretty interesting because they tie the battles into the story and even when you're fighting, it doesn't get repetitive because there's always something new happening. Granted you're fighting the same way, but you can unlock new combos and weapons and there's always something or someone new to fight. I won't go into any details but the main villain isn't Ganon or Demise like in previous games, it's a sorceress named Cia, she's trying to take control of Hyrule and basically bring back a new enemy. It's really good in my opinion, I don't know why IGN said it wasn't, I like it. And judging by the reviews I've read, no one else has complaints that the story stinks either.

The fighting is really awesome in this game, but it's not the only thing that this game has to offer... but more on that later! The action in this game is crazy! It makes you feel like a real badass swinging around a sword and knocking 25 guys into the air, taking them all down. Then figuring out how to beat the bosses is really fun too. I haven't played every Zelda game so I don't know how to beat every boss. But fighting Demise was difficult for me, and I played Skyward Sword. The combat is with all four buttons on the front of the gamepad. X is a light attack and Y is a heavy attack. Mix those up and you can get huge combos. The B button lets you dodge attacks and the A button is your special attack. You even have a magical attack as well. Different characters have different attacks and powers and it fun to experiment and important as well, because the more you experiment, the more you discover and the easier it is to destroy opponents.

The graphics rock in this game, they are spectacular! Details from the Legend of Zelda series are everywhere, you can cut grass and destroy rocks with bombs and the textures are really well done. There is also some really deep colors and good antialiasing. I'm pretty sure the game plays in 1080p. Also, It's best if you're Wii U is hooked up to a wall outlet, because it runs the best that way!

The music is great, very similar to legend of Zelda, although it could be more reminiscent of the series. I didn't like the rock inspired Zelda-esque music. It kind of ruined it. It was fine, but not great. But most of the songs are very good, it's just some that could be better.

Now, the game modes. There are four game modes. Legend which is the story mode, free mode which is the free play mode where you can replay the story mode with any character you want. Adventure mode, which lets you navigate through a huge original The Legend of Zelda style map and start Hyrule Warriors battles. I'll explain that in a moment.  And also Challenge mode, which I haven't played but from what I hear you can play through as many stages as you can without dying and you can collect items like sword and items for crafting and things like that. But the best modes are Legend and the Adventure mode. Like I said the story mode is good. But the Adventure Mode is where it's at for me! I love navigating through the original The Legend of Zelda world and finding hidden items and uncovering treasure and it's really fun. You can search for things in the original TLoZ game by completing battles in Hyrule Warriors style battles. Then you use the items you pick up to find hidden pathways to unlock more levels for you to play. And eventually you defeat the bosses and win.

All-In-All, this is my favorite game right now and I'm probably not going to beat it for a while. This is an amazing game and I love all things Nintendo right now so I can't wait to fight Ganon in Adventure mode and win! Also, can't wait to beat the story. Plus this game is a game that almost never ends. You can keep collecting and leveling up your characters for a while and you probably still won't be done with it. It's awesome! I urge you to get this game for Wii U and if you don't have a Wii U, I urge you to get one! There are so many good games on it you just have to have one. I would recommend getting this game, Mario Kart 8, Super Mario 3d World and The Legend of Zelda: the Windwaker HD. Plus there are so many other games to get that are already out, and more are on the way. Really happy with this purchase and my Wii U purchase. Couldn't recommend more!"

37400,5,"Animal crossing is an amazing game so addictive, your family will file a missing person's report. The theory behind the game is to emulate an everyday life. Your character moves to a new town and has to earn a living, interact with the townsfolk, and more importantly design his/her digs. The time in the video game is tied to the actual clock/calendar in your Nintendo GameCube resulting in a realistic progression of things like daylight and seasons... in short if its January in real life, it's going to be snowing in the video game. and if its dark outside in real life, it will be dark in the game, so on and so forth. Animal Crossing will keep entertaining forever, simply because the game generates new scenarios and situations every single day. As a heads-up this game requires a memory card to do almost anything with, I'm not sure if Nintendo is still packaging them with the game so be prepared to have a memory card on hand. This game also takes advantage of the Gameboy Advance via the Gameboy Advance/GameCube link cable, and the Gameboy Advance E-Reader. These are all for non-game essential extras. All you NEED is the GameCube, Animal Crossing, and a Memory Card with about 60 free spots."

432182,5,"I've been playing video games for 31 years give or take
Ori and the Blind Forest is a flawless double A arcade style game

It's been a while since i played a platformer this amazing
There is nothing like this across the board in terms of a new IP

Controls: are smooth once you get in the grove it's super fun and easy to play!
It helps that the game is fun.....

Music: Phenomenal the production values on the score is on par with Disney (Great soundtrack/score) want the music it's one of the best high quality scores I've heard in years
The voice of God or whatever the voice is meant to be is just unique

Story: The story is extremely deep
Can a video game create emotions? Turn this on crank up the music and take it in
It will awake some type of emotions in you everything is constructed so well
There's a lot of story going on with Ori

If you have a Xbox One gets this it'll blow you away 10/10
Why is it none of the gaming media is pushing this game"
417760,5,"Although I love this expansion, I recognize it is also very subtle in the way it changes the gameplay.

For me, one of the best parts of this expansion is the town it comes with and the care and consideration to the architecture, people made (they have names that fit with this Dutch-esque town, and look European), and new clubs. The town is just beautiful and fun to visit.

The clubs are something that are deeper than I thought, though they are not what I would consider a reason for playing the game. It's a side-activity that has a ton of depth to it. The ability to really hone in what your club will be like is such a neat feature.

The build and buy options are top notch as well and easily expand upon the houses you can build and the features you can utilize inside buy mode. I am a sucker for the tudor style, so this was a win-win for me.

Another feature that isn't talked about as much is the invitations to go to events. Without this xpac, it was a lot easier to forget about a night life and going out to clubs and whatnot. You will be invited to dance competitions from time to time and invited to locations for some event. I never found the invites intrusive nor overwhelming either.

All in all, however, I cannot agree to purchasing this pack at full price. I did not feel that all of the above features were really worth all that money. I'm not saying it's a rip-off, just not something I would agree to pay that price for. Creating a town that beautifully done and all the build/buy modes, plus the club feature surely took a lot of resources to create. In Sims 3, towns would cost $20, and although Windenburg is smaller than any of Sims 3's worlds, it is surely just as expertly crafted. I paid $25 for this on sale, and I think that's a good deal for this xpac."
433851,5,I haven't managed to finish the game but it arrived on time and plays great. Not as good as the original Pokemon Red in my opinion but it's a great new addition to the series.
351094,5,"I do not have the words for this game. this is the most amazing game i have ever played. It's not the most fun game. the mechanics  have been done before, but the combination of story, performance, and gameplay...... I played through this game 3 times on the ps3, bought it again for the ps4 and beat it a fourth time (along with the amazing dlc Left Behind). i highly recommend this game but also warn that seeing how transcendent this game is within the genre, will make other games of this nature seem...... lacking."
77798,5,"The gold edition is a highly recommended for RTS fans.  The game graphics and animation is stunning, being able to zoom in full detail (with a computer with enough 3D graphics power) makes viewing the replay very entertaining.

 The Winter War expansion includes the Imperial Guard, who are weak in ground troops (max squad size reduced from 15 in the original game down to 10.  Their strength is in vehicles, more notably the artillery Ballisk and Russ tanks.  Heavy infantry Ogryns gives them staying power, but are only available as their ""tech"" level develops.

 Another downside is that the new programming reduces the strength and staying power of the Space Marines too.  Their health upgrades only occur once they advance get to Level 1, no longer do they have the health upgrades at Level 0 and 1.  This makes a big difference in multiplayer mode where Orks can simply rush and hack their way to victory, it is very hard to kill Orks in close combat with basic level units.  It becomes very difficult to defeat the computer in Hard mode as they get their leader unit at the start.  Trying to kill a leader unit with basic infantry units for any race is impossible.  The only way to counter a quick rush is to quickly build listening posts and weapons platforms for defense against their avenue of attack.

 The Winter War expansion campaign consists of 5 Order and 5 Disorder missions.  The last two missions for each side can be played as one of four races, Human or Eldar for the Order, Chaos or Ork for the Disorder.  Each mission for each race occurs on the same battlefield map, but each has separate mission objectives.  Basically the player gets to fight each battle from each different side, pretty neat playability concept.

 The fourth mission is perhaps the toughest one to complete as the player is not only competing against the other side, but also the other ""ally"".  They key to finishing the 4th scenario is to pick one side to play and stick with it.  It is not designed to have the player play both ""allies"" and win, only on side can win the mission.

 The fifth and final mission pits the victor fighting one final battle against not only their arch enemy, but also the Necrons.  Each race has to perform special tasks to win and defeat the Necrons.  For the Imperial Guard, the key is to fortify and develop defense in depth before attempting to rebuild the Titan, landmines really slow down the Necrons.  The player will also need a couple of Russ tanks and four artillery Ballisks to defeat the Necrons.  The other races don't have the luxury of time and will have to balance developing their defenses and accomplishing the special tasks.

 This game is very enjoyable if one want to simply play by building units and fighting battles.  This is not a resource gathering game like Rise of Nations or Empire Earth.  The player is often capped at three ""builder"" units, which fits the game really well, there are only two resources to collect (requisition points by capturing strategic locations and energy by building generators).  Once a resource collection structure is built, it automatically generates so the player isn't distracted in having to assign more ""workers"" to harvest resources like in other real time strategy games.

 Each race also gets a ""super unit"" if they are able to capture an artifact location.  For the Orks (who are really fun to play) it is the Squiggoth, for the Imperials it is the Baneblade super tank, the Eldar and Chaos get their super warrior / demon while the Space Marines get the Rhino tank/ transported (personally prefer the Predator tank myself).

 The game has relatively small armies and limited battlefields.  The game is typically capped out to approximately 6-10 squads and 5-8 vehicles per race.  The battlefields are well balanced, each starting area is given the exact same strategic locations and are a mirror image of each other.  However, there are only a few main attack avenues and with the small number of units, it makes developing two attack groups and one defense group hard to perform.  Once a player is able to advance and secure an opponent's strategic location, their forces are reduced and will need time to reinforce before continuing to advance, by then the opponent may have already recovered and will be ready to slug it out again.  Had there been bigger battlefields and larger armies available, a player could continue to attack and exploit success with a follow-on attack, like in Starcraft of Age of Empires 2 (both can have max population of 200 with very large playing areas).

 Bottom line, one of my friends described it the best, W40K Dawn of War is like playing paintball-speedball/ laser tag, quick and balanced playing fields.  Age of Empires 2 is like playing a paintball game in a field, larger area to cover, more players, not always balanced terrain, and takes more time to finish.  All are fun to play."

I just finished the game, for the second time, got most of the trophies, played some online matches, and I have to say, WOW.  One of the best gaming experiences I have had in a while.  This game excels in every aspect, gameplay, graphics, voice acting, animation, gunplay, platforming, everything.  The attention to detail is phenomenal.  The bar is raised and the new standard is set.  Get this game and enjoy."

338853,5,"Let me preface this review by saying my gaming days go way back.  I mean WAY back to the first Atari and Intellivision.  I have owned virtually every console and have played every type of game...or so I thought.

Enter Tomb Raider Definitive Edition.  This is the first game that to me plays more like a movie rather than a game.  What I mean by that is the cut scenes are so well intertwined in this game that it really feels like you are there and are along for the ride.

The graphics in this game are ridiculous.  There are times I'm playing and just can't believe this is really a game.

I was lucky and got it for $39.99 and can't wait to finish it and play again on a harder level."
288914,5,"Great for the price. The ability to change the game volume, chat volume (friends voices), treble, bass, and mic mute/low/high makes for a very versatile headset. I often times listen to music in this headset and the bass and treble makes for a great experience. Personally never been a fan of wireless headsets, as I don't like messing with the batteries for something that I'm going to use while stationary at my computer desk for sometimes many hours at a time. You can even use this as a headset with your phone without the amp, it sounds great, it just can't get as loud as with the amp."
137438,5,"The graphics on this game is unique, never seen it before.  It's like watercolor fantasy book, absolutely beautiful.  Graphics on SRPG usually doesn't matter, but it's nice to have.  Voice acting is superb.

I've played this for 1 week now, can't stop playing, it's cutting into meal & sleep time.  Yes, it's that good.  The gameplay is awesome, you get limited points to move your characters each turn.  CAn move the same character multiple times each turn or save the points for the next turn.  Plenty of strategy involved.

The story is written well enough that you want to keep playing and find out the end.  ( I haven't finished yet)

Overall, this one is a must buy for any SRPG or RPG gamers out there."
346521,5,Borderlands! What more could you want?!?
357430,5,"This is my first PS4 game. I've been a fan of the series ever since its first installment.

I was disappoint to learn one of my favorite characters, Dizzy, would not be playable but I understand them not being able to include a lot of the old characters because of there switch to the unreal engine.

Besides the standard ""It's a great fighting game"" I want to list some things I didn't realize when I bought the game.

First, the story mode is just that. A story mode. There is no fighting or interaction. Basically it's like watching an anime. That being said I did enjoy the story and it made for a great break after a few hours of gameplay. Plus my wife rather watch the story than watch me play.

Second, two of the characters can be purchased on PS network. That is my biggest gripe about the game. I don't mind maybe paying 1.99 for a character but 8.99 is too steep a price just for another character.

All that aside I loved this game, especially M.O.M mode. It acts like an RPG/Fighting hybrid and is my favorite aspect of the game.

Anyone who is a fighting game fan and especially if you're a Guilty Gear fan should check this one out."
438322,5,I love the series and this installment does not disappoint. However I wish more vocaliods would get more solo songs in the game
145531,5,"The Atari 2600...

For those that remember it during it's heyday, the Atari 2600 was a wonder to behold. The games were diverse, plentiful, and roughly close to their arcade counterparts. Many things about the Atari 2600 resounded within those that played it, making it (still) a viable option amidst all those PS 3's and Xbox 360's..

You might be saying, ""Why would I want to play this old thing with it's clunky graphics and ho-hum sound effects?""..well, maybe not ALL of you will appreciate it's retro-gaming goodness. The graphics are subpar, the sounds are perhaps two-channel and certainly not in stereo sound.

Ahh...but for a good, classic game of Space Invaders or Asteroids, the system cannot be beat. The joysticks are comfortable and the BEST thing about it is it's ONE button to use, not 6, not 16...simply ONE to set the action. THIS is an arcade machine, folks. It was the first system to produce arcade equivalents.

For all you old-timers, you can collect for the system today fairly cheaply. For you younglings, this might not be graphically up to your personal challenge, but a good game of Phoenix or Ms. Pac-Man will have you shooting for those high scores.

Fun for all, even in today's market."
112042,5,"Very good game. A bit of a redundant fighting game, but if you like Mortal Kombat or other tournament fighters, then this is for you. It has a wide variety of game types and characters to choose from. And I mean VERY wide. The only big Bleach characters unavailable would be Kisuke and the people in his shop, and maybe Kukaku, though they both make appearances. Very good game!"
421558,5,"First off, this review is for the Microsoft Xbox One Controller + Wireless Adapter for Windows 10 edition of the controller.  Amazon tends to lump reviews together for multiple variants of the same item, and this is the same.  Make sure this review is relevant for the version you're interested in.  Wish Amazon wouldnt do that.

Anyway, this couldn't have been easier to hook up and get running.  Inside the box was an Xbox One controller, the dongle to make this work, and a cord.  I initially thought the cord was to plug the controller in, but it turns out that is a USB extender cable.

In the instruction sheet, they show a Surface tablet, a more traditional laptop, and a PC.  If you have a PC, they tell you to use the USB extender cable.  If you have the other two, they tell you to plug it straight into the device.  I didn't try plugging the dongle straight into the PC, so Im not sure what would have happened there.

Once you plugged it in, Windows 10 had zero issues in getting it going.  I just plugged it in, it thought for a second, and bam, it was up and running.  Didnt even get a installing drivers.. type popup, it just worked (which is taking a page out of Apples playbook.  I then fired up the controller, pushed the pairing buttons on both sides, and it was up and running.  Total time to get it going was WAY under a minute.  Was quite amazing how flawlessly the setup went.

Im not going to sell you on the virtues of using an Xbox controller.  If you're reading this, then you already know what the controller is like, and are probably interested in this. I cant speak to previous versions of Windows, but for Windows 10, this was a easy as hell setup.  Couldnt be easier.

The only real negative I can say is the controller in here is a battery operated model.  It does come with a pair of batteries in the box (a couple of good Duracells, not some cheap ones), but it *IS* the battery model.  Youll need to keep spares around unless you also buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xbox-One-Play-and-Charge-Kit/dp/B00DBDPOZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xbox One Play and Charge Kit</a>, which is sold separately.

But insofar as what was in this box?  Top notch, couldn't be any easier, and using the Xbox One controller on Windows 10 is quite nice, now that you can stream games from your Xbox One to your Windows 10 machine.  Pretty much a no brainer, I think.  Buy this."
274172,5,"Haven't you wished that your SNES controller didn't need a wire? I sure did after I used the Wavebird Wireless Controller for GameCube! Ten years later, here's the Retro-Bit SuperRetro Wireless Controller. Here's what I think of it:

The controller functions as if the SNES was designed with a wireless capability. Control pad works great, all of the face buttons work great...but as other reviewers have said, the L and R buttons are a little bit too close to the palm. It's not the trigger finger using them, it's the center knuckle. And that can be a problem on Pilot Wings, as that hair-trigger reaction might take some adjustment to master. After all, it's no longer the tip of your finger that triggers it but your entire finger. But that's a minor thing compared to the freedom wireless provides.

Other reviewers have said that the controller did not come with synchronizing instructions, and therefore I looked specifically for those instructions, as I didn't remember how they said it worked. Thank God instructions came with mine. I synchronized it, then...my battery petered out. Bad luck, but they were old dying batteries anyway (laugh my head off.) I inserted new batteries and of course it functions as it should!

Do you love the SNES as much as I do? Then modernize it with this controller! I'd suggest a two-pack, though. I couldn't afford it but it saves you a bit of money and the hassle of shipping two separate controllers. You'll love it. Oh yes, might I suggest you get some Energizer AAA rechargables? That will save you even more money on batteries."

I do feel like the original Dirt was a better game but, there is nothing wrong with this game.  The graphics are excellent, the driving is fluid and realistic.  I didn't mind that there weren't 200 different cars to drive because this isn't the type of game you'd spend over a 100 hours playing.  The track layouts are fun and visually incredible, I liked that there were tracks featured from all over the world.  If I had one complaint it would be the cheesy lines said by other drivers when you give them ""love taps""  but this feature can be turned off in the audio menu so it wasn't a big deal.  I think Codemasters did a great job and I look forward to a third installment in the Dirt series."

238112,5,"Although I was a bit skeptical about getting the second installment of this new series, a friend convinced me to get it and this game is awesome. The fist games of the Black and White series have an awesome storyline that was really surprising as a long time player of Pokemon. This game doesn't quite have the same storyline punch but makes up for it in the amount of content that it adds. You can catch so many more Pokemon in this game than any other and there are fun side quests like Join Avenue that you can link things you do online with.

The only bad side is that I've found myself playing this game too much and I loose focus as to what Pokemon I want to be raising. :P This game is really awesome other than that."

oh yeah!, you have to take driving course 101 to play the game but it is really easy!
PEACE"
12928,5,"Black Isle first made Planescape: Torment, which was a plot driven game without any focus on combat. Now, they made Icewind Dale, which is the exact opposite.
The plot in this game is thin, just an excuse to go through massive dungeons killing hordes of monsters and findings tons of goodies. Whereas, in PS:T, combat was just there to drive the plot.
This game is one of the best in character creation fun, second only to Baldur's Gate 2. But, in this game, you can create six characters of your own without losing out on NPC interaction. In BG 2, you had the option of getting prefabricated NPCs to join you, who had personality and charm. There was guilt if you made your own six characters. In IWD, no such dilemma exists, so one is free to make whatever sort of party that suits one's playing style.
Another bonus is the nice atmosphere. Jeremy Soule's music is beautiful and the artwork from Black Isle is great.
All in all, excellent Infinity Engine game. Buy it now!"

448392,5,My nephew loves this game and got it just for him after he caught me playing Sega lol you can play as Dr. Grant or a velociraptor in sidescoller action adventure.
466949,5,"This is one of those games that slipped under the radar screen.  This game should get a lot higher reviews than what it has been getting.  If you like the Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth, Rise of Nations, Empire Earth, or Age of Empires series of games you will end up loving this game.  This game has got so much cool stuff.  This game takes place during ancient times in the Mediterranean area.

  In Single Player, there are three campaigns to play.  You can play the Spartans campaign, the Eygptians campaign, or the Persians campaign.  There are ten missions in each campaign.

  The first thing I noticed was how great the graphics are in this game.  The detail on everything is unbelievable.  For instance, when I look at the different terrain in the game, you can actually see the shadows from the clouds overhead going across the surface of the land.  Even when birds fly overhead, I can actually see the shadows of the birds on the ground while they fly by.  The water looks just like real.  When I look out at the water, I can actually see the reflection of the sun hitting the water.

  There are all kind of animals in the game. You can see a cobra snake slide across the ground or see a rabbit hopping around.  When you build sheep farms, you can actually see sheep wandering around.  Same thing when you build stables. What is so cool is that you don't make horses with soldiers already mounted on the horses like you do in other games.  You actually make the horses themselves and then  you can mount any of your heroes or soldiers on top of the horses.  I have never seen that in any game I have ever played before.  When you build ships at your shipping docks, your ships are actually made with sailors actually working the oars of the ships.  I have never seen that before in a game either.

The forts are so cool.  You can build walls around your fort and then you can build gates so your units can come and go into your fort.  You can put archers up on your walls to your fort so they can shoot down at the enemy down below on the ground.  When you attack any enemy buildings, your units will use torches to burn the buildings down.  If you have any enemy units try to burn down your buildings, you have laborers that actually use buckets of water to try to douse out the fires.

 This game has a lot of replay value.  If you like strategy games like I do, then I recommend for you to go out and buy this game.  This is also a excellent way to learn about actual ancient history."
250630,5,it does what it does blocks the camera and sensors without covering the mic or most importantly the kinect heat vents that might cause it to overheat. has the same color as the kinect so it won't look out of place recommend for the price

146082,5,"Mass Effect - Circa 2007

GOOD:
- A third person shooting and cover system similar to that of Gears of War or Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter 2 which is really a unique way to play a RPG. The Cover systems works well it also makes for a fun as well as a more realistic gameplay experience. While this system has its share of problems (its not as easy or streamline as Gears of War) it works well enough not to be a concern and bring something new to RPGs.
- A well thought out and well played story that rivals or bests that of Elder Scrolls, Resident Evil or any Final Fantasy game. The story itself is it told through dialog between yours and other characters, because of the choices of make during the story it has a ""choose your own adventure"" feel to it.
- Gorgeous graphics and nice animations, that look just as good as games like Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Assassins Creed.
- A great sound track that has the movie like quality of some of the great Sci-Fi Space movies from the past twenty years like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, and Dune.

BAD:
- The learning curve is steep in this game and you will spend the first few hours learning how to play this game well. Although gamers who are use to playing First/Third Person Shooters (like Bioshock and Ghost Recon: Advance Warfighter) may find it easier to play (they should start the game on hard). Gamers who like playing turn based RPGs (like Final Fantasy X and Blue Dragon) will have a hard time adjusting (they should play the game on normal or easy).
- Most side quest planets can be barren with little to do outside of the quest you came for and a scant few other item pickups scattered around, plus many structures/buildings you enter during these side missions are almost exactly the same.
- The inventory system that you use keep track of items as well as equip items on your character is not very streamline and can be annoying due to the fact that there is no way to organize your inventory in any real order and keeping track of more then a few items becomes something of a chore.
- This game has a more then a few loading sequences during gameplay that might upset impatient gamers.

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- The story of the game is mostly told through dialogs between yourself and other characters in the game, it should really be noted that your choices in responding to questions asked of you and your reactions to events unfolding around you is going to change the story of the game and attitudes of others around you. It should also be noted that during the games story you can make choices that either make your character into a brash loose cannon who cheats, steals and shoots first asks questions later or a by the book fighter or justice and freedom with moral values and willing to sacrifice personal wants for the good of others.
- A Sci-Fi RPG with lots of Third Person Shooter (Camera behind the player) elements. The games combat has quicker pacing then most RPGs like Final Fantasy XII or even Fable, although the over all combat is slower then more main stream First/Third Person Shooters like Halo or Lost Planet, the shooting aspect has an emphasis on shooting behind cover as well similar to games like Gears of War and Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter 2.
- You start will all the gun types your ever going to get in the game (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle) you can of course get newer versions of these guns and later even add mods to modify the effects and stats of each gun type. Although the effectiveness of each gun type is really depends on your skill with that gun type (you upgrade your gun skills at your stat screen), you can of course use guns you have no training for which will result in much less effectiveness of using that gun type, so it would be wise to always try to use guns types your character class can (will be able to) upgrade. Note: Solider class is proficient in all gun types (can upgraded in all gun types).
- This game has lots of dialog/story, which plays a very big role in this game, which in turn will turn off gamers looking for fast paced action with little interruption.
- No multiplayer or online gameplay.
- Travel to many different worlds/solar systems through out the Milky Way galaxy (the galaxy you currently live in) with your own star ship the Normandy and its crew. During your missions you get to bring two of six other characters with you and these other characters (all six of them) can have their stats as well as equipment be chosen by you.

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Xbox/PC)
- Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter 2 (360/PS3)
- Jade Empire (Xbox/PC)
- Gears of War (360/PC)
- Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion (360/PS3/PC)

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- To get all of this game's achievements your going to have to beat this game at least three time. You get an achievement for beating the game once as well as twice but to unlock the ""Insanity"" difficultly (which after beating the game on this difficultly you also get an achievement) your going to have to beat the game on Hard then Hardcore just to unlock that difficultly.
- In the limited collector's edition you will find an art and background story book ""Galactic Codex"" as well as a bonus DVD with the videos ""The Making of Mass Effect"" documentary /music (from the game)/360 dashboard themes and it all comes in a tin case.
- There is already a novel out called Mass Effect: Revelation, which has lots of background story for the game as well as the background for the characters you meet in the game Anderson and Saren.
- There is talk from Bioware about downloadable content coming on the way for Mass Effect."
93417,5,"So, if you are looking at this, you must have the Wii. If you have not played a game that requires this, you are in for a lot of fun. This  nunchuck is very comfortable and fits in my hand well. It is intuitive and easy to handle. It also takes a beating, as the two originals we have been using have survived my 4 and 5.5 year old kids well."
417902,5,Brand new and perfect fit for my son's 3DS!
181251,5,"Though I don't like the plastic gears used in the until, i still ike its ability to play titles properly like Rfactor and Project Cars, where my beloved Fanatec CSR just had too much re-coding I needed to do on my own to make even remotely useful on the PC.

I am a fabricator so i am looking into the possiblity of making replacement gears for the internals and making them out of a solid metal with good fatigue resistance so I can use it for what I bought it for, a cheap tool to practice with and save money on tires, track fees and damage to the practice missile."
340622,5,I'm exploring the game and the quality is perfect I'm giving this product 5 stars for sure
114844,5,"Im a big fan of Agatha Christie, & I wasn't disappointed with this game, got stuck once, but I finally figured it out without going to the walkthru. Played 3 times so far & I know I'll play this one again & again."
287133,5,This thing works like a charm.  I got it hooked up to X-Box 360.  Very useful gadget.

112232,5,"Seriously, if I could make love to a video game, I'd never get out of bed with COD4. This game = pure joy. I've played the COD:WAW beta, and trust me, COD4 blows its socks off. Infinity Ward are great developers. Treyarch wishes they could be IW."
131083,5,"If you are looking for a very convoluted, mysteriously morbid Japanese RPG, you have found the perfect game. You're welcome."

487899,5,good game if you like zombies
110538,5,He likes the charger
243885,5,"I have just recently finished the story to this game and I thought I would just write a small review saying that this is one of the finest fps games I have played.  Definitely a top contender for shooter of the year.  The visuals, especially the island, look amazing.  The action is intense, varied, and extremely fun.  There are so many options on how you tackle a situation.
There are plenty of things to do on the island to raise your money and xp.  The money can be spent on more powerful weapons(which there are plenty of) and the xp can be spent on upgrades and abilities for your character that really enhance the way the game is played.
I will admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the FC2. It was fun at first but quickly became repetitive and boring due to many flaws in the game.  Thankfully, FC3 contains none of these flaws.  This is definitely the Far Cry that we have been wanting and I am incredibly excited to see where it goes from here."
2331,5,Works great love it
304212,5,great game as expected
239262,5,"start to finish run and gun fun! Eye popping graphics, tons of missions long game with lots to do, goofy sarcastic and gory"
183417,5,"I have to say I enjoyed this game a lot more than MW2. The single player is more challenging, The multiplayer is a lot of fun, and almost everything is destructable. Also the multiplayer encourages teamwork more. On MW2 everyone's just trying to get the most kills. Anyway, give this game a chance. I think you'll enjoy it."
348962,5,Works great
69465,5,"The Wii is the best console for all ages.  It has games for all, for the kiddies, and elderly it has Wii sports, etc.  For the mature, there's RE4, RE: UC, Red Steel, Bwii, Metroid Prime 3, etc.  So don't let some PS3 fanboy spamming the Wii forums with repetitive posts (at a time when GHIII is dominating on the Wii, while the PS3 version just seems to stay on the shelf) delude your decision with their extremely expensive console!  Bottom line, Wii rules, PS3 employees invade the Wii and PS3 forums on amazon to swade people to buy the extremely expensive/lacking originality PS3.  Wii>PS3"
260350,5,"I already had the normal version of this game for PS3 when I got this, but since it was so cheap (it was on sale,the price here is now much higher)I figured I would get it. For what you're spending this is a really cool set! It comes with the 4 disc soundtrack, a small book of art, and of course the game/instructions. It all comes in a really nice box that opens up like a book with everything inside. The sound track is about 100 tracks total, so if you had a favorite song in the game it's bound to be on one of the discs. The art book can't really be removed from the case it comes in, but it's still cool to look at. Lastly the game itself is really fun, and improves on a lot of problems that were in the first game. My only problem with it was that while they did improve the exploration aspects of the game, the story seemed to be lacking. XIII had a much more developed and clear story, while XIII-2 could get confusing at times. The ending (no spoilers) was also a really big disappointment, although hopefully Lightning Returns addresses this issue."

376154,5,"Picked one up at target about 3 weeks ago, just to try it out. I've heard a lot of horror stories about double clicking and stuff so I just gave it a try, so far no issues
Previously I was using a Logitech g502 proteus core, and I wanted a secondary mouse on the go. The deathadder is significantly lighter than the g502, but it fits in my hand more comfortably

Pros: Comfortable grip, feels nice in your hand
Great sensor, tracks over the bumps on my table without an issue
Clicks feel crisp and are easy to press
Side button are convenient
Able to change colors of logo and mouse wheel with ease

Cons: mouse wheel feels a little cheap and light
Software is a little clunky, requires an Internet connection
Lighting on the mouse wheel could've been better, a little faint

Overall this mouse has been great so far, tracks well over my steel series qck heavy
I can do flickshots pretty well in CSGO
I like how you can change x y dpi s independently, something useful to have in a game like CSGO
If all goes well I might just end up keeping it."
287342,5,This game plays well and the classic RE atmosphere is back. The WiiU Gamepad makes item management a snap. I recommend switch the aiming speed to 1 below default. It can be a bit jerky otherwise.
232350,5,Cool!
98652,5,"Bioshock is a horror/survival gamers dream come true. It has a strong story line, beautiful graphics, and heart pounding action. I come from the era of Rule of Rose, Haunting Ground, and Trapt. Horror and survival games that left the gamer wanting more. So when companies stopped creating survival games with memorable and twisted story lines, I was one of the many disappointed/disgusted gamers out there. But Bioshock is an amazing game and it gives me hope that horror/survival games could possibly make a strong come back."

11396,5,mega man X3 is awesome a classic the best of the best best video game ever buy this game if your a super nintendo fan you won't be sorry
377681,5,"Well, Its DOA 5, with a new hat.  I have played (replayed) about 1.5 hours of the story mode on each system, and its pretty much the same as DOA 5.  The differences are mostly in the looks of the game, and a couple new characters that I haven't had a chance to play with yet, if they added to the story its not until later in the game, but everything I have encountered states that they are not in the story, only in the ""arcade"" or online matches, which is okay.  As far as the gameplay goes, it is very well done;  the upgraded textures and models are fantastic, the movement is very smooth and responsive (which DOA has always been great with), and the ""signature physics of DOA"" have been upgraded a bit (change this in the options menu).  Overall, the changes are great, and visuals are very impressive on both systems, and the fighting is even more fluid than the original.

As far as differences between the two systems (here come the trolls), there isn't a lot of difference between PS4 and X1 visually, a few color balance differences, shading differences, and the textures are a bit different, but both systems look great and you probably wouldn't notice if you weren't playing them back to back or side to side.  I am sure people will argue about this online (brand loyalists, to put it nicely), but I am here to tell you the difference is subjective, and neither one really looks better than the other in this game.  Where there WAS a VERY SLIGHT difference in gameplay itself, was in the responsiveness.  The PS4 was just a little more responsive than the X1, and a little more fluid, but again, probably not something you would notice if you were not playing back to back.  The difference between the PS3 and PS4 is much greater, and if you enjoy this game on PS3, you will enjoy it even more on the PS4.  I cannot compare the XBox 360 to the X1, as I have not played it on 360, but I am sure the differences are comparable to the PS versions.  If you own either the PS4, or XB1, and you enjoy DOA, I highly recommend this upgraded version (if you own both, get whichever is your favorite, you won't be missing out with one system over the other this time); If you enjoy fighting games, and haven't tried DOA yet, I can almost assure you that you will love it as it is a very responsive, fluid, and fast paced fighter that really can't be beat.

All in all, its D.O.A., with the best graphical engine in the series to date, there isn't much else to say about it (and that isn't a bad thing)."
373686,5,Works as advertised. No Complaints.

24348,5,"I was looking around my room and stumbled on my old PS2, I decided to play it again but I must of thrown out my old PS2 memory card cause could not find it anywhere. I saw this one and did not really want to spend that much on a memory card so got this one. It is great, had it for more than a month or two and it works great. Works like any other memory card but a fraction of the price, I enjoy playing my old favorits like Metal Gear and The Thing. I would recommend this to anyone wanting play there old PS2 favorites again."
8818,5,"For the first time see Duke in third-person perspective. Duke Nukem is absolutely the best game on ps1(followed closely by soul reaver 1)because it has guns,strippers(fun to kill),humor,and above all else Duke Nukem.

Story:You are on your way to you faveorite strip club. While there the Pigs come and turn Duke's 'hog into a pink trike and kill a lot of people. Kill the people but mess with Duke's 'hog your gonna pay.

Gameplay:Similar to the Tomb Raider series but better. Sure we now have Dual Analog games but once you get used to it it is fun. Manual aiming is good but the auto aim is even better. Swiiming is a cinch. Plus you get to kill strippers!

Weapons:Awesome weapons. Your trusty pistol the Desert Eagle never fails to kill,the Combat Shotgun kicks series Booty(licious),the Buffalo Rifle is awesome,the Chain Gun kills all in the way,the Mighty Boot which is fun but dangerous to us and many other fantastic weapons.

Graphics:Excellent in their day but not so good now. But you can see everything that you need to to finish a level. Although what more than makes up fo the graphics is the ability to blow your enemies to bits with a pipe bomb. You actually see the arms,legs and head go flying around. Also,if you're a good shot you can blow off a pigs head. If the Pig is close to the wall he leaves a blood stain(or several)on the walls and floor. Enemies are designed great and Duke looks like he benches 800lbs. Interact with almost everything and anybody.

Missions:Fun yet difficult. No blow this up,kill this guy,or get out before time runs out garbage. Just find a way to reach the exit.

Levels:Designed great. Long and Perty.

Humor:Duke is one funny son-uva-gun. He says all these stupid yet funny things like I've got balls of steel! and Come get some! plus all these other outragouse and not-for-Amazon.com things(play the game to find out what).Also this game has strong sexual themes for those of you that are sensetive about that but you can turn the gore off if you want.

The Bad:A little difficult near the end,ammo depletes fast,and health seems to deteriorate in gun fights(it goes from 100 to 65 and you're like wha!!??).That is all I see bad in this awesome game and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
244850,5,Great game. It has nice graphics and fun features and fun multiplayer levels.
403417,5,This must be the most amazing detailed game ever. And trumping fallout 3 in every way is an achievement in itself. The new city building feature alone is amazing you can build your own city from scratch collecting each and ever bottle cap to make generators houses and defenses. The new fps element is much more fluid too playing a lot more action game like. Every thing is better even jet now slows time with motion blur. But the huge world tons of quests and the fact that simple doors lead to whole new worlds of creatures and adventures is incredible. Try to limit three hours a day to not neglect your family too much.  I can't even imagine the season pass I got the old expansions were huge.
459568,5,"Received product quickly. Came as described,In original case with cover art and manual. Disc is in Immaculate condition! Would buy from seller again. A+

If you're on the fence about this series i recommed you give it a try and you won't be dissapointed. Great humor and the game doesnt take itself too seriously. Fun battle system, good music and more!"

Having heard this line before I assumed it would just be a passing phase.
Nope. It is indeed his favorite game ever. Kinda makes me wish we had another TV and console so that the rest of us can play or watch something.....
..... and ok maybe another one of these games seeing as how everyone else seems to like it too."

259395,5,"I am a very big fan of this kind of strategy games and especially this series. When I saw all the bad reviews, I got dissapointed to know that Firefly launched unfinished game. However, I waited for quite long time to buy it, install it and play it. All the bugs and problems are now fixed. I was testing the game all the time while playing and it really works just fine. Yet, I am still wondering why the Compnay rushed in launching the game and got all these very bad reviews. Although the game is fixed later, yet bad reviews are still the majority. I just wanted to write this to let people know that the game is completely fixed."
258008,5,"If you're on a budget and looking to get your hands on a decent gaming keyboard look no further! This is a steal! I picked one of these up along side the G9X MW3 Edition and have to say for their prices they're great! Prior to this keyboard I was using a Razer Tarantula that unexpectedly gave out on me. Whilst in need of a replacement I decided to give this a shot. I sincerely enjoy the feel, the layout, the features, and it's overall appearance! If it holds up I'll be sure to buy another in the future just in case!

I would certainly recommend it!

Note: I gave this keyboard along with the G9X a shot while using Penguin United's Eagle Eye on my Xbox 360! Both products appear to work great!"

The Wii not only helps us to achieve fitness as a family, but also to have fun while doing it (something my treadmill was sorely lacking). I am beyond happy that we finally sprang to purchase this! I was pleasantly surprised to see that it arrived quickly and with so many games. I highly recommend this for anyone who lives in the freezing cold weather, and has kids that have an over abundance of energy to expel. Great way to shake those winter blahs! Thanks Nintendo!"

36964,5,"The ever lasting Castlevania series hit incredibly high on the GBA with the release of Circle of the Moon.  Circle of the Moon being one of the best Castlevania games ever made (though, once again, nothing compares to Symphony of the Night).  Harmony of Dissonance, the second of the GBA games, is also a fantastic game.

Castlevania almost never tells a different story.  This time it's Juste Belmont out to defeat the evil count.  Castlevania hasn't been about story so much as it's been about gameplay.  Harmony of Dissonance certainly does have good gameplay.

Once again, Castlevania takes on a Metroid feel as you explore through the castle.  Some areas can't be reached until you've got certain abilities and have defeated certain bosses, but for the most part, the game is highly non-linear.  You can tackle the game in almost any order you feel.

Juste arms himself with a whip.  It's the only weapon he uses.  You can press and hold B and it'll dangle and you can control it, but you'll almost never need or use this move throughout the game.  Juste can also use secondary weapons such as the Cross, Axe, Holy Water and Dagger.  There are a few more than this, but these are the basics that have been in just about every Castlevania game.  Now, however, you can combine them with different kinds of special magic books.  While Juste can only carry one sub-weapon at a time, the results of combinging it with an elemental magic book is different.  There aren't nearly as many combinations as the Circle of the Moon's DSS Card System, but it gives the game enough variety to the point where it isn't stale.

Harmony of Dissonance isn't a hard game.  In fact, in comparison to Circle of the Moon, it's incredibly easy.  Even the games bosses are not much of a challenge at all.  It's a fun trip, but it's a lot easier than your standard Castlevania.

However, despite it's ease, the game looks absolutely fantastic.  The GBA's power really shines with this game.  The environments are decorative, and they're not quite as dark as Circle of the Moon's.  The bosses and castle design also look refreshingly fantastic.

Then we get to the music.  The music really should've been better, but to clear a couple of things up, I'll tell you why the music isn't a fault of this game.  For one, if you disliked the music... good.  You're NOT supposed to like this music.  The subtitle of the game is, after all, Harmony of Dissonance.  The music does a great job of giving the feeling of dissonance.  It's easily demonstrated in how people negatively feel about the music.  So the music IS horrible, but it isn't meant to be good.  It's meant to give the feeling of dissonance and it succeeds simply because most people don't like it.  So no, you're not supposed to like the music in this game.  In fact, you're supposed to hate it.  So the reviewers saying the music is terrible are absolutely right.  But it's not supposed to be good.

Harmony of Dissonance is a great addition to the Castlevania series, but it really doesn't do much to separate it from others in the series.

The Good

+Fantastic visuals

+The music gives the feeling of dissonance

+A lot of variety to the gameplay

+Great bosses and exploration

The bad

-The music, as many have said... isn't good, but it's not supposed to be likeable

-It's way too easy"

300360,5,"This is by far the greatest keyboard I've ever used. I was debating on either blue switches or red switches and a friend explained more that red are for gaming and blue are for typers well once I decided and went from rubber footed keyboards to this incredible mechanical keyboard I've noticed a major change. a bit of a curve getting used to it at first but once I got into it, there is nothing like it in existence.

Pros:
feels great
works incredibly
audible clicking which i love
red switches with interchangable key caps
individual light up keys
18 macro keys
a windows lock button

Cons:
honestly there aren't many cons to this product
only thing I could think of was that the LED lights under the keyboard cannot change colors."

313616,5,"I love mario party, and this game has a lot of similarities and a few differences.  The gameplay mechanic is mostly the same, but without the power ups it's a little less cutthroat.  All the players are Miis instead of game characters.  The audience responses to dice rolls as well as the announcers indiscernible accent are highly entertaining, especially after a few drinks.  It's a great addition to any Wii U owners catalog, and at $40, you're basically buying the controller and getting the game for free."

186981,5,"Set two years after the events of Mass Effect, Commander Shepard returns to face a new threat to the human race: the Collectors and their possible connection to the Reapers.

Mass Effect 2 has changed drastically from the first and many choices you made in the Mass Effct resurface such as the ending you recieved in the first game. The combat has changed to feel more like a 3rd-person shooter and it was for the best. Its faster paced, more exciting, and the enemy AI has been improved significantly. Unfortunatly allie AI has become more of a burden if your not constantly controlling their actions. A new feature is the Paragon and Renagade action during certain cutscenes were Shepard can turn the tide of a battle with heroic or badass actions. Weapons have recived ammo and heavy weapons have been introduced, making the player make more tactic based stragities to conserve ammo, but all enemies drop ammo if need for the exception of heavy wepon ammo. The game has lost a lot of its RPG feeling such as different armor since your limited to the same armor with some customization, and various weapons. Characters have to be loyalized to increase their odds of surviving the final mission, and upon doing so they also unlock new abilities. The game does have some flaws such as the cover system, but nothing to serious that makes it unplayable. I recommend the game to any person, wether they like RPGs or not."

44060,5,"This is the first Grand Theft Auto title I've played since the original came out several years ago.  I thoroughly enjoyed the original, so when my fiance got this version for his birthday I stole it and started playing it myself. :D The first several missions are great - they're easy enough to beat without a lot of trouble, while giving you time to get used to the controls.  The storyline is a lot of fun, the graphics are really well done, everything is fun!  My only complaint is that some of the missions are extremely hard for me, as I am not used to playing games like this.  I have been stuck on this one RC helicopter mission for weeks now!  I wish they had a built in cheat to stop the mission timer, because I am fed up with that mission and just want to get it over with.  I can't complain too much about that, it's just my crappy game skillz. ;)  I give this game 5 stars, because the bottom line for all games is that they need to be FUN - and this one definitely is!"

389453,5,"I got lucky enough to grab one in store. Now I want to write a positive review on this product because that is what the item deserves. The images that you will find on google and the picture on the box doesn't do it justice. It is absolutely beautiful. Looks even better in person. The new features of the new 3ds xl are great improvements but are yet to be fully used. I haven't quite had a game that had me rely on the extra shoulder buttons or the ""c"" stick often. Being a Zelda fan, it blows to see such a small quantity released but I guess that is what makes it a limited edition. Paying more for an exclusive that someone might be reselling for the sole purpose of making profit isn't new folks. When you look for a pre-owned copy of Majora's Mask for the N64 on craigslist or anywhere else the price WILL be higher than usual because it is an item that people will offer more for. Not anyone's fault really. It's a limited edition. If you're looking to pay retail price or a resellers price for an exclusive item is completely up to you. I love mine, and like a decent fan, I will be taking exquisite care of it til I am ready to part with it and let another fan enjoy or collect the item, as he/she wishes..."
5834,5,It is a good port of  the PC version  and I guess the only drawback would be the password system within the game since you can't save your progress through your memory card  but I don't mind it too much
335795,5,"For the money, this headset rocks.

I love it.

The sound is clear, the bass is perfect, and no one can hear what I'm playing but me.  The volume control on the left ear is super.  And I can hear enemies from ahead, to either side, and even behind me.  It has improved my gaming experience a thousand percent.

Thank you, Turtle Beach."
447337,5,Works great with Gameboy Printer!
360772,5,Forza Horizon 2 is one of those games that just makes you happy to play.  It is so colorful and gorgeous that it's a visual feast for your eyes.  The rain effects and night time driving are awesome additions.  This is one of the only open world racing games where driving around is just as fun as the actual races.  A must play game.

482141,5,"Hey Rayfans, It's been way over 15 years since the first launch of Rayman & with this iteration of Rayman, Rayman Origins, Michel Ancel, the creator of Rayman, went all out on this one!  In this Rayman the game includes over 100 characters, 12 unique worlds and over 60 levels of gameplay. Thats HUGE!!! The characters that you will play such as Rayman, Globox and the Teensies will gain unique abilities as they progress through the adventure, including swimming, diving, slapping, and the ""HairlyCopter."" The game also features tons of unforgettable action, adventure, beat-'em-up gameplay and alot of slapstick comedy to boot. Some scenes are just halarious.

The graphics are outstanding and whimsiclal, and just generally quite the treat for your eyes. This game will be enjoyed by everyone in the family and is great for all ages. There are some bosses that are kind of hard to beat so it is not just a simplistic type of childs game but also enjoyed by the older crowd too. We really need more games like this instead of the overabundance of first person shooters kill em style games..  This is a quite a long game that will not be finshed in just one or two evenings. Expect it to take quite a few evenings of gameplay to beat this one. Frame rate is great and there is no jerky motion, no dropouts on video quality and I ran in to zero bugs!!

If you are at all interested in this game, BUY IT! You will not regret it."
342736,5,"Bought one for my gaming/design desktop. Loved it. Wife tried it, she loved it. We bought another one for her to game on. My 5 year old tried it and wanted one. We're up to 3. Now I bought 2 more as backups in case of damage. If one family loves it enough to buy 5 within a year that should be pretty good indication. Great mouse, worth the money. Buy it!

Update: bought 3 more for the office staff to use. They love it too. The finish seems to change a bit from mouse to mouse, I preferred the one w/ a bit more texture."
270691,5,Thanks
55808,5,"I remember getting PONG as a kid.  I remember mowing lawns so I could co to the arcade downt he block.  Platformers, like racing and sports games, are the oldest surviving types of video games out there.  Platformers seemed like they were ready to die out a few years back.  After all, what new could be done with them?

Quite a bit it seems.  The insperation of the Grant Theft Auto lure of 'go anywhere, anytime, do anything"" breathed new life in what I had thought was a dying game type.  At first, when I played Jak II I thought they were just going to be a cutesy rip off of GTA, but the story slowly sucked you in, the characters were sympathetic and the city was unique (if a bit hard to get around)

Jak II was gritty enough that I, as a thirty something, could enjoy it.  Yet still I felt safe in letting my little girls (7,6 and 4) watch me play and even play themselves.

There was the down side of the city itself.  It did take a while to get from point A to B.  And god help you if you so much as brush against a Crimson Guard.  Also, while the zoomers were fun, there were several points you had to drive like mad from here to there and you just kept sliding into walls because the zoomers were so loose in the stearing dept.

Despite this I LOVED Jak II.  Took my time in beating it, sort of savoring it.  If JakIII does nothing but expand a bit over number 2 (new weapons, vehicles, some new territory ect) it would be well worth it to me.

Despite the fact that its comming out at Xmas time Ill be making room for this one in my budget."
324525,5,"It's a Ps4 controller charger. As described. Cute and discreet.
I find pushing the controller straight down from the top middle works best to avoid odd angles while docking/undocking.

I avoid 3rd party miniUSB charging docks. This one uses the mic port and is much more consistent."
163087,5,"These are FANTASTIC! The controllers work wonderfully on our Wii. We have no complaints, & my kids love using these to play their newly discovered Gamecube games they got for Christmas. Five stars for the seller and shipping. Thank you."
131171,5,"It's kind of difficult to be a gamer in the next-gen era since there's just so many games that it is kind of difficult to invest the kind of hours a game requires since there is so many games that interest you and with work, school etc taking up time as well, it can be tricky trying to play everything that comes down the pipe. Strange as it is, I haven't played much DS games but not for lack of games but just lack of funds. I thought I'd give The World Ends With You a shot and while I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite games on the DS, it's sure quite fun to play anyway.

Story: You play as Neku, a kid who is more comfortable being by himself and doesn't want to rely on anyone (a kid after my own heart, it seems). He awakens in the Shibuya District in Tokyo with amnesia and no clue of how we arrived. Soon, he receives a message to be somewhere in 60 minutes or face erasure. With the ability to read minds and teaming up with a young girl, Shiki, Neku has to complete various tasks and take on numerous creatures lest he face being erased.

Graphics: The game's graphics go for more a presentation rather than really going all-out in terms of the visuals. With character designs from Tetsuya Nomura who worked on various Final Fantasy games and the movie, the game takes on a comic-book feel mixed with 2D graphics to create the world which is quite inviting and certainly never boring.

Sound/Music: The voice acting is kind of scattered with voice clips and sentences now and then as well as the occasional ""huh?"" when a character's confused or surprised. It works well within the game though too bad it wasn't voice acting the entire game. As for the music, it's a good mix of J-Pop and Rock and even though I wouldn't really call it a buy or even download-worthy but it works quite well and I never felt like I had to put on my own music.

Gameplay: Most DS games use either screen as a map or extra gameplay features such as accessing special attacks or character stats. This game however requires both to fight as Neku and his partner have to battle the creatures on both screens in a sort-of tag team as Neku battles with the stylus on the bottom while the partner takes on the same enemy with the D-Pad or the face buttons on the top. Beat an enemy on one screen and it disappears from both screen so coordination and combos are extremely helpful. In fact they're kind of a necessity since successful attacks will pass a ""puck"" to the other player and keep it going long enough and better attacks will form. I will admit at first it was hard to keep track of both screens but while I still got hit quite a bit, I became a lot better and with the game's adjustable difficulty menu (the ""harder"" you make it, the better items and EXP you get) so it's best to start slow.

Neku uses attacks based on ""pins"" which are basically equippable moves that can level up the more you use them. One requires a vertical slash with the stylus to cut enemies while another can allow you to nab cars and other objects and fling them at enemies. Tap repeatedly for bullets, drag to create a fire trail or slash vertically to create ice columns are just some of the special attacks that you can utilize. If you don't have a screen protector yet, buy one since the action can get quite scratch-heavy and a protector will help. Another is that it's very easy to miss your enemy and with a usage timer that has to recharge before you can use it again, you'll probably rely on a certain set of pins for best in battle.

Other things can be used such as shops where you can buy clothing and wearing certain clothing in certain areas will give you bonuses since you're more ""with it"". It is isn't like say San Andreas where you can make your guy super muscular or ridiculously fat but it gives more options for strategy and gameplay changes. Other things like eating food which takes time to digest which will also give you stats help with playing the game and the customizing and new game+ features help the game feel more fresh the more you play. A word of caution though: this game can easily kick your *** if you're not careful and I often found myself being attacked from all sides on both screens because my eyes or fingers weren't fast enough but not to dissuade gamers from picking it up since it is fun and certainly different than ""press X"" gameplay but it took some getting used to.

There's games that are a bit more niche audience and more for a certain kind of gamer but I'd say everyone needs to at least play The World Ends With You at least once. Not just for the uniqueness of it but the possibility after all the weirdness that you just might end up loving it."

260836,5,"It is a great game!

Pros
-Great city building game
-Lots of fun to make an efficient city
-Multiplayer works well and great saving mechanics
-plenty to do! (daily missions, campaign, dlc, etc and more)

Cons
-VERY time consuming! ( could be a pro? You could easily waste 100 hrs+ on one game save.
-Military is lacking in the game but isn't bad by any stretch. (not really the point of the game anyways)
-Personally I find it very hard to start a multiplayer game with more than one or two people. (Matches last many gaming sessions and for long periods and if you start without them their cities disappear)"
315485,5,"The Smash Bros. game with the most content, great online play, fun amiibo support, and so much more; and now that the DLC content is fully released, there's enough in this game to keep you coming back for more, and challenge others online."

25442,5,"If you liked Quake III or other first-person shooting games or are a fan of the Star Trek universe, then you should get this game.  It doesn't have the best graphics but it uses the Quake III engine.  The character voices are like the ones on the show and the weapons each have two shooting modes.  It is a fun game that has a good storyline."

144108,5,i love it thx its perfect
489510,5,"This game may seem simple at first, but over time shows the balance of the design and how the game expands as you go further along.

The game elements are simple: you have a digging machine, with limited fuel, durability and storage capacity.  By retrieving minerals buried in the ground, either to the side or below you on the 2D field, you can can money with which you buy upgrades to expand each of those elements.  Due to the directional limitations of your digging capability, you can often be blocked from reaching some of the minerals.  Bombs, which explode in various patterns, also become available which will allow you to remove blocks from the field, perhaps making it possible to reach otherwise unreachable minerals.

There is an additional puzzle element to the game as well, as the order in which you retrieve various minerals determines their value and perhaps what you gain in return.

Multi-player elements factor in as well, though I haven't explored that aspect as much.  Local play is limited to a single screen, so you can affect other players by dragging the screen.

There is also a background story to the game, which unfolds as you dig deeper and deeper, with voice-acted cut scenes which can be entertaining.  While the graphics don't really exploit the system, they work well for the game.  Overall, for the price, especially if you can get it on sale, it is a good purchase for the PS4."

135653,5,"One of my first thoughts after getting my wii fit was that Nintendo should have charged a little more and included a rechargeable battery pack.  This unit fulfills that duty perfectly.

I'd prefer for it to have a regular AC adapter  so I could charge the balance board while storing it under my couch, but the usb connector is not so inconvenient.

The battery pack integrates perfectly into the existing battery compartment and the quality is what I'd expect if nintendo included a battery pack of their own.  Well done."

450876,5,Great item thanks
207838,5,"When I bought our Wii, I bought a two station charger that required sliding the wiimotes down into slots.  It was a huge pain because the gel case had to be removed and the strings for the wrist strap could get in the way of the charging contacts.  It was always a long process of getting everything removed then wiggling the wiimotes in the holder until the blue light came on to show that they were charging.  The fit wasn't perfect so anyone could bump the charger and they'd quit charging.

The Energizer flat panel charger made all this just go away.  We just lay the wiimote on top and that's it.  The little light comes on and turns green when charging is done.  We can charge all 4 remotes at the same time and it's just fantastic as remotes don't get left lying around uncharged because fitting them into the charger was too much hassle.

All our wiimotes are made by nintendo, I guess those made by other manufacturers won't work but I can't speak to that as we don't have the issue.  I just know this is an awesome product for our family that has made the issue of remotes going dead in the middle of a game a problem that has just gone away.  I love it."
477173,5,"Blur is an interesting game that is sort of like a Mario kart with real cars. It is an interesting concept that has kept me entertained for many races while shooting projectiles at nearby cars and leaving bombs behind for other racers to fall for is quite fun. The cars are also nice.  Fun game, enough said."
13606,5,This rumble pak is a very neat idea to add to the games. Bad thing is it only works on some games. Check the red bar on the right of the package for the games to see if it says rumble pak. Good thing if it does because it is very fun when it vibrates like when you get tackled in NFL blitz or wrestled in WWF no mercy. It will be tons of fun. ENJOY!!!
376626,5,"Very cool keyboard, I love everything about it, one bonus the package had a sticker free digital copy of the division for PC? Wow that was a nice bonus that not even the stores had? Make it even more of a value"

241499,5,"Hard to believe so much could be improved from Forza 3, but the group at Turn 10 has done it.  This games best changes in my opinion are a more accurate cockpit POV, more realistic graphics/lighting, and a better visual representation of speed, meaning 150 MPH looks VERY different from 200 MPH and so on.  The only downside I have been able to notice is the poor engine sound diversity.  Almost all of the cars sound identical when you start making any modifications and even in stock trim most of the cars sound the exact same.  This of course, is a small sticking point for a game that has once again shown it is easily the best racing sim available.

As for the VIP pack, I would say choose wisely.  There are many individuals buying these at HUGE mark ups.  I would never pay $30+ over the standard.  Keep in mind that every car pack, like in Forza 3, will eventually come to XBOX Live.  I bought this Limited Edition because I wanted the book and the instant downloads, but if you have patience and can wait until the car packs start coming you will be find ordering the stock edition."

47711,5,"There are some things I liked about this game and some things I didn't.  One thing I didn't like was Sims 2 added an aging feature, but you can get around this using the cheat ctrl+shift+c, which I don't exactly think of as a cheat as in The Sims Deluxe Edition aging wasn't included.  Actually having aging in Sims 2 makes it more rushed & harder in my opinion.  I just picked this game up a few days ago and I like it very much, but added fun comes when you start playing expansions, which I will cover later.  One thing about Sims 2 was there is desires & fears and as you complete these desires you can get or lose points to get rewards.  Another thing I didn't like was the criminal factor.  In Sims Deluxe Edition if you install an alarm in your home and a thief comes, the alarm goes off and the thief gets arrested.  In Sims 2 a fight breaks out between the cop and the thief so the chances are 50/50 if the crook will actually be arrested.  If not the sign pops up ""next time thief"".  Which if you have a lot of high end stuff in your home and a crook breaks in, unless you can replace what they steal beforehand it you'll probably end up losing it.  Sims do wake up faster so you can wake up and call the police even if you don't have an alarm so that part is good.  All in all it's a great game.  Recommended."

360238,5,"***UPDATE 03/19/2015***
Still having a great time in multiplayer, everything feels so smooth except for driving. To me, driving just feels clunky, sport cars certainly have an awful turning radius. Flying helicopters is a blast. I found that if you can't gun an enemy down on a fly by, smash him with a quick landing! I find it more fun to try and smash enemies than to actually shoot them now.

I have rarely any connection issues. I have on occasion, been kicked from the game during a new map cycle. But I have been able to play full games with zero lag and no drop in connection.

The spawning is still as bad as it's always been. Even when I am not spawning on a teammate in action, I am spawned somewhere on a flag where a vehicle just ""HAPPENS"" to be driving in the neighborhood and runs me down.

The machine gun on the helicopters vs the machine gun mounted on and armored car baffles me. The armored car's mounted gun is far superior than that of support and attack helicopters, and I'm not even talking about upgrades here. I have used both, stock, and I can far more easily take down a group of Charlies than I can with the weak guns on the choppers.

The stingers seems to lock on way to quickly, or there is a delayed cockpit warning that you are being locked on. I swear it feels like as soon as a stinger even readies, its already being fired.

Anyways, I have yet to go through campaign yet and will be continuing to update this as I go. So far for the multiplayer....LOVE IT!

***RELEASE DAY 03/17/2015 FIRST ENTRY***

This will be a review that I will continue to update as time goes on but here's what I have to say about it.

Battlefield Hardline in itself is very fun and very involving. Speaking from a multiplayer standpoint, what you do will effect the whole team. If you get lazy and don't play the objective in games like ""Hotwire"" and ""Heist,"" your team will be very upset at you and as a whole, are bound for failure. BFHL offers unique objective game types that parallel the more common game types with a twist that essentially make them a whole new genre.

(Example) Hotwire is essentially a capture the flag game type. The twist, the flag is completely mobile and must remain so, there is no capture point, and your flag can be used as a weapon or it can be a death cage on wheels for you and your teammates.

On another note, I would classify this game as an expansion to the series. I feel like its a breathe of fresh air as it offers more urbanized warfare and not vast amount of desserts like previous battlefield titles, giving a bit of rest until the next Battlefield game is released. It also brings the feeling of chaos closer to home as the terrain is more familiar and the modern trends of our industrialization brings a blissful joy.

I have yet to completely dig deep into this game as it has just been released, but I will continue to update as I go along."
448918,5,First the one star reviews are all complaints on sellers and old games that seem to need cleaning not true game reviews i don't like this version because of the new characters they are wack... But street fighter is awesome game
20578,5,Well if you own a Phat PS2 This is a must for HDD mode simple as that and still running ;)
270705,5,"Ugh.... obvious point-out aside. I had a feeling that Zook would be a fun character to play (and NOT just because he's a walking, Rastafarian-accented, bamboo guy with a bamboo bazooka.), over all, he's a decently reliable far-range-attack Skylander, a few notches down from Flameslinger and Gill Grunt. He also has MIRV mortars which allow an elevated attack (with a pineapple missile, lol), and he ""grows"" a barrier to slow down oncoming enemies, making him more effective at KEEPING his enemies far. His speed is good, but his armor and attack lack a bit (at first, until you boost with with challenges).

His tactics.... along WITH being a reggae plant-man with an awesome, somewhat scruffy face with a big toothy grin... makes him a worthy add-on to your Skylander cast."
156642,5,Love it
111884,5,"I can't put this game down. I loved the original Tactics on PS1 over 10 years ago and it still holds up. There are some slight differences, all the cities have different names, some of the Lucavi have different names too. If you don't know about the game play, it's turn-based panel style. This version also has the Dark Knight class which is freaking awesome. Also, to unlock certain jobs the level prerequisites are higher, some abilities cost more JP. You can see the differences laid out very well on the Tactics Wikia."
63341,5,"This is truly one of the greatest games of our time. The only RPGs that have pulled me in the way that this one has before are FF VII, Skies of Arcadia and the Shining Force Series. This is as deep an RPG as you'll find. There is a ton of reading, a lot of cut scenes and in all honesty, huge loading times, but those things are to be expected with a top notch RPG. Lush visuals, fantastic music and sounds, great voice acting and a story that really grows on you. Your decisions have an impact in the outcome. My wife even loves this game and she *hates* almost every game it seems. Definitely buy this. I would recommend the Limited Edition for the added character and style."

185070,5,"First of all, I've gotta state I'm a big FF fan but I'll try to keep the review as free of bias as possible.

PROS

-tons of fun
-awesome graphics
-the fact it's a portable game
-MOST of my favorite FF characters are present

CONS

-weak storyline
-game difficulty towards the end may get frustrating
-easy to learn but hard to master
-if you wanna complete the game 100% it may get repetitive

Detailed review
Alright,so I started looking forward to this game long before it came out but I didn't get around to buy it until late 2010. It was worth the wait and I was able to get it for a great price.
It won't dissapoint those looking for the perfect FF fighting game. The fights are very reminiscent of what you see in Advent Children. Plus, you get to tally your favorite characters and villians. There is also plenty of references to all FF games and it manages to keep an FF feel to it. Another great plus in being able to see those characters from old NES, SNES and PS1 era games with updated looks to match today's PSP's graphic capabilities. There is a lot of atention to detail.
The big dissadvantages I found were the severe weakness of the storyline. It's actually nowhere near innovative, and rather empty under FF standards. Don't expect to see much character development or to learn much about your characters. in fact at times it even seems like the story is happening in a completely unrelated time and world where all of them just happen to be, with no connection whatsoever to their respective stories and endings according to the games they each come from. Moreover, some characters even display completely different personalities from their originals and whatever they learned in their quests seems to be neglected. Squall, to mention one, acts like he does at the beginning of FF8 where he is still a emotionless loner.

So anyway, the game is great, it's worth the $$$ you're guaranteed to have fun and 10x fun is you're an FF fan, but treat it solely as a cool fighting game with cool rpg elements, not as a FF epic"

19724,5,"If you loved Shadow of the Colossus, you owe it to your self to play this title. Very well designed with challenging puzzles. I still play this game occasionally on my PS3.

If you have a PS2 or PS3, you HAVE to give this game a try.

Also, the game ""Shadow of the Colossus"" is also very good and follows the series."

103989,5,Perfecto
453153,5,"It was a great game. I'd lost this game at the 99 Cent Store as a kid along with my Gameboy. Recently, I'd remembered scenes from the game, and I searched them up, and I couldn't remember if it was Megaman Battle Network 1 or 3 I'd had as a kid. Then I remembered! It was both. After I lost 1, I saw 3 and thought it was the same game. It wasn't, and though I was disappointed, I wasn't after having played 3.

But, I digress. As a kid, I'd never beaten this game (because I'd lost it). Having had the ame for a few weeks, I can finally say I beat the game, and yeah. I love this game a lot. What are you waiting for?! Buy it!"
289313,5,I was looking for a good but not to expensive gaming headset and I found it with the Logitech g230 they sound great and the mic works great
265511,5,ok
455187,5,I love the city builder series and this is a holy grail compilation for me. I love these games and they were a big part of my childhood so it's great to have them all.
344391,5,I spent a forever looking for something to carry my Xbox one when I travel and found this. It is perfect. Everything fits inside and I'm not worried about anything breaking. I would definitely recommend this to other people.
3114,5,"Here it is, final fantasy seven, the seventh installment of one of the greatest franchises. This piece of art is one of my favorites and chills my soul and memories like no other, like a dark adventure of spooky fantasy and introspective sorrow, a lasting impression i won't forget. The one that got me into the franchise. from the environments of steam punk, industrial fantasy to the structures of imagined forests to it's direction and haunting yet hopeful premise, this adventure rocks. it goes into topics of self identities, dealing with losses, truths and corruption,  this final dark illusive fantasy will leave you in shock, wonder and discovery. it's story is a grand dark and light one of sorrow, hope and illusions. the story reminds me of the teen days of emotions and pressure. The music by nobuo is one of his best, if not the best to me. It's loaded with soaring melodic orchestra with electronic sounds and some rock. the battle system is amazing too. you gather orbs of materia that you can mix with others. If you add all with a magic it will cast it to all enemies. You have a limit break gauge that builds up from attacks, when you have enough points, you can use one of many cool looking animated moves.  a eye opener of reality and self. they say video games aren't educational but they are, especially this one and all the final fantasies. It is one of my biggest inspirations."
199524,5,This is an awesome game...literally.  Every time I pick up the controls the game is still fun to play...great job
427238,5,I have been waiting for this game for a while and it was well worth the wait. It fights more like a DragonBall game than Tekken. My only real complaint is that you're more or less forced to use the gamepad screen when playing against a friend. I prefer jusy sharing the tv screen. The fighting seems pretty solid and characters seem well balanced.
147710,5,"This game is a masterpeice to me. It has some amazing graphics compared to other 360 games, the voice acting is great and the enviorment is beautiful! Even if your just running thourgh the sewers, there is something strangly calming and peacful to Me about this game, It's not scary AT ALL, but it's still wonderful. I enjoyed replaying the levels with Chris and Sheva, and just fell in love with Sheva Alomor. It's so good to see a Resident evil game that finally has an African American Woman, a gorgeous one with a awsome accent at that, and best of all, She DOESN'T die at the end of the game! Verses mode is alot of fun and Wesker's leather costum is amazing, probobly the best thing he's ever worn. I highly recommend this game."
81199,5,Great game linked with the story line of Final Fantasy.
290804,5,"I pre-ordered this game back at Holiday break, I got one-day shipping on it and on the release day as I presumed it was on my doorstep when I came home. I'll tell you I went to play this game at about 3:30 PM, I stopped at about 3:30 AM, because I forced myself to go to bed! This is one of those games where you instantly fall in love with it the second your hands touch the controller. The story and characters in this game is fantastic and never gets old, the free roam type setting lets you pick what kind of karma you want to use for your powers in the game, Bad or Good. I prefer good because you get a lot more cool powers than Bad karma. I enjoyed a lot of moments in the game, such as using the touch pad to unlock doors to free prisoners, suck smoke into your arm as a power and busting drug and gang leaders. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes free roam games and solving quests along the main story. Just an awesome game!"
99355,5,"Criterion has changed the Burnout franchise for the best. Instead of the dated linear approach they have created something new for their franchise. And if you don't judge it on just the demo and play the real game you will understand how much better this approach is than the original games. Rent this game if you have doubts, buy this game if you like racing game."

395193,5,"Fun game, not to much different than other Call Of Duty games, aside from the jump boost and some of the scopes. Zombies is a blast"
113884,5,"The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night is one of the better playstation 2 Spyro games out there. Most people don't like it because it is not like the older playstation games. The graphics look very good for the playstation 2. The game has celebrity voices like Elijah Wood as Spyro, Billy West as Sparx, and Gary Oldman as Ignitus. You can upgrade your breath attacks just like A New Beginning.  The breath attacks you have is fire, ice, earth, and electricity. You have many combo moves to take on the many creatures you will fight. You can also slow down time temporarily. I really like this new Spyro game. I really reccommend this game to people who like the Spyro games.  This game is rated E10+ for cartoon violence and comic mischief."
224399,5,product works as intended.  Makes certain moves easier to input.  Super easy to install.
369159,5,Very awesome that they made another game honestly I can recommend this to anyone that wants a good game

130606,5,"This is another game in the series but it takes a little different turn. Graphics are different also and gameplay is a little bit darker but at the core of it, its still a great strategy game and I had fun playing it."
468654,5,got the game fast shipping absolutely love it Any of the medal of armor or History Channel Games like this are worth getting
5340,5,"What a weird game this is. It had been gathering dust in my closet for at least a year untill I sort of felt in the mood for playing it. This was because the content seemed a bit bloody, but most of all because the controls seemed annoying. You have to move your character by holding the right mousebutton all the time, and that doesn't relieve you of any slumbering RSI.
But what a challenging and hauntingly beautiful game this turned out to be! The puzzles are very well integrated into the story, but it is foremost the story itself that earns the five stars. You have to wander through several worlds that are so very, very weird they will stretch your imagination to the limit. The plot unfolds itself nicely, and will keep surprising you.
Some of the worlds (or dreams, or visions, or whatever) took getting used to, but how rewarding it all was. The story will keep you awake, and follow you in months to come after you've finished Sanitarium.
On the graphics side, well, they are a bit outdated, but they are still eyecandy. An amazing colourpalette is used, it just looks great. The cutscenes are black and white, just in keep with the atmosphere of the game.
And there's the humour. This game had me laughing out loud many times, quite a feat sonsidering the gory content of the game. Although gory, well, it's not for the fainthearted. Imagine having to push a corpse in an oven to be able to solve a puzzle... But is is always done with wit.
Sanitarium is a masterpiece, both in concept and in content. It ranks right up there with my other alltime favourits like Myst, Riven, Journeyman Project 3 and Beyond Atlantis."

169356,5,"Great game, great idea for a gift. Historically from a legendary saga. Entertains and causes you longing for those days when you were playing on the NES."
154542,5,"many years ago, ""age of empires"" introduced me to the power the PC games have to take a gamer through history or simulate historical events ... i was in total awe of that game at the time.  fortunately, as years passed, i was rewarded with the multitude of PC games that centered around my favorite historical event ... World War II.

although most of my entire video game catalogue consists of WWII shooters like the MoH, CoD and BIA series, i have found that once the single-player facet was completed i focused solely on multiplayer ... only to find myself getting bored with the same old maps, cheaters and everyone using the most powerful weapon available.  i tried the demo for Company of Heroes years ago, but thought it was too much for my computer memory to handle and passed on purchasing it back then.

a short while ago i saw that the original game had 2 expansions, decided to give it a try (my computer can now handle it) and purchase the gold edition (which contains the first 2 tiles) and the latest expansion (tales of valor) ... i was more than pleased.  this game took me back to the thrill that i first experienced with ""age of empires"".  obviously, technology has generated much better graphics and improved gameplay than AOE, but the experience of going back in history and ""experiencing"" world war II with such realisim is what won me over.  the game does a great job in maintaining some sort of historical accuracy while making the gameplay balanced and fun.

i thought the graphics were great, the gameplay was smooth and the missions were challenging (with some being quite difficult and frustrating) ... i feel this game, with possible future expansions and a loyal mod/mapping community make it an entertainment investment that could keep me occupied on a long term basis without getting bored ... something that is hard to do w/ video games IMHO.

the gold edition of CoH (getting 2 games in one) is a great bargain as well."
72445,5,"Recently I bought Pirates for my son who is now at the age where he can enjoy computer games more and who has shown great interest in anything pertaining to pirates.  Originally,  I was going to play the game myself without high expectations of enjoying the game and then show him how to play.  However, I've enjoyed the game a great deal!

There are five levels of difficulty, ranging from Apprentice to Swashbuckler and certain skills (fencing, medicine, romance, etc.) your pirate can possess.

Your pirate is able to earn ""fame"" scores through: promotions, wealth attained, pirates defeated, enemies avenged, pirate treasures recovered, and perhaps other means too.

The graphics are great and another good thing about the game is that your strategy is open-ended based on what you want to be (a romantic, plunderer, wealth accumulator, etc.).

Highly recommeded for both kids and adults (sometimes as in my case it may be hard to differentiate which one I may be when it comes to fun games!).  The game manual is extremely well-written and very helpful!!!

Play and enjoy yet another great title by Sid Meier.

By the way Sid, when will you make some other Civil War real time games and make your Gettysburg game compatible with Windows Vista?"
402860,5,Best game ever!!!
100342,5,"I'm not a fanatic over the Shrek movie series, but they are fun to watch.  This one feels like you are actually playing a part in the movie!  The MULTIPLAYER PARTY GAMES are the best!

400627,5,"Need for Speed for my PlayStation 4 has been a very fun game. I played through the whole game and had its platinum in less than two weeks. The storyline is fun, the handling the vehicles get are good, the options for adding aftermarket parts are extensive, and the game as a whole, is just a lot of fun. Even after you beat the game there's a Prestige mode, things to find and collect, and several other things. Is it the best Need for Speed ever? Probably not. Like most hardcore fans, I'm gonna have to give that title to the original (2005) version of Most Wanted. However, it is still a GREAT game."

48911,5,"Mario is back in this newest accrual to the World of Nintendo, but there's a new face in the Mushroom Kingdom. In addition to all your favorite characters - Princess Toadstool, Bowser, Yoshi, and everyone else - Mario Mario's equally Italian-sounding brother, Luigi Mario, has finally made an appearance. The much anticipated Luigi has always been spoken of and conceptualized by fans of the games, but only now do we see his true identity. Much like a mixture of Mario and Waluigi, Luigi wears the color scheme of green with blue overalls, an inverse to Mario's red. This plumber also sports a green cap with the letter ""L"" adorned on the front as a means of further identification. Don't think Luigi is just like Mario, however - they might be genetically affiniates, but Luigi appears both taller and skinnier in figure. Luigi has brown hair with black eyebrows and moustache. Logistically, Luigi has the ability to jump higher than Mario, however Mario is in many situations easier to control. This makes the two comparatively equal in overall manuverability, but I'm sure some will make a choice as to which character they ultimately prefer.

Luigi Mario is full of his own idiosyronous personality traits. He is said to be more nervous and cowardly than his brother, which explains his extended absence from the ironically-titled Mario Bros games. With his wavery, nasal voice and shifty footwork, nothing is funnier than this absurd Italian co-star. Finally Nintendo has granted the world a chance to play as BOTH Mario brothers, and there are even places in this game where Luigi takes the limelight as sole playable character.

What are you waiting for?"

76546,5,"Galactic Civilizations 2 has great graphics, very nice sound, and most importantly it is both fun and everything is very smooth.

You ever play a game by Blizzard Entertainmet?  If you have then you know what I'm talking about when I say everything runs smoothly.

But Galactic Civilizations 2 is cutting edge in the area of Turn-Based Space-Strategy.  It is very much like Civilization but instead of running a single planet you are the President/King/ect. of an entire space civilization doing your very best to protect it from the other races and guide it to victory.

The AI is as smart or as dumb as you want it to b and one of my FAVORITE features is you get to DESIGN your OWN SHIPS!  YES!  So if you want to remake StarWars and have the humans all be Evil Imperials conquering the Galaxy with the Death Star and their Star Destroyers, THEN SO BE IT!  Yes, you heard me, YOU CAN BUILD A DEATH STAR!  HA!

There is a depth to this game that shows that the creators are serious sci-fi strategy fans and probably have played all of the  turn based strategy games themselves before designing this game.

In short, this game has everything you like about turn based strategy and none of what you don't.  Everything is seemless and yet you are still in charge of everything at the same time.

Lastly, the game while very complex is not very difficult to learn because the AI has easy to read suggestions about everything and if you are guiding your civilization the wrong way the AI will sometimes jokingly/seriously 'suggest' things you could do better.  =-)"

162275,5,"So I got this game the 18th of may and have put in some solid time on the game in multiple classes before making this review. The game was bought by both me and my wife as anniversary gifts for each other. Currently this game is my only blizzard product in my house I would not consider my self their fan boy or beat writer in any way shape or form. Due to purchasing the game after the initial server stutters and DOS attacks on blizzards servers I have a game that for me has performed flawlessly on blizzards end. I did some research before hand and found out the game would be only on line which for me was no draw back it would be just like playing COD online or any multiplayer shooter online for me. That being said I truthfully prefer single player games over multiplayer games,I think games like Planescape torment, Baldur's gate and any of the elder scrolls are ultimately more fulfilling video game experiences in the scheme of things. So now that I have laid the mortar for the foundation of my review let me begin.

Sound, the music and sound effects in this game are very well done, Blizzard has a good track record for good music and sound in games, the voices weren't amazing for some characters but it didn't ruin the experience in any way shape or form, the music however did put a nice level of ambience into the game.

Graphics- to me the least important factor in any game, that being said blizzard did a great job on the graphics of the game, the level of detail to the environments is pretty stunning and unseen for the isometric view in games today. Each area has its own style and is very unique, for the most part the environments manage to be unique throughout the game and each act has its own art style. I loved the way they did the environments for the abyss areas the best they didn't get my personal image of hell perfectly but it did look great like tromping around inside the desicated carcass of a demonic beast. The character models to me were generic yet still managed to be well done though should not have truly been the focus of an isometric view game. My only ding for the graphics of the game were the inability to change the view point in the game or adjust the camera. I can understand that for many games this can create bugs for abilities or transparent environments so for me not a huge deal.

Story-The story was generic and predictable to me it was like any other action RPG game though as far as storyline goes I wouldn't be playing an action RPG if that's what I wanted. Let's be honest everyone knew exactly what was going to happen in this game, diablo was going to be in the game and the brave heroes were going to kill diablo any one who didn't know something like that wasn't going to happen probably should have looked elsewhere for a game. That being said I did like some of the characters in the game, specifically Shen he is the best character in the game by far, his dialogue is funny and a good change up in the game.

Gameplay- Now folks this is where the meat and potatoes of this genre come into play, Diablo 3 does exceptionally well when it comes to aspect of controls and gameplay mechanics. Alot of people have had problems with the game being click based, its a computer what did you expect you would be using a crystal ball. Anyways each one of the classes in the game plays very different and is unique to the other classes in the game. The rune system was fantastic and very well implemented its unlike any of the other systems I have seen in games I would say what I like most about the system is that encourages multiple play styles, so though you may have the exact same character as another person you aren't forced into a niche to play that character a certain way. I love the multiplayer component for the game, I love having friends drop into my game and it increasing the challenge and increasing the loot that drops I think the way Blizzard implemented that service was flawless and went without a hitch. For this game the gameplay is its strong point, it is fun exciting and entertaining, I have logged over a 100 hours into this game on several characters both me and my wife still play it together on our shared internet connection. Just to explain our internet is not top of the line its standard cable internet connection and just runs us 30 dollars a month. Also for people are dissatisfied with instant allocation of skill points and talents change the game to elective mode in game play options.

Overall I think that this game is a solid step in the right direction. I barely played diablo 1 and 2 so I didn't lofty and unrealistic expectations for this game. I hope more games go the only online route, as a matter of fact I hope that hard copies of games disapear for ever and the middle man gets cut out of the gaming industry, that should reduce the price of games because as it stands now as the third world countries these discs are made in get a higher standard of living, these games we love will increase in prices. DRM is the way of the future unfortunately, producers have been burned by us as players and this is a result. I love this game and I am going to play it right now. This is my opinion on this game. I know there are people that literally camp the forums I was debating on making a review because of this, Im talking to you gary Uber troll."
339178,5,quite an interesting game haven't played much of it yet but it looks pretty good so far. Not sure it is for everyone but if you like RPGs give it a try

12531,5,"Pokemon Stadium is a Pokemon fighting game for the Nintendo 64--not an adventure game like Red/Blue/Yellow or anything like that.  In this game, you fight through different tournaments with your Pokemon, and once you beat everything, you unlock a ""Round-2"" mode--which I unfortunately don't know much about, since I have yet to unlock it.

You can either use ""rental"" Pokemon in the tournaments, or you can upload them from your Game Boy games utilizing a device called the ""Transfer Pak"".

You can only upload Pokemon from the Red, Blue and Yellow versions, however, because this game predates Gold, Silver, Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire and anything from then on.  Also, with a cartridge in the Transfer Pak, you can do different things like trade Pokemon (if there's a second controller, Transfer Pak and Game Boy cartridge plugged in), check out their stats at Professor Oak's Laboratory, and play the game on the television using a thing called ""GB (Game Boy) Tower"".

WARNING WARNING WARNING: I, personally, do not recommend using Game Boy Tower, because it erased my Pokemon Yellow game when I tried it.  Something went kerflooey when I tried to save my progress.

Also, if you upload Pikachu from a Yellow cartridge and you use him without registering him, he'll say his name.  This I found to be a nice touch, and I wondered why ALL the Pokemon didn't do this to begin with.

Where Pokemon Stadium is concerned, the pros vastly outnumber the cons, but it might be prudent of me to list them anyway, so here they are:

The game can be very frustrating, specifically where the Pika Cup tournament is concerned.  I still can't beat the darn thing.

There is an announcer who comments on the battling.  Although it's an interesting touch, some may find him annoying (I don't, really, but I felt it should've been listed).  Fortunately, if he gets on your nerves, you can turn him off in the Options menu.

To conclude, I will say that Pokemon Stadium is a really nice game, and I recommend it.  However, if you are rather young or sensitive, you may find it a tad disturbing (even though the characters just faint; they don't ever die)."

72165,5,"I got this game for my son (4 years old).  He loves Dora and he loves playing video games.  All I had to do was turn this on for him and he did everything else!

This game is very age appropriate.  As Dora is walking around the different planets, there are choices for the child to make.  Either walk along the paths or find crystals and other hidden goodies.  This makes it interesting for the kid who's playing instead of just a boring walk here and there.  But it's not too complex that you can get lost.

The game guides you where to go so the player always feels successful and accomplished.  It requires some thinking and problems solving skills where you pick up items and have to figure out where to use them.

My son made it from Earth to the Purple Planet in several sessions which kept him entertained for a while.  The saving feature is very nice so the kids can play for 15 to 20 minutes at a time without having to go back.

There should be more games like this for preschool age children!  Anyone who loves Dora or playing video games will love this one.  A must have for the holidays!"
55117,5,"samurai warriors is a hard game. i beat 2 of the stories, yukimura's and the samurai's tale. the highest rank is a twenty. you might want to have 2 people when you're doing story mode. if one of you is a 1 and the other is an 18 you might want have backup. 2 player mode is cool because you go into a mode and just kill everyone in sight. you can also create a charecter. you can have up to 5 people and use them in story mode. you want to be on nobunaga's because his excircises or easier than the other lords, like shingen. that guy dies for god sake. if you like dynasty warriors you'll like this."

453076,5,"Tony Hawk, Skate or Die, Grind Session...these are the games that come to mind when I think of PS2 skate games. But, of course ESPN needed to have something to boost the hype. Real players, real areas, real musicians. That's how a skate game is made to be. Konami did not disappoint with this particular game. One might call it a masterpiece while some might say it's a piece of somethin else. But in all, the game is a variant from the others out there. It helps to get out of your THPS comfort zone and get your mind working like a real skateboarder (plus, you have to use gravity as a variable in this game)."

169588,5,"Jedi Alliance - great title and It has a bit of a story that we haven't heard before.  A bit of figuring stuff out.  And a bit of a challenge, but not too hard. Buy it for a young star wars fan...it should not disappoint.  Like the series, it is kid oriented. I like all the stylus action, I like  the reading.  Good buy, for the DS.  Something closer to this for the wii would be welcome. Graphics are fine, music is not annoying. If you have a kid begging for it I'd say buy it. There are a lot worse games out there.

On a final note it is, of course, not as good as Lego Star Wars which you should buy first!

My 8 year old son LOVES it.  My daughter loves to watch."

475238,5,"AND now, Mega Man 10 is coming out! Keep them coming! MM 9 is a fascinating sequel to a stunning series, play today!

Also, if you like retro games, check out Retro Gamer Magazine. The price is a little high for a magazine, but they go for like 60 bucks an issue on ebay,
so I recommend a subscription. Great stuff! It's definitely the best thing I've seen that's dedicated to older games and the games and systems of
yesteryear.

5 stars for Mega Man 9 and 5 stars for Retro Gamer Magazine.

Highly recommended!"

Great gameplay, great story, the landscapes are fantastic in HD, everything looks gorgeous. They kept scene skipping (not that I'm doing that much, since they look amazing), and they took away that incessant You got a blue rupee notification you got every single time you started the game up and found one. The same goes for yellow, red, purple, silver, and orange rupees.

281148,5,"My slim 120GB PS3 is partially broken.  The dual layer for blu-ray doesn't work, but the single layer part does.  I can play games that are single layer, but the double layer games just keep trying to load.  I bought this PS3 bundle and it is the best value.  The price came down and it is the new super slim version.  The only thing I didn't like is the manual loading of the disc.  The auto loading of the disc found in the older generations of PS3 is better.  This is a minor inconvenience.  I think the design was set this way to lower the cost of manufacturing and thus lower the price sold to consumers.  And of course this bundle comes with 2 games and a remote on top of the standard package.  The only thing you need to get separately is the stand, which I ordered.  I recommend getting the stand to allow your PS3 to be vertical for better cooling.  The bottom of the PS3 is where all the heat builds up from.  So having the PS3 stand up will allow it to cool better than it sitting flat and trapping the heat."

70055,5,"I am new to the Advance Wars series and just picked up a used copy of this game.  Of note... if you want to clear all save data (using DSI XL) then hold L, Select, and right on the control pad while STARTING the game and it will load up and ask to clear all data.  The instructions were written for the old DS system).

Being new to this series, I have not had the opportunity to play the previous games and so the characters, story, and, well, everything is new.  The game makes a nice point of separating itself from previous games.  You really don't need all of the back story since most of the characters are treated as being new (they are new to your commanders at least), so you get to learn about them as you play.  Since this story is set in a distant land from the previous titles, you really don't need that connection of story lines.

The campaign mode starts slow and the missions are rather easy at first.  You don't really need to read the manual, but it is nice to scan through.  Some of the tutorials are rather vague about what some units do or what they are effective against.

Around the 8th mission or so things begin to get more interesting.  Despite being my first time playing AW, I was grabbing S rank on many of the first missions. Later missions I was regularly struggling to finish off the more persistent enemy COs.  There are later missions where you have a finite number of units and once they're gone, they're gone.  Other maps you can build and create units.  Again this is in Campaign mode).

I also enjoyed that many of the maps require different tactics to win.  Not every map has the 'kill all enemies' victory requirement.  Some maps will have you taking out specific units, or capturing the enemy base, or destroying a particular fortress.

The music changes based on what commanding officer is currently controlling the action.  Each ally and enemy has a unique score.  Some are more mellow, others more intense.  I like the variety though.  I could see many players choosing their favorite COs based on the music (I kind of did!).

The enemy AI is actually pretty smart most of the time.  This makes for a good challenge, without the AI being 'cheap'.  Instead it seems the AI will select effective units to use against your units.  They don't seem to send infantry to attack your tank units too often...

The real treat with this game is all of the amazing additional content.  There is the online wifi vs mode of course.  But there is a mode where you can battle the computer AI on a number of pre-made maps.  The best extra is the ability to create your own maps and then battle on those.  You get combat points to spend in the shop where you can buy extra maps and COs to use in these extra modes (as well as to change their clothes/hair color if you want).

I have only been playing for about 8 to 10 hours so far (mission 18), but I plan to continue updating this review as I progress deeper into the game.  But so far I can see many happy hours spent playing.  And then I can't wait to open up my copy of AW4 Days of Ruin!"

365480,5,"Monolithsoft has done it again by combining Western RPG concepts and classic JRPG tropes.

* As with the original Xenoblade Chronicles, the true star of the game is the absolutely stunning world. Spectacular, impossible landscapes and brilliantly imagined alien lifeforms are everywhere, backed by excellent music.
* The quest system is improved, removing the need to grind for rare item drops and adding and map markers that tell you where you need to go to find particular enemies and NPC's.
* The game gives the player complete freedom of exploration, with the entire world map unlocked from the beginning.
* The combat system is very well-designed, keeping the best elements of the Xenoblade Chronicles system and adding more.

The game does have some flaws:
* There are too many party members, which results in many characters seeming flat and underdeveloped.
* The plot becomes unimaginative and predictable.
* For those who want to go through the postgame to achieve 100% completion, the postgame content is a tedious grindfest.
* The ""cute"" cartoony mascot is very irritating. This may play in well Japan but it doesn't work for Anglosphere audiences."

71656,5,"This game has been with me for about a month now, I played as Demoness, found the adventure quite interesting,
and the skill progression very informative and effective. The game is quite addictive, never a dull moment,
there is always some adversary to fight, loot to collect and compare with already equipped things, magically
hidden (don't show even with Alt pressed unless mouse cursor on them) stashes.
There are save slots (3 of them) where you can save (and load from) at various stages, when you think it prudent.
I prefer this way rather than automatic ""Save and Exit"" type of saving (like in Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, or Fate),
where there is essentially only ONE saved game: if you choose, for example, to upgrade one skill,
and this turns out to be not the best idea, Sacred: Gold allows you to load one of your previous versions,
granting you a ""redo"" of sort, no such luck with the ""Save and Exit"" saving type.
The quest compass, pointing to main (story line) quests, as wel as to currently active side quest, is a nice feature, as the Sacred world is vast. A detailed account is kept of monsters vanquished.
Overall, a very well-made role-playing game, I am very pleased with Sacred Gold edition."

255254,5,"Well, It works! No bells and whistles here, but it works. It feels a bit cheaper then the original controllers but they've been dropped, kicked, slammed and thrown already and still are holding up! So 5 stars it is!

Con: The cord is pretty short... Like a little more the a Foot shorter then the original controllers... and that sucks

Also, Has withstood many beers being spilt on them During Smash Bros. Id say 100% with the buy if you need 1 or 2.

Great for people who, have kids or... Backpack it to partys to kick Smash Bros face with drunk ppl...

Its like the difference between using regular plates when its just you and breaking out the fine china for company, Only the other wat around! Cause they aint touching my Fine China!"

355213,5,"A really stylish Wii Remote, It's the same as any Wii Remote just with a really nice style to give a nice look verse the simple plain all white or black remote. Anyone looking for a stylish Wii Remote should check this 1 out."
36530,5,"This is not a game for the weak of heart. Or a game for crappy computers. If you want to play Doom 3, but don't have a decent graphics card, get an X-Box or buy a new graphics card.

Like every other review, I'm going to comment on the graphics. Holy crap. This game is the epitaph of graphic prowess. The lighting, shadows, effects, bump mapping, physics engine, AI, weapons designs, and creatures are truly top notch.

The story is simple: Hell has broken loose on Mars, luckily for you, you aren't affected by the demon outbreak. You have just arrived on Mars, this is an unfamiliar facility, good luck finding your way around.

Basically, this game gives what nearly all FPS fans want: Run and gun with an interesting backdrop. That's right, there are a few ""find a key"" moments, but other than that, you fight through hordes of demons to get to another plot point (EG a CGI Cinema).

The weapons loadout is really neat, I love that the Doom creators added a regular machine gun in addition to the chain gun. But, I hated having to switch between my flashlight and guns when I'm being attacked.

Don't really expect character development for people who really want to ""care"" about the main character. He doesn't have a name (Unless you add one for the PDA's sake), nor does he speak one sentence in the entire game.

Now, the game itself is creepy. You could be walking along listening to the radio transmissions from you slaughtered comerades, suddenly, the lights go out and you have to switch to your flashlight. Then, out of nowhere a demon comes FLYING at you.

My recommendation, if you want to be the least scared, turn on your lights, turn up the brightness, turn off the music, wear a diaper, and go get 'em.

10/10"
371091,5,"I am a fan of Insomniac studio (the same people who created Resistance series on PS3) so even though I couldn't get into this game by watching its trailers, I had to give it a try. I have to say it was nothing like I was expecting and it blew my mind.

****************************************************************************PROS*******************************************************************************
Stylish and fluid gameplay: This is the biggest strength of this game. While difficult at first, I loved the fluid movements you can do in the game. Jump, wall runs and air dash reminded me of Devil may cry. Loved going from one end of the city to another defeating enemies using variety of fun weapons and pulling stylish acrobatic moves.

Fun and colorful weapons: Really loved them. In the beginning you start out with some ok weapons but as you progress through the game you get some really awesome devastating yet funny weapons. Exploding teddy, firecracker gun, hairspray gun etc. are all fun to use to defeat different enemies and the explosion/impact they produce is quite enjoyable.

Variety of enemies and bosses: When I saw the trailer I was worried that I may be just fighting mutants but once you start progressing through the game, you get to face different types of mutants, robots as well as human enemies. It was quite fun using variety of weapons on them. Really enjoyed some of the bosses like frisco bots.

Humorous missions: All and I mean all of the missions in this game are extremely funny. There were times some jokes made me laugh so much that I had to pause the game. Bravo to the creators!

Beautiful open world: Found it quite fun to traverse through the open world of this game. Even when on the missions sometime I would just wonder off as some parts of the town would look quite appealing. Loved jumping to the top of the tall building, surfing on the bodies of water, grinding on the bridge and fighting different enemies in the carnival settings.

Upgrades, perks and collectibles: As if main and side missions were not enough, this game has tons and tons of collectibles that helps you obtain different upgrades and perks.

Online play: Yup in addition to 60+ hrs of missions and side missions there is online play that will unlock more unique weapons.

Replayability; All the missions and side missions are replayable. Loved replaying many of them especially excalimune sword mission. Really fun.

****************************************************************************CONS*******************************************************************************
Learning curve: This game can be difficult at first as controls are a bit novel. But once you get used to them, the game becomes quite fun.

****************************************************************************CONCLUSION*****************************************************************************
Truly hope they make a sequel. I really enjoyed this game. The gameplay was solid and the story was as humorous as I have ever experienced in a video game. I hope I get to experience more in the future. I wouldn't give many games 10/10 but a perfect score for this one. Well done Insomniac."

It was the game that got me into RPG games, But the rest of the phantasy star titles were a let down after playing this one, it holds a place and i will never forget this game!  This is a game that i want to see some kind of update to. It is one of the best rpg games ever made, and is under appreciated. People call this over rated? WHAT? overrated you mean final fantasy 7 was overrated! This game used a comic book style story telling strategy and it worked out and was actually a good compensation to the limits of the sega genesis. I only wished it had more side quests and items to obtain because the end of the game was impossible for me at level 38 or whatever i was by then , had to level up a bit to finish the game. Dont compare it to any other game until you finish it."

It is challenging and whether you are on a horse, on foot, or in a plane, there is a mission to accomplish.  The Early Enlister pack allowed him to get skins, gear packs, and other items that normally would have cost double.  If you are going to play heavy on any Xbox game, get the deluxe editions to save money in the long run.  You not only get so much to start but often the items are discounted or even free when updates occur.  Great game that includes history of WWI."

375528,5,"I have always loved Nintendo since the NES. Nintendo makes up a huge part of my childhood and I have always been biased towards the brand. Nintendo may always be the punchline of many gamers' jokes, but Nintendo brings many great games to the table.

PROS: If you're a fan of vintage gaming, I have two words for you: Backwards Compatability. Sort of.
You can play original Wii games on the Wii U and use Wii controllers to do so. There are also games for sale at a discounted price for purchase online, such as, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario Brothers, etc. Nintendo gives us the opportunity to relive our youth with vintage games available to download.

Graphics have improved dramatically in the Wii U. Nintendo has always put the storyline before graphics and that's what has made the brand consistent in their efforts in creating a game with a story. Nintendo finally gives us a fresh new look at the next generation of gaming in terms of graphics and performance.

CONS: I like and dislike playing with the new controller the Wii U comes with. I hate that it is way too bulky and will easily drain the battery, which is not impressive. When I do play the Wii U, I play with the older controllers if I have the option. The only good that comes out of the controller is that I can play most games on the controller itself, without turning the TV on. There have been times where I would play the Wii U while my wife or son watched TV undisturbed.

Overall, I would recommend you buy this product if you can look past the comparison of graphics to the PS4 and Xbox One. The Wii U is great for vintage gaming and so much more. I will bring more updates if necessary."
445056,5,"This is such a fun game and I am so happy that many of my favorite songs are included.  It's been a while since I have played a Just Dance game and the last time was over five years ago with my Wii. When you first pop the disc into your PS4 there will be a update available but that only took a few minutes to download and install.  I already have a Playstation Camera so I use that to play.  The game comes with some additions when first launching like extra songs if you connect a Uplay account. I passed on that for now.  When first playing it also came with a 2 day pass to Just Dance Unlimited.. Use it or loose it as the first day starts when you install the game.

When you first set up there are different channels you can watch and play. You can watch other people dance on the Just Dance TV and you can even share your finished dances with others or on your own social media. Watching myself dance after I have completed a song is a little gut wrenching as I look like a fool but I will get better and can see the fun with that option.  When I start I go into the Just Dance selection and choose Dance and choose your music. I was shocked to see that previous Just Dance tracks are also available to dance too but then realized that is part of the Unlimited portion that is 4.99 a month or $29.99 for a year. That isn't a bad cost but for now I will have fun with the 44+ songs loaded with Just Dance 2017.

Overall I am having a blast dancing and learning the songs.  I do Zumba normally so the steps aren't that hard to learn what I find annoying is the extra ""dancers"" that will join the dancer you are following when playing. It throws me off but I learn to just pay attention to the main dancer or the previous steps in the bottom right corner..  Also the capture of you dancing at the top in which is how you are scored is a little annoying as for me it's just a big fuzzy blob moving..  But the video afterwords in which I can see myself dancing makes me feel a little better..  I would totally purchase this as I am having so much fun. Will be fun to dance with friends and my nephew and niece it's a great way to get in shape and have fun learning the dances in the privacy of my own home.."
47419,5,"EA has outdone themselves with this game.  Tiger Woods 04 is far and away better than earlier versions.  This game rates a A.  Career Mode is good, building up attributes over time.  Very realistic -  Tiger is almost unbeatable in any mode, but shouldn't he be?  There are many courses to play, many modes, many tournaments and endless addictive fun.  I live in Minnesota and sometimes the only golf we have, well six months at a time, is on the computer.  This game is a good bandaid for those of us stuck in the hinterland, Minnesota.  A

162664,5,"In my opinion Halo Wars is Highly underrated.  I love the Halo Universe, and to experience Halo in a completely different genre was awesome.  Halo Wars takes place many years before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved, and tells the story of the UNSC Spirit of Fire.  The story is captivating, and the multiplayer (in its hay day) was one to enjoy.  I sure hope there will be a Halo Wars 2 on the next gen Xbox One"
32266,5,"I love crazy taxi,im a real big fan of it, I have the first one for gamecube. Then i bought an xbox with 3 games, i didn't buy this one because i didn't know if it was as good or not, so i rented it. WOW, i love this one the most, here are some reasons.
1. Graphics: Really great, they are cartoony graphics sometimes but are really the best.
2. Sound: The sound effects are really cool, and the music, I LOVE, if u like punk bands like offspring and bad religion you'll like this, both bands are in the game plus some band called citizen bird...????.
3. Controls: The controls are the same as the last 2 games, i'd recommend the controller s or the racing wheel for this.
4. Gameplay:I love playing this game. IT has 1 level from each of the 1st games and same characters, I Played this game for hours.
Overall:Crazy Taxi 3 is crazy, i'd recommend buying it, if u never played crazy taxi,(any of them), then i'd recommend u rent it before purchasing. That's All.............Have fun Playing"

Undoubted, COD4 is one of the best shooters that gives PC shooter a new milestone. COD4 has everything you want, excitement, accurate setting, real sound effect, and the great storyline.

The environment is incredible, it's real. But even its real it offer you lots of fun. You won't be disappointed by this game unless you are really crazy. Modern Warfare erects a new milestone for FPS."

172309,5,"I'll spare you the novel and just say that while I have tried many other MMO's, I found all of them to be bland and boring. This one however captured my attention from the get go, and the more I play and exdperience the MMO aspects of this game the more I love this game.

I am a complete PVP addict!

There is room for improvement no doubt, but even in its current state is extremely fun and addictive game to play. I used to laugh at people ""addicted"" to MMO's and now thanks to this game I am one of them.

The only bad thing I can say about it is that it is so much fun and so addictive I can't stop playing it.

If your on the fence I'd at least give it a try. The game oviously isn't going to be what everyone is looking for, but for me it hands down the most enjoyable and fun gaming experience I've had in at least 7 to 8 years."
199460,5,"I'll admit it, if basketball is on, you probably won't see me watching it. But that makes my enjoyment of this game all the more impressive I think.

I got roped into playing this at a friend's house after dinner and, after discovering how much I loved it, I ordered my own on Amazon. Go figure. If I like it that much and you love the hoops...I think you'll be even more impressed.

NBA Today feature: Creates realism...all the excitement that is actually going on in the NBA (the real NBA) is streamed into the game during commentary, news, and stats. The ""living rosters"" intersect the real NBA with your game. Trades are automatic, you'll see injuries etc with the interactive menus. It works.

Graphics: I consider them excellent for a Wii game and quite realistic. Again, that's for a Wii game...don't expect tv realism, but it's not an expressionless Mii or a ""Speed Racer"" type animation either. You'll even get accurate facial expressions.

You will get to create your own player, much like you would in the Sims game, and guide every career decision he makes. You create him physically and mentally via his decisions. You will get experience and skill points for his successes along the way which build him to become the ultimate player. Wanna live vicariously? You can here. Play your cards right in your player's training and you may wind up packing for the NBA. You could also wind up in a D-league team til you get your act together.

Sound: Sounds like an NBA game. Provides faced paced action even in sound.

Motion Control: Smooth and fluid. I think anything I got tripped up on was user error as, playing in a group, true basketball fans were all out awesome to watch on this game when my friends did it and did it well. For me, there was some learning to do. I experienced no lag.

The online experience was great, although I have only done that a couple of times. This allows you to play the game with a friend or spouse or family member right next to you OR your relative in another town.

1-4 players can play versus and coop or 2-10 versus and coop online with 5 man rosters on each side.

Conclusion: Being able to take your own player from creation to training to NBA and play online means the game can change every day for you which keeps your interest fresh and the streaming realistic commentary not only better ensures this, but adds even more realism to this fast paced and fun basketball game on the Wii.  I can't imagine anyone not finding it fun...especially a basketball fan."
41804,5,on time and in good  work good  and i will like more  to see like that  think you  very much
11990,5,I just love my Supernintendo console. My son gave it to me when Nintendo64 came out. I have enjoyed playing a lot of games on this console for many years now. Great product.
172318,5,"This game has so much potential is almost unveliavbale, it is only a week after release and i can sfely say that Blizzard better prepare for some SERIOUES competition, not even a week and 1 million subscribers already, thats enough said.

This is the WoW killer.

Totally recommend it if you have played WoW, or still play WoW but are tired of the same old content, and the same updates.

This game is so much better than wow in every sense that all I can say is that you have to try it for yourself, but GO GET IT!!!"
330571,5,"Warframe follows the golden path approach of pay-to-win MMORPG's. You ""can"" pay $400 to instantly get every piece of gear, every buff, every prime Frame, every everything, and you'd still be only better-than-average.

PROS:
Gorgeous graphics
Great mission variety
Great and diverse Bosses
Beautiful tutorials
Entertaining and varied characters
No Pay-to-win, mostly Pay-to-look-cool with some Pay-For-An-Edge
User designed content that doesn't suck

CONS:
Steep learning
Some tutorials are absent
Weird market setup
Some levels impossible to solo
Some bizarre leveling mechanics

Graphics and gorgeous. While you can tell they lifted the Infected from Halo, the environs and the characters are beautifully drawn and decently varied on some central themes. Otherwise the levels, even when repetitious, are only really noticeable at the start and end, and are so enormous that really only starts to crop out after 30+hours of play.

This is even better on PS4. Every mechanic is simplified and works great. You have to grind for components to make new gear and warframes, but otherwise you're in a march across the solar system.

The story is actually pretty good, and is gradually revealed in sidebars and codex entries, as well as a steadily growing number of quests and campaigns. The bosses are fun and have a reason to grind up as they provide mats to make new Warframes by the boss.

There are a few humps. Right around Mars and again around Saturn, the difficulty takes a significant jump. Grinding starts in full force at that point, but its varied enough and fleshed out enough that it feels like a 10% grinding as opposed to WOW grinding. You collect materials to make new gear and weaponry, do alerts and syndicates to get access to speciality items and powers and apparel, and begin participating in PVP and major events, so theres so much to do once you hit a grindwall that its a major annoyance but not a derailment of the progression.

PVP also adds a decent flavor. Even a vanilla level 1 guy with little experience can still get a some decent points.

As usual, the only real limit is the paywall. Not for anything significant, but you're limited in the number of slots you have for mechs, weps and drones, meaning that you could get stuck with only 1 suit, and be required to fork out $20 for platinum to get the slot for a second one. Its also irritating that you can pay for stuff with platinum, and they bury the mechanism by which you can get it with in game currency as a blueprint."

374515,5,"This game really impresses me. I didn't expect it to be a hit, but boy did they prove me wrong. The graphics blow your mind. Way better than Ghosts by a mile. I really recommend this game."
287449,5,remember you are going to need the white hinge pieces from the donor gameboy because this doesn't come with them
188215,5,I got this game long time ago for my son. He really like it so I am going to replace the game for him on his birthday.
112416,5,"For all of you people who rated COD4 less than 5 out of 5, your expectations are too high. The only problem you may have is the lack of cooperative campaign, which is REALLY bad if you're a noob trying to beat the campaign on Veteran. The rest of the game is perfect!

Gameplay:
Smooth, smooth, smooth. And so realistic! It is probably the most realistic game of all time (as well as how easy it is to get killed on multiplayer, which could be bad, depending on your skills).

Graphics:
Better than Gears! Give Infinity Ward the respect they deserve for putting so much effort into making some of the best graphics of all time!

Live Multiplayer:
No achievements are based for LIVE, so if you don't have live, you can still get the perfect 1000 gamerscore for the game. Leveling up helps you because you get better weapons and with custom set, you can customize your guns and perks to your unique playing style.

If you just got a 360, this is a great first game! I also recommend Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter which is undeniably, a great game, as well as it is cheap because it is an older 360 game!"
443994,5,I'm still learning how to use it and it's pretty cool

72016,5,"An interesting and inevitable growth from AEII.

I enjoyed the fact that in this new version not only do the armies of different nations have specialized weaponry, but I also liked the fact that the civilizations have different strengths: the Dutch make money quickly because of their banks, the British automatically increase their population with every ""manor"" they build, etc. I also liked the ""deck"" concept which you can manipulate (a little) to improve your settlement. The graphics are splendid, even if the proportions of humans and inanimate objects (like houses and ships) are wildly out of scale. (But they were that way in AEII also. This is a forgivable matter of visual logistics, however.)

There are mild taunts from your enemies before play begins and sometimes during battles to give you a chuckle. The wild card element of Native Americans and Trading Posts are another added dimension that can be tempting diversions or distractions. There is a lot more going on here than in AEII and yet, after just three or four games, things fall into place.

So far, all I have talked about is the Skirmish mode of the game. The Campaign is practically a different game all together. In other words, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had here than one may have expected. And I am hooked!"
69754,5,Good game
87763,5,"This is definitely one of the greatest games i have ever played.  But...the key thing i would like to note is that i played this game entirely with some cousins and friends.  And when i played it myself...i would definitely say that it is lots of fun when playing with others because of the combos you can do together...a.i. is always off.  It has a great range of characters to play with and has a phenomenal lasting plot/story.  I played it several of times with many different characters and never got tired because of the seemingly endless array of possibilities with buying upgrades and abilities of the different characters.  Buy this game if you are a Marvel maniac or if you want a game similar to Xmen legends 1/2, or want to know how the first game was before the second one came out.  I can't wait for the second Ultimate alliance to come out this September, but until then I will remain a true Marvel maniac and replay this game in its entirety."
218038,5,"I bought this for my 11 year old grandson and he loves it! The whole family gets into it also.  Grandma is not into games too much, but he coached me along until I could play also.  He's the champion in the family, but it is fun for everyone."
280360,5,"Works amazingly. The package is covered in Japanese, but the remote is in English. I bought a cheaper knock off and had to return it because the joysticks wouldn't function right. Do yourself a favor and buy this one! It's flawless!"
295163,5,"I was never a huge or hardcore Assassin's Creed fan. I had played most of the games but I was never blown away. When they announced Assassin's Creed III, I was actually very excited about an AC game for the first time and it quickly became my favorite one of the entire series. But then this game came along and completely put AC3 to shame. This game is beautiful, huge and very epic. With next gen graphics from the amazing PlayStation 4, AC4: Black Flag is now the best AC game of the entire series!"
226441,5,"I was concerned when I heard that they were going to redue Tomb Raider. As a fan, I was skepticle. Well I was pleasently surprized to say the least. One of th better games for the tomb raider series. Great graphics,good story and fun to play. I couldn't put it down!"
155096,5,Everyone loves to play this game of Wall-E on the Xbox 360.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants it.
424538,5,"These hold up really well.  I have had 1 pair on XB1 controller for over a year and they still look and feel new.  When I got the elite controller I ordered these, now I have a pair on each of the 6 sticks.  Very comfortable with perfect grip."
307909,5,"I am surprised at how polished and fun this game is. Surprised because some of the same people have developed games such as Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide. They're a pretty good developer from Poland. While those games were fun with zombies and gore, they were very buggy and had a lot if gameplay imbalances. This game is not a sequel but more like a better younger brother of Deae Island games. The game is excellent not only because of better graphics but because of the very fun and bug free gameplay. I almost haven't seen a single glitch or a bug from 30 or so hours of playing.
Killing zombies is very fun and satisfying. There are various ways to kill them creatively that helps the player level up more rapidly or gives some other minor rewards. The acrobatics and parkour aspect , while kind of unbelievable, is very fun. It feels better than Mirror's Edge because it is easier to do various tricks. There are still challenges like enemies in the way it falling when you jump without paying attention.
The developers managed to create a very deceptively challenging combat too. The zombies seem slow and harmless individually but when you get surrounded by them everything changes into a hectic survival combat based on quick responses and resource management. Your weapon can suddenly break, you may run out of medkits, and you might suddenly face runner zombies that occasionally appear.

Finally, you can craft a variety of very fun weapons. It is fun not only because of the weapon use on its own but also because there is an incentive to loot all sorts of boxes, containers, pick locks, and search the dead bodies. That and you will want to find nicer base weapons as well.

The only imperfection in this game is very cheesy and often dumb dialogue when you speak to NPCs or hear your protagonist speak. It's all very cartoony as far as voice acting. It can be irritating."
439334,5,"Great game, could easily lose track of time while playing it. Graphics are great, and the civilizations are varied without being overly complicated."

369825,5,"There is a reason why this game has been nominated for and won so many awards.  My son loves this game ""a million times more"" than GTA, Halo, Call of Duty, and all the other similar games he has played.  I played the beta on X-Box, and I knew it would be THE game for both of us.  The intelligent AI is really amazing with the enemy's ability to flank you, flush you out of your hiding spots with grenades, and provide a unique playing experience every time you replay a mission.  We prefer the PVE to the PVP because it is so much more interesting and you get get to play against giant monsters with extremely high life.  We also really like the cooperative nature of the game, and in particular, the Public Events."
239694,5,This is one of the best and most comprehensive collections of all the metal gear solid games and a must-have for any metal gear solid fan.
447289,5,Fun game
327415,5,All tops with this figure and game.  The game is much more interesting and challenging for my 5 year old son.  He is good with puzzles so he works a solving them fairly quickly.  My 3 year old loves to just play with the figures and swap them!!!

346426,5,Such a great price for a Kinect! work good.
436478,5,Awesome amount of activities to be had. It gets wild 60+ days in.
253219,5,I wasn't expecting so many fun games on this game.  It has quickly turned out to be my favorite of my many slot machine games.  There are a lot of games on here that I have never seen in the casino but I'll look for them next time I go because I really liked them. There is one called Nine Suns that I especially like.
105242,5,"This expansion pack definitely adds to the game. Note that you don't need to buy the Warlords expansion as this includes the stuff that was in Warlords, except for the scenarios.

If you enjoyed Civ4, you will enjoy it more with this expansion. It adds whole new strategies beyond what's in the plain vanilla Civ4.

There are some downsides. I feel this expansion was never really completed. It feels more like a beta than a final product. There are some play balance issues with spies, and with corporations, that were never addressed in the patches. Even the final released patch, 3.13 is full of bugs. After you install it, you need to visit a Civ4 forum site where some guy has posted a fix to the official patch. You need to download and install that unofficial patch to the patch otherwise the game is unplayably buggy. I think it's pretty pathetic that a fan had to fix the game instead of the actual programmers working for Firaxis.

But you still should buy it and enjoy it (after patching it as described above) despite the bad stuff. It's just a shame that it's merely a really good addition to Civ4 instead of what it might have been, the ultimate greatest strategy game ever."
99340,5,"I have never been a really big fan of racing games. But I have to say i was very interested in BP when I first read about it. As more and more reviews came in, I decided to pick up a copy and give it a try. After around 20 hours of play, both online and off, I have to say that this is a GREAT game. Racing is so good in this, and you get sucked in so well, that when you actually stop playing it, you start thinking about it in your sleep.

If I had to say one bad thing about it, it would be the difficulty of actually finding the finish line at times. I can't tell you how often I was way ahead in a race, took a wrong turn, and then lost the race. I would have liked a ""GPS"" like system.

You won't regret getting this game. Really. It is fantastic."
44559,5,I got this for my friend Sam and he hasn't mentioned any trouble with it so I guess it's Kewl.
364122,5,My kids are hooked.  Very good game.  The free automatic update adds adventure mode and a bunch of new stuff!
331511,5,"This is a great keyboard. This is great for gaming with its sleek nice design. You may not be able to tell from the pictures but pressing Alt+ F5 changes the backlight color between blue,pinkish purple, and red."
340087,5,"Unfortunately I have seen many reviews that bash this game based on it's length. First off, I have put over 20 hours in to this game not only to 100% it, but to experiment with my play tactics on 5 re-playable levels. There's only one mission out of the 6 that I can say doesn't have much replay value. The game does a very good job explaining the backstory and making it simple for gamers whom never played the MGS franchise. Yes you can speed run through all missions but why would any player want to do that right away instead of exploring the huge military base that is graphically the most impressive game I've ever seen, especially in the main mission when they add rain weather effects. There are POW's to rescue, weapons to unlock, trials to test your abilities, and tons of ways to approach any situation. For those who say that this is a 20 minute or 2 hour game should be really ashamed of themselves, only because you reviewed the game based on the fact that it wasn't a free download."
8133,5,"okay, a Penny plus $3.99 shipping.  That's the cheap price i see right now on amazon for a used copy of this game....$4 bucks?!!  This is a Fantastic game!!  I know copies are plentiful, but Four Dollars?!?!  Okay, Majora's Mask was a game with a HUGE print.  But that commonly goes for over $20.  Wave Race is a Top Notch A+ Title!!  And it is yet to have a proper sequel.  The gameplay was amazing back then, and this is a N64 game i can still go back to that STILL blows my mind!  The wave mechanics are near perfect.  Especially for an early N64 title, 15 years later it STILL works!  Over ALL the many N64 games I love...I find myself casually coming back to this game for a quick game more than any other on the console.  And this is strange because i really don't play racing games.  What makes this enjoyable to me is the ability to do tricks and show off stunts when you don't have to.  In a 1-on-1 race, tricks don't add to your score.  But it's a TON of fun to speed past your opponent needlessly doing back flips off ramps & handstands through the finish line.  GREAT Game!  I'm fiendin' to play it right now!  Also the music is classic.  This game is an overall A triple zillion plus!!"
261665,5,"Battery pack is always great from Microsoft, easy to charge and it hold the charge for multiple days with constant usage. Great product overall and I recommend this product for anyone looking for a quality battery pack and not those cheap knockoffs."
374975,5,"I didn't think anything could surpass the Gamecube controller but this controller did and it is my all time favorite.  The precision is superb.  The ergonomics are superb.  The stick have short throw so your aim is not wonky like a drunken soldier.  The buttons are just the right distance from everything.  Nintendo always gets the controller right and this one is no exception.  I use it for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and is simply the most comfortable, second nature controller next to the Gamecube controller for Windwaker.

I wish Sony would just go ahead and copy this controller for their PS4."
277398,5,"Dark souls will push you to your breaking at time and kick you in the but till you learn from your mistakes , if you don't learn from your mistake then expect to die .... A LOT

Also most boss require a lot of time to get ready to beat, so if you have time to kill pick this up !"
275525,5,"I have to admit, that even as someone who loves Kirby, I wasn't expecting too much in terms of his anniversary collection (probably because Nintendo didn't do such a good job with Mario's anniversary). The game actually flew under my radar almost entirely, only getting me to finally pre-order it days before its release.

Well.

After popping the game in, I have to say that I'm impressed. One of the things I loved right off the bat, was that ALL the games included in this collection can be played with just the Wii Remote. You don't need a GameCube controller or a Classic Controller (although you can use those controllers if you own them) -- all you need is a Wii Remote :)

The games included are:

Kirby's Adventure
Kirby's Dreamland
Kirby's Dreamland 2
Kirby's Dreamland 3
Kirby Super Star
Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards

Perhaps it's just because I never got to enjoy anything on the aforementioned list except Kirby's Dreamland and Kirby Super Star, or perhaps it's just because these game still hold up today, but regardless I've found the collection to be much harder to put down than Mario All Stars (which I only played a couple times).

The games feature a save state-like system. When you return to your Wii menu directly from the game, you can pick up exactly where you left off the next time you play. The only downside I could see, was that in order to return to the main menu in Kirby's Dream Collection you have to reset the software (there's no menu option to quit the games).

Regardless.

Not only does this collection include 6 awesome Kirby games (more if you consider that Kirby Super Star is like 8 games in 1), but it also includes challenge stages in which you have to master the use of certain copy abilities in order to complete them. The challenge stages are a completely new addition -- along with the museum section of the game (see the history of Kirby along a timeline that includes real life events such as presidential elections and the Olympic games, and view virtual box art and trailers for every Kirby game to date).

Despite the fact that the collection is rather small, it's an awesome chance for anyone who didn't get to enjoy these games during their heydays (and for a fraction of the price, too)."
151763,5,Great game !!

131443,5,This is one of the best produsts for the wii.  We have found that it is best to have 2 wheels because it is great to do competitive family racing such as tournaments.
135339,5,sadly not what i needed but still surves a vital function now.  i originally got it to reduce the lag on my hdtv.. turns out that every hd tv i got was crap as far as lag was conserned but i kept the cable and now i can use it on my big pc monitor in full 1080p hd
125971,5,this product came in on time if not earlier. item was descibed exactly as it was in the description. thanks.
168549,5,"This is the most successful cross between Patchinko and Pinball! It will have you laughing and shouting at the damn bouncing ball...

At every level there is a number of colored pegs that have to be hit in order to clear the level. They are amongst generic pegs that is OK to hit yet will hinder your access to the colored ones you have to clear - and you have only a limited number of shooting balls.
Every time you shoot a ball it gets used - unless you are lucky to fall into an oscillating bucket and gets recycled. There are also special pegs that give you special abilities for a limited time.
I am afraid I am not doing justice to the game - if it sounds complicated it is not. You pick it up in a minute and it is GREAT FUN!

This is a perfect example of what has come to be known as Casual Gaming. It would be a good idea to download the 60-min trial version from a site, such as REFLEXIVE (you can Google it), and decide for yourself whether this is indeed your cup of tea.

Anybody can make a good game that will run only on a super-computer. This is an example of pure programming genius!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
435480,5,Very very good deal ship fast
348487,5,My son has about all these games.  He loves this one.
132075,5,"I was worried when I read reviews that there was no signal or that it was too tight in the back of PS2 slims. I went on youtube and watched a few videos to see for myself and it seems like people who are having problems with their component cable did not make the necessary changes or made incorrect changes to the setting before switching the composite cable to the new component cable.

Using your Composite cable:

Go to system configuration, highlight Display, Do Not Choose RGB choose instead YpbPr. Press X. Turn off your PS2.

Switch the composite cable to your new Component cable: It is a very snug fit so make sure it is all the way in there. Turn your HDTV to the Component input channel and not the old AV one that is used for the composite cable.

Turn your PS2 back on and it should pop up."
326106,5,"Just a normal 3ds with an awesome pokemon on it. The build quality is good and you won't be disappointed. It doent come with the actual game though. Overall, great console for those who love nintendo."
173697,5,"With all the hassle of getting the right gamepad or joystick for your PC, have you ever wished you could just plug in a Playstation 2 controller? Well now you can, and not just one, but FOUR at once. As a USB device, it's easy to plug and play, and you don't have to worry about restarting your computer every time you want to re-arrange the controllers or plug/unplug the device (though it may have to install the USB drivers if it's the first time you've used it).

This is a great tool, not only because the Playstation 2 featured a wide variety of gamer-friendly controllers over the years, but because due to their hold on the gaming market for so long, they are very easy to find and fairly inexpensive.

This particular plug is one of many that are now on the market, but its claim to fame is that it has four ports right on the USB plug (a somewhat large, black, semi-transparent plastic affair). You just plug up to four PS2 compatible controllers in and rock and roll. There is a mini CD-ROM included (don't throw out that cardboard backing from the package!) which has a calibration tool (it's quick and painless, if needed) and it's a snap to use. There is full support for the (overrated) ""Rumble"" feature on the Dual Shock controllers and you can use the digital D-pad as well as both analog sticks, and all 12 buttons (two of the ""buttons"" on the PS2 are just pressing each analog stick as if it were a digital button). I tested this with some sports controllers from EA, an official PS2 controller and one of MAS System's arcade sticks.

In this age when a lot of classic arcade and console games are emulated on the PC, it's nice to be able to use a gamepad or joystick that is closer to the ""real feel"" of the original game.

The only complaint I had was that after installing from the CD, the plug only reported three controllers connected (it always refused to recognize the fourth). I googled the official website and found a set of updated drivers for Windows 2000 (my OS), uninstalled the existing drivers, and installed the new ones. Worked like a charm. Now I can play four players anytime! The included software also lets you reconfigure the buttons and enable turbo if you want to (something I'm not sure all similar plugs, like the two plug adapter I got doesn't have).

While I disagree with the legions of Sony fanboys who say that the ""Dual Shock"" for the PS2 is the greatest controller ever designed for video games, some of the third party variants on it are quite comfortable in your hands. The great thing about this product is that you can choose whichever ones you want. I haven't tested PS1/PSX controllers on it, but supposedly those should work just as well.

According to the advertising blurb, this was designed not only for game pads and joysticks, but also Dance Pads. I haven't tested it with any of those, but I know many high quality PS2 dance mats have been released, and via emulation of the PS game (or the PS2 games which are in a preliminary stage of emulation, and require top notch systems to run average speed) or an officially released DDR type game for the PC you could use that here.

The fact that game controllers do wear out eventually is also a reason to get this plug, since a console controller that has been modified to use USB or something will die and then you're stuck. This way you can just find another cheap controller and plug it in to one of the slots.

Similar products exist out there for other systems (Xbox, Saturn, Dreamcast, N64, Gamecube/Wii), but I'm not sure that any besides this one support four instances of the same system's controller type (some plugs out there will support multiple systems, but one of each, like 1 Xbox, 1 Gamecube, and one 1 PS)."
36306,5,"I love this game. People complain that dungeons repeat and the graphics aren't perfect, but THAT ISN'T WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT!! It's about the excellent and gripping story, which always compels you to keep playing. I've beat this game and am almost done with part 2, which is also great. Buy this game before you play any of the other games in the series. It's not as short as people would have you think, with the side-quests it's about 30 hours. Buy this game immediately if you like RPGS!"
17806,5,Great condition

293124,5,my 6year old son loves this video game and asks why it took me so long to buy it.
13829,5,"While I would have agreed with most negative / melancholy reviews about this game when I originally recieved it, I must say that many years later with nothing to do I picked this game back up and inserted it.  Having beat the game the first time and now on my second playthrough (tragically my save file from the first game is long gone) I'm going to have to say that this is trully a great game.  Though I could agree that a quick menu to changing weapons would have been a nice addition, I spend sooooo much time in the menu just to customize my hero to my specs I never noticed.  This is not the standared RPG that FF7 presents nor is it anything like that of Diablo.  Born from the mistakes of Chocobo's Dungeon, Parasite eve (1&2) and ofcoarse the infamously terrible Eheirgiez Dungeon (I spelled it wrong and I don't care) This game has managed to take what was good from all those games and build off it.  While Customization abounds in this game, if you lack either the intelligence or the patience to play this game then I suggest you go back to a conventional RPG and forget you ever heard about this. While what may seem like nothing but tedious gameplay, try putting this on par of a beginers experience of D&D your first play through. (because I can gaurantee that after your first run, you'll know exactly what to expect on any upcomming situation.)"
276721,5,"The dreamGear Comfort Grip is aptly named. It's very comfortable. It completely eliminated the ache in my hands after a longer play session. 30 minutes of gaming and my hands hurt, not after buying this though. If I had to pick a single gripe, I don't think the top piece really serves any practical purpose except to pull the design together. It could provide protection from dings and scratches, I'm sure but it's just another thing to get dirty. I keep just the bottom piece on. But that's just me. Both pieces though fit good, with only a minor exception. The back of the case doesn't fit like a glove so you do need to push the case up just a bit to get the power cord into place. There is also a little adjusting to get a game card in and out. That shouldn't prevent you from picking up this case though because it's still fantastic and you're still going to love the way it feels in hand. Goodbye fatigue."

49341,5,"Any one who likes starwars will really enjoy this,plus you get to unlock some old school starwars games! the verse and coop modes are cool too!"
130396,5,"I love this game, it has great graphics, storyline, music and tons of action. I have some friends that are still crying because it is not the same kind of game like Resident 1, 2 and 3 but I think is a breath of fresh air. Different doesn't mean bad.

The only little thing I would add, it would be the possibility of shooting while you walk or run. Just like you do it in Dead Space.

A must have for any Resident Evil fan. !!"
248635,5,this is a great racing game. easy to setup and play with friends sharing the same wifi connection. the game did feel a bit short if you are playing solo.
333928,5,"I'm a huge Assassin Creed fan but I never bought this game in the past thinking it might not be what I was looking for.  6 hours into the game and I'm hooked.  This is my first Bioshock game in the series so I have no reference to base my opinions on regarding the series.  For this game alone, I'm amazed at the simplicity of the environment yet the level of detail.  They have ensured that this virtual world gives the feel of another world, and you're part of it, yet it removed all of those unnecessary concerns some games stick players with like managing a massive inventory, trying to complete 50 missions/quests all at the same time, and constantly having the need to get your bearings and check a map.  Easy to immerse yourself in this FPS.  I held off trying this game for some time now, but since I was able to buy it new with 'Prime' and have it delivered, for the same price others charge for a used version, I figured I'd give it a shot.  Part of the concept to the game is figuring stuff out.  You are partially in the dark when it comes to things like where weapons come from and what are these coins for, but that's intentional.  After all, you are thrust into a new world sent on a mission you really don't quite understand.

If you enjoy First Person Shooters, or virtual reality games with a complete environment, then this game is no-brainer."
120949,5,Very good game. I enjoyed it. Just like real life. The graphics are better than call of duty 4 and beyond. The sound is much better and more realistic. get this game!
441448,5,"Shipping is generally satisfied, but too late."
77944,5,"Was in good condition and as advertized,  Rating of E for
everyone, it is best suited to the younger players rather
than Everyone,"
63433,5,"This game is awesome!  I just purchased it today, and I had a hard time getting myself to stop playing.  The graphics are amazing, and the characters are hilarious!  There is a lot of ""adult humor,"" similar to what is found in films such as ""Shrek 2,"" or ""Toy Story.""  It is not too easy, but not too difficult either.  The loading times are extremely fast considering how detailed and sharp the graphics are.  I chanced it and bought this game before I ever played it, and I am very glad I did!  Go and pick up a copy asap!  There are not very many copies available right now through the major video game retailers, so grab it wherever you find it at!"
347230,5,"Works fine, and its long enough to charge and play. Been using it a while now and I haven't had any problems. If I do, I'll edit this review

Edit- I've been using this for several months now and still no problems. I'm very happy with my purchase and would absolutely recommend this anyone. I'm sorry for those who got defected cords that stopped working. But for $10 I think this is a must buy for ps4 owners."
142581,5,"Great game. Huge replay value. Create a Spirit/Nature character and find an item that a Warfare/Defense character would love? There is a transfer vendor who moves items from character to character quickly and easily. Accidentally spend a skill point on something you hate to use? A merchant can untrain it for you for a reasonable fee. Includes nine completely unique skill sets (Nature, Storm, Earth, Defense, Warfare, Rogue, Hunter, Spirit, and Dream). Pick two skill sets to determine your class. Pure genius. This game has everything that Diablo 2 missed. Yes, I said it. Diablo 2 has faults.

Only complaint: Ironforge isn't putting out more patches for Titan Quest. I want more content. This game rocks."
301943,5,"fits the case very snug, and planning on getting some custom wraps on it to personalize."
453721,5,"This is a great game as far as I've gotten to play. They have this available in the PlayStation Store (for all you PS3/PS4 owners) for a low cost, but if you went to get it online or in a gaming shop, it could cost you big bucks. Seems like it's a very rare version of the Castlevania franchise, so if you're lucky enough to get your hands on a copy of it, you won't be disappointed. Awesome, mysterious & kinda creepy, just the way we like it, & worthy of 5 stars... :)"
6102,5,"FF VIII is hated because it is not FF VII. It offers amazing gameplay, huge sidequests, great graphics, a cast of interesting deep intertwined characters and alot of optional material. All the different summons (Guardian Forces) and the abilites they come with alone makes the game thrilling. A must play for any RPG games concerned with plots and side quests. Also you can get Odin as a""summon"". I put it that way because once you get him he will randomly appear and kill every enemy."
310039,5,"This item is a wonderful way to get your exercise.
My daughter love this video she's been using it since we received it."

456619,5,"I have been playing Crash games on my playstation for years, and having recently acquiring a Game Boy Advance SP, I have gotten this game(Ihave previously played Nitro Kart on an X box and loved it) so I figured it won't be bad on a Game Boy.

This game rocks! Mine didn't freeze and I had no problems. The racing is really exciting, but it took me a few practice courses to acutally win- there are diff mondes, but the one i like best is where you race to be 1st. You catch boxes with surprises, you can fire missles, throw ice cubes that freeze others, use clock to slow others, leave tnt crates, and other nasty traps, while you race through different worlds

When I start playing it, I get glued to it, and I don't want to do anything else. I stay up all night and want to leave work early just to play.

Crash and his crazy team are racing, and you just KNOW it will be super. Love this game, im making sure I have the version of all other consoles, so I can play it whenever and anywhere I want."
229337,5,"The case is made of nice hard plastic. Lets you see your games easily. I have to tinker with it some more because I wasn't able to get the styluses in the right slots but not a bid deal. It is easy to put the cartridges in and it's a little harder to get them out but I would rather that, than have them slip out. Delivered fast!"
432158,5,"Great cable for my Playstation 2. You can tell it's actually decent quality TONS of other cables out there (which I've tried for NES, SNES, and Xbox for example). If your game happens to have progressive scan capabilities you're definitely see this cable shine (makes the PS2 graphics pretty darn good - even compared to Xbox 360 and the like...not bad at all!)"
483309,5,Shum'p at its most hectic!
160646,5,"I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said, but this game is wonderful.  It has a great blend of different genres to it, a great story that immerses you deeper into the game, and it's just really well done.  You have to play this game."
420737,5,great gift!
57104,5,Very well made. Should last for years.
348043,5,If your like me and found yourself with the gummies on your PS4 broken and starting to crack look no further. These are the best ones I have found and I have tried a lot of them.  Only one problem is that getting those lil suckers on is time intensive.  What i found best to maximize them was the cut off the old original gummies from the PS4 off (be careful doing this) and put these guys on the now-bare plastic joysticks.  I've used this controller at least 15+ hrs a day sometimes and they still haven't let up.  Great thing is you get 3 pairs so you can give a pair to your friend if he needs em too. Great product.
35121,5,PErfect condition. Has plenty of memory space. Everything I look for in a memorey card. It was deffinatly worth buying. Especially since I recieved it much earlier than I expected.
366230,5,my kids really love this game they take it to their friend's house so they can all played i even played it and it's enjoyable.
26879,5,this is a kicktail combat game even if it ia a tad bloody this is not combat evolved this is gaming evolved
185023,5,I love my Nintendo dsi. It is such a nice upgrade from the previous version.  I love the camera and all of it's functions.  Iy is a great size and not too heavy.  You can play ds games and download other games as well. I think there are functions of the dsi to please anyone. My favorite thing about it is the color options.  Mine is hot pink!
209133,5,"I've been using this case for my DSi XL for years, I just purchased another one for my 3DS XL and it fits perfectly!"

169461,5,"Top Notch! The audio quality for the headset and microphone is outstanding. I can't recommend other device other than this, I use it everynight while playing online on me PS3 and I have never experienced a problem."
42137,5,"I have completed the single-player mode of Midtown Madness 3, unlocked all vehicles and play MM3 online at least 3 hours per day (yes you read that correctly). I am an avid Xbox and PS2 console player as well as an Xbox Live devotee.
Midtown Madness isn't your normal racing game. In fact, the series has become famous for its ""fly by the seat of your pants"" method of getting the job done no matter what the route, damage or life threatening moves you need to accomplish. The single player mode includes careers you can progress through in Paris and Washington DC from delivering pizzas to full on police pursuits. You can also select ""cruise"" mode and speed around the two cities looking for special paintjobs to unlock for each vehicle. But online mode is where this game really shines.
You do not need to unlock any vehicles to use them for online play, but paintjobs can be unlocked to use online and two secret, undocumented super cars are available if you have the patience to get them. In addition, the game offers numerous unique and interesting vehicles that can be downloaded free-of-charge, via Xbox Live. Once online, you can choose a standard checkpoint race, or a number of different variations of ""tag"" where you're it and must tag others, or the other way around. My favorite mode is where one player starts off as a cop in a patrol car, and must collide into other players turning them into cops as well. The winner is the last man standing, who usually finds an entire fleet of patrol cars chasing him/her across the city at breakneck speeds. The best part of this type of challenge is anyone can pick up the controller and understand ""you've just gotta run from the cops."" I've sold this game to friends and family that have tried it once at my house.
Midtown Madness 3 is the most exciting and interesting ""non-serious"" racing game available. The single player mode offers a variety of fun and interesting challenges, while online play ensures that you never have the same challenge twice. This game is a ""must have"" title for anyone who has an Xbox Live gamertag."
313098,5,"As a husband, father and someone who works 60 + hours a week, this game was perfect for me. Not too long, great story, graphics and soundtrack. I have no buyer's remorse at all. Also the fact that other than The Walking Dead, this is probably the easiest Platinum Trophy you can get on the PS4. I hope they make The Order: 1887 either as a whole game or DLC."
304317,5,great quality for little  money
20329,5,This game is a MUST for anyone who still has a genesis. 6 awesome games in one is a can't miss deal.
345933,5,Worked amazing and got here quickly!
31785,5,"This game is the best blend of fantasy, Role-play strategy, and war I've ever played on the PC.  Can you say, 'Addictive as Hell?'  The game's pretense is quite simple really- Four different races, each with their own unique abilities and leaders(heroes) are at war.  You can either play the story mode, in which you control the races in turn and complete set objectives,  or you play custom games, in which you build up your army by mining resources, then go kick the spit out of your opponents.  Each race has 3 heroes(Special units) that you must bring into battle to gain experience points.  The more experience you gain, the stronger you become(duh) - thereby unlocking more abilities to use in battle.  Graphics are quite amazing(If you have the system to handle it) ...  All in all though the game is great! Large battles, great animation, and intricate spell design make this game a must have for any RPS gamer."
373525,5,I think best on  the market
304315,5,"I've been using these headsets ever since they were released back in 2013. So I can attest that they definitely perform as advertised. The construction may seem on the flimsy side, especially where the swivels are, but incredibly the original set lasted until last year when that part actually broke. The sound quality never diminished throughout this time. The bass is well accentuated and punchy, the mids are clear, especially when listening to dialogue-heavy content, and the highs are crisp -not shrill. The 7.1 simulated surround works very well through the included sound card and software. It definitely helps while playing first-person shooter video games. The mic is clear, although sometimes it picks up a bit of ""popping"" because it does not have a cloth or pop-blocker -especially when breathing right into it. This is alleviated by placing the mic in the proper place before playing. The headset is rather light and comfortable. I wear them often for more that 2 hours at a time and they remain comfortable. However, the ear must be placed properly inside the cup so that the material does not rub too much and cause irritation. This doesn't happen too often but it must be mentioned. As far as the cloth in the cups, I appreciate that they are removable and washable. I really like this headset, and I even have gifted several pairs as the price is very attractive. My only gripe, which is also a strength, is the long cord that gets tangled and ""curly"" all too easy. One must pay attention and ""uncurl"" it from time to time so that it does not fringe as it as a fabric coated cord. Other than that I most definitely recommend it. Hope this helps!"
128005,5,"I was never too fond of RPG's when I was younger, no matter how much I loved video games.  Final Fantasy VII changed that, along with how I looked at the genre, as I, like many others, became addicted to the game's emotional storyline and well-rounded characters.  Since then, we have seen a number of tie-ins, spin-offs, and even feature films based on the Final Fantasy VII universe, and now, Crisis Core has finally arrived.  Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is a prequel to the game, where you play as Cloud's old friend and partner Zack, and uncover secrets and revelations that are full of surprises, and lead up to the events of Final Fantasy VII.  First off, the game is is simply gorgeous to look at.  Not just the cut-scenes, which themselves are beautiful and stunning, but even the in-game graphics look great, making this undoubtedly the best looking RPG to hit the PSP, and the game's voice acting is even better.  The game's combat system is also worth mentioning because it isn't quite turn based, and isn't quite real time.  Instead, it is a fast moving system that is quite fun in itself, even if it may come off as a bit too easy for some.  Leveling up and performing Limit Breaks is now determined by the slot machine-esque DMW system, which is a fun little twist as well.  There are familiar characters abound as well: Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, and of course, Sephiroth.  The game's story wonderfully weaves into FFVII mythology, and offers some new perspectives on Zack and Sephiroth, and those respects alone, Crisis Core is worth picking up.  All in all, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is a stunning achievement that is an absolute essential addition to your PSP library, and needless to say, if you love everything Final Fantasy VII and you own a PSP, you have to pick up Crisis Core."
123892,5,It was ever so slightly tricky to plug into my N64 but has worked flawlessly ever since. I found out that the early N64 systems had power supply issues and tried replacing mine to see if it fixed the issue and so far so good. A great low cost way to get your N64 running more stable.
263674,5,Not much to say about this product. Plug into P S P Vita and it was detected and store games.
285200,5,Perfect for my small desk when I couldn't get a Black Widow to fit.
291257,5,very good
14999,5,"I was handed this Golden Box of Legendary-ness for my Birthday. If you haven't played this yet, it's too late. lol You'll never be able to put yourself in the proper context to appreciate how awesome this game is to those of us that played from the beginning. EPIC piece of history right here."
66067,5,"I only played for four hours, and I am very impressed with the game design. The characters in this RPG are so colorful and vivid. I have to say that I have longed to play a real turn based RPG for a long time. Nowadays, most RPGs are real time and not very interesting. I loved the fact this RPG sticks to the old RPG style. You will notice that it is easier to level than in the old dragon warrior series. I think I will recommend this game to all RPG fans."
451076,5,Ok
200705,5,These gloves are the best Wii accessory I've purchased so far. That's saying a lot because I buy every damn thing I can find. Use these gloves with Punchout! and you'll have a blast. I promise.
266374,5,"'++++++ BACKGROUND ++++++
X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a remake of the classic game X-Com: UFO Defense (UFO: Enemy Unknown outside North America) released in 1994 and is considered one of the top ten games of all time for the computer.

There are currently two re-makes currently undergoing development to be published by 2K. The first, known as XCOM, will be produced by Irrational games and depicts the XCOM universe as a First Person Shooter in the 1950's although recent announcements suggest it has been moved to the 1960's and will be squad based combat.

The second, X-Com: Enemy Unknown, was developed by Firaxis games and consists of the game I am currently reviewing. Firaxis are veteran developers of the genre of strategy games due to development of games such as Alpha Centauri and Civilization under the guidance of Sid Meier, one of the companies co-founders and creators of such classic games as Sid Meier's PIRATES!, Civilization, and Railroad Tycoon.

++++++ GAMEPLAY & COMBAT ++++++
X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a return to the world of single player strategy games that are few and far in-between in this world of first person multi-player shooters. Gameplay is divided in-between two areas; management and battle skirmishes.

In management, you build up your bases, upgrade facilities, preform research and development of weapons all the while monitoring your finances which always feel like a heavy burden you are carrying upon your shoulder you just cannot escape.

The skirmishes are where the meat and bones of the game lie and where you may spend a majority of your time. Simple choices you make in a turn-based fashion have an overall effect on the outcome of the battle. If you slip and make a poor choice the computer will make you feel that error. It may seem fun to go around and annihilating everything in your pass by using high explosive weapons but strategy requires you to capture and collect your enemies bodies and weapons. To get close requires strategy, planning, and luck several moves out. A well thought out strategy and turn is the key to success.

You spend your time recruiting, customizing, and developing your soldiers while watching them rise through the ranks after each successful mission becoming attached in the process only to have them fall in combat....and fall they shall. Your memorial wall will be filled by the midpoint of the game from the losses you will sustain. With the close intimacy of you and your men, the loss of a high ranking officer is a devastating moment to be played through and experience first hand.

The gameplay, compared to the original, has been streamlined but that is expected as the fact the game has been customized to fit the multiple of consoles it has been released for as well as the fact the field of gaming has changed a tremendous amount in the eighteen years since the original was released. The console does play rather well compared to its keyboard/mouse counterpart on the PC.

++++++ GRAPHICS & PRESENTATION ++++++
The graphics are, obviously, an improvement over its 1994 counterpart. I have had several issues with camera angels. Also, the action shots that you endure that became popular since Fallout 3 are entertaining if somewhat repetative. The skirmishes provide a very destructive environment that will leave the battlefield resembling swiss cheese that was burnt in a microwave.

++++++ CHALLENGE ++++++
The game is challenging but is not at the point where you feel as if you need to throw the controller at the wall because you have reached an in pass in gameplay.

Some have stated that this game is more difficult than the original. The reason why is the original X-Com in 1994 contained an error so all difficulty levels were the same. Later X-Com games were noted for their increased difficulty because this issue was fixed in sequels and later editions of the game.

++++++ STORY ++++++
The story is, overall, engrossing throughout the game and provides motivation to make it to the finish to see the end result. Who doesn't enjoy a good Human VS the Evil Aliens story?

++++++ CONCLUSION ++++++
This game is worthwhile of the title ""X-Com"" even with the high expectations and standards set before it by the classic ""X-Com"" of 1994. This game has met and exceeded the challenges set before it.

Highly recommended for those that enjoy turned based strategy games as well as those that desire something different than the dozens of first person shooter games that now littler the video game marketplace."

7444,5,"This is one of the greatest video games ever, and there are only a handful of those. It has to be the first video game I ever played, and also the video game I played for the longest time. It kept me entertained for years, no other video game I had lived up to my expectations as this game did (other than Road Rash 2, Super Mario Bros, and Sonic 3 and Knuckles). Like Sonic 2 isn't cool enough already, there's also 2-player. And 2-player mode isn't just a small addition, either-it's just as fun as single player. Sure, there are only four small stages for 2-player, but those four stages pack a real fun punch. The new special stages are also funner than the special stages in Sonic 2's prequel. Although Tails can't exactly use his ability of flight, it's still pretty fun if you play with a friend, because Tails can really help Sonic. He can make the boss fights easier, he can kill badniks before Sonic can devastatingly crash into them, and he can also collect those rings that Sonic doesn't want to get because he doesn't want to destroy his ring total. This game is purely amazing, and I think it's more of a classic than the first in the series, the one and only Sonic the Hedgehog. Out of all of the Sonic characters out there, Tails and Knuckles had to have the most awesome debuts. I actually still play this game from time to time-it just never gets old. Sometimes, I don't even have words to describe how fun it really is."
212734,5,I had mixed feelings about the first Dead Rising.  I really wanted to like it but I absolutely hated the timed story and having to do escort missions.  I felt like I couldn't play the game how I wanted which was to just explore and mess around.  The new Sandbox mode lets you do just that and is easily worth the 19.99 the game is going for now.  On top of that you can create a large amount of crazy weapons from just simple items.  Electric (wheel)chair anyone?
330065,5,Perfect
273656,5,"Sony did several things wrong with the Vita off the bat.  One issue that not many people know about is the fact that it won't charge without the standard charger.  There is actually no reason for this otehr than greed.

Looking at the charger, it is a standard 5v, 1.5 amp charger.  This is just about the same exact spec as a cell phone charger yet the phone charger hooks to the usb cable and is about 1/4 the size.

This adapter tip gives you the ability to charge the Vita off any usb source.  Worked on my usb battery, my tablet charger, and my laptop.  With this, I can now actually fit my Vita in a protable case and not worry about dragging around the full charger.

Not having to buy the extended battery is also a plus as it is also overpriced much like everything else Sony is slinging with this console."
243870,5,"This is an amazing game. The campaign is one of the best ones I've ever played in my life.
The only problem it's the Multiplayer that it's not that exciting as the campaign."

361917,5,amazing and i like the fact it makes you be a team player
186590,5,The legend of Zelda spirit tracks is a lot better than phantom hourglass. I didn't care to much for that hourglass and how you only had a limited time to get to where you were going. so in my book Nintendo did a good job with spirit tracks.
454071,5,"This game is a great game. You can play an exhibition game, season, home run derby, franchise mode, expansion mode, and the new batting practice! In franchise, you can play up to 20 seasons. Some players, get better, some get worse, and some even retire. In the all star game, it isn't the same players every time. The players that have done the best go to the all star game. Same thing in expansion just that you make up a team.
pros:
 1. Real 2002 rosters
 2. Unlock NL Legends, AL Legends, and can play as Cooperstown Legends
3. Draft, change rosters.
cons:
1. Too easy to hit a home run
2. Too many errors
Those are the pros and cons.
If you are a baseball fan, buy this game. Otherwise, you should probably rent this game first."
241289,5,"I agree with the reviewers who commended this wheel for vastly improving their enjoyment of Forza Motorsport 4.  I am a newbie, and had the same experience, with none of the negatives.  I was enjoying Forza 4 with a traditional controller, but wasn't performing well (and rarely made it to the finish line without leaving plenty of paint behind).  Now, it's even more realistic, and quit a bit more satisfying.

Especially while the price here is $40, I'd recommend anyone with Forza 4 (and probably other games, too) would find this a worthy investment!"
400320,5,I've played this game a lot and I can say it's probably the best NBA 2K in years.
271800,5,Works like a charm.  The drivers load quickly and it's ready to go.  I use an USB extender cord and just plug & unplug as needed.
123232,5,"I love this game. I'm not a huge gamer, all of a sudden we decided to get a wii, and I don't like games where I can die, be hunted or need to hide. So driving works nicely for me! I will say it brings out my....angry side. I yell and curse a lot and probably scare the crap out of my neighbors. But its a really fun game to play with my boyfriend or my parents!! Next thing I know my dad just HAD to have mario kart after playing it at our house. He didn't even have a wii system to begin with, so he had to get that as well, but apparently to play mario kart, its worth it. Also, my dad hasn't played a video game since the early 80's, he had no clue. But he picked it up pretty fast and soon had figured out how to play with me online no problem.  We've had a lot of fun playing in the worldwide section with each other, even though we're in different states which is an awesome feature. and I don't even have to let him beat me anymore, he does it with me playing normal. So, honestly, this is a great game for all ages, from the most super casual haven't picked up a video game in decades person, to the one who plays avidly. Yay for mario kart!!"

445335,5,I like Daisy's a lot because her dress goes all the way down and it's nice and solid but I love all my amiibos.
339082,5,"This is a great space-saving product for PS4 owners. Both of my teenage sons have the PS4 and not a lot of space for their entertainment equipment. While my one son insists on keeping his PS4 horizontal, my other one had been looking for a way to stand his vertically so he could put it on the dresser right next to the TV rather than having it take up an entire shelf of his small entertainment stand. This does the job perfectly.

The stand itself looks nice and works well. There are two parts that stick up that go into the groove that goes around the PS4. Just make sure that the PS4's angle matches the angle of the stand when putting it together. Once it's lined up you lock it into place. I was a little worried about how sturdy it would be but once it's put together (which literally takes like a minute) it's very sturdy and holds the PS4 nicely. Definitely recommend for those who need to save some space and want to sit their PS4 vertically."

76382,5,"Of course that is my opinion, however what a fun game.  I know this game is alot like GTA, to many ways to count.  The graphics are really great and gameplay is fun.  This is the type of game that you can play for the next few months and not get tired of it because there is so much to do in the game.  This is what we want as gammers.  I like the fact that once you do a few missions you are not limited to what area of town that you can go, there are no road blocks set up which I think is awesome.  I am unable to write a full review seeing how I am only 11% done with the game.  Buy the game play it and love it.  Not a game for younger kids."
445035,5,Such a wonderful game. A great continuation of an excellent series.
160767,5,"Well, the original MotorStorm was my first PS3 game that l got and being that l liked that game for its online portion, naturally l picked up MotorStorm Pacific Rift. l must say that MS PR's story mode ""Festival"" is a huge improvement from the original MS. There are 4 Zones, Earth, Air, Water, Fire. The tracks are beautiful, challenging and diverse with 16 total. I love the way the developers included Eliminator into the Festival tracks. Now as for Online, l personally feel that the new online setup of Pacific Rift is ""different"". By this l mean, there are no lobbies you can freely join right away, the server decides for you. Having Ranked Races, Casual Races, and Custom Races is somewhat disappointing. Anyway, online races is fun but annoying in terms of wanting to race with your stats going up because everyone is in Custom Races! Go to Ranked Races! The online setup for MotorStorm 1 was WAY better. Overall, if your a MotorStormer like myself you owe it to yourself to pick this up!"

148525,5,"It's strange looking back at ""Gears of War 2"" since it was the game that made me decide ""ok that does it, time to buy an Xbox 360"". Hard to tell why since I had a perfectly good Playstation 3 working and with good exclusives but like most people, the other team has cool stuff too. Playing it endlessly at the time of its release, I find it graphically stunning, fun to play and Horde mode was a bit addicting. But time has a habit of lessening the impact and while I still say Gears of War 2 is an extremely well-executed game, some aspects of it bug the **** out of me.

Story: Taking place several months after the end of the original, citizens have been reported being sick by something called Rustlung disease thanks to the Lightmass bomb detonation. To make matters worse, entire cities have been sinking into the ground and the last city stronghold Jacinto is next and so Marcus Fenix and friend Dom Santiago decide to take the fight to the Locust stronghold and hopefully find Dom's missing wife, Maria.

The problem ultimately with the story is 2 things: one concerns Cliff Bleszinki's claim that the story is more personal. And while there's an actual reason for Dom in this one, too often does it feel like they skimped on the extra elements that would've made the story work. Okay the character Maria, who we have to save and who Dom keeps obsessing about finding, is introduced in one flashback scene and only mainly seen in a photograph. Would've been nice to at least get some extra development on her character considering she's one of the key figures in the story. Secondly is Epic's love for setpieces or namely outdoing their last one. Yes sequels always have a ""bigger, badder, better"" mentality but what made the original work is the bigger gunfights mixed in with more quieter and different chapters. Recall the Kryll section from the first one. Here it feels like you're just constantly shooting ****.

Graphics: Yes Gears of War 2 is definately one of the more superb looking games on the Xbox 360. The lighting, the detail on character's faces, the more improved architecture and changes in fight encounters make this more advanced than the original, which is pretty amazing still. However, as most people have complained, there's an extremely noticeable ""same-y"" feeling to it, what with the greys and browns. Multiplayer doesn't have the same level of detail though that's a given and lag can hit so watch out.

Sound/Music: There's 2 different things to look at in regards to voice acting: the acting and the scripts since its what the actors have to actually say. Some actors can deliver awful lines with gusto and that's a case here since a lot of these lines are just...bad and not a whole lot of character development either but at least the actors do a good job with the lines themselves. The music is big, epic and frequently engaging,making the bigger firefights that much more awesome. Although I am getting tired of the theme that plays during matchmaking though.

Gameplay: Same thing as before since the game isn't like Call of Duty or Halo where you can just run and shoot; this time you have to find cover, pop off some rounds and get back down. It's not as magnetic as it was in the first one where you'd attach to walls you didn't want to and they're quite easy to pick up on. Weapon selection is mapped to D-Pad with default Lancer being right, left being shotgun/bow/sniper rifle etc, up's your grenades, down's your pistols. Aside from the wonky d-pad making you pick a pistol when you wanted the shotgun, it's a lot more faster and immediate than having to scroll through your lists a la Half-Life 2 let's say.

Co-op of course is here but this time there's a special feature: individual difficulties. Say you beat the game and want to beat it on Insane with a buddy (seeing as how the AI is still pathetic). Well rather than tackling insane on both sides, one guy can be on Casual, other's on Insane and just let Casual do all the work up front while Insane snipes from the back. It makes getting that achievement easier but I hate going through single player since the AI on your friends are a little...screwed. One thing: the Friends with Benefits achievement unlocks if the entire game is in co-op, so if for one second somebody logs out, it messes up the achievement and you have to find a friend and pick chapter start. Worse thing is that it actually doesn't tell you WHAT chapters you're missing so it becomes a dart throwing game on a map where you randomly pick an act and hope your missing chapter's in there.

The big draw and the one reason people will repeatedly play Gears of War 2 is the multiplayer. There's quite a few modes from a Capture the Flag variant where the flag is a gun-toting brat who doesn't want to be captured, King of the Hill with hills frequently changing location, Wingman where you and a buddy take on 4 2-player teams and the ever-popular Horde mode. You and 4 others take on 50 waves of locusts that get stronger after every 10. While it's very fun (though slightly boring if you've beaten all 50), would've liked to see variances in the waves since they just repeat the next time and a surprise round would've been nice.

However I will say that after 3 title updates, there's still a lot of kinks to get ironed out and it's strange how the talented guys at Epic still can't seem to get this one right. Weapon damage is inconsistent (guy survives 3 shotgun blasts to the face at point-blank range, he gets one shot 10 feet away and poof!), lag can be frequent, matchmaking can be long and disconnects can result in loss of EXP. Why can't it be like Call of Duty where individual actions bring EXP and not disconnects or Halo where EXP only comes from winning the match. People play to win not find all their hard work vanishing because you had the one bad connection match. So of course naturally most of the achievements are in multiplayer. How lovely.

Gears of War 2 is one of the most successful games of 2008 but it's still not a flawless experience but that doesn't stop people from flocking to it in droves. Give it a play though I find other games have been eating up my time lately."
433620,5,Plays like every other Pokemon game ever. Still enjoyed.
295367,5,"I own this on the 360, hence the lack of verified purchase stamp. Anyway, this was a really fun game in my opinion. It's pretty simplistic in a side scrolling, pixellated fashion. You basically just fight your way through hordes of zombies trying to reach other survivors who are evacuating via helicopter. There are stores along the way to purchase equipment and upgrade your character. That's pretty much the premise...you gotta travel 20 blocks, each one progressively more difficult. All told, it took about an hour and a half to finish, although there is definite replay value, an arcade mode, etc....

I found it to be a somewhat charming, fun indie title. It's only 80 MS points on Live, which amounts to about a buck. For that price, you really cant go wrong."
304007,5,"great controller, great feel, not much different than the 360 remotes, Auto syncs, triggers feel great, all around great product"
333053,5,"Easily one of my favorite games in recent memory.

Just reminiscent enough of A Link to the Past, while bringing a new item system and non-linear exploration.

Excellent game, and an excellent new direction for the Zelda franchise."
10424,5,"Definitely one of the better strategy RPG's I've played, but still difficult.  Not as difficult as the Disgaea strategy RPG series (THANKFULLY), but still pretty hard.  The plot and the ""Job"" system are very deep though and will definitely keep a lot of players busy.  Highly recommended."
267961,5,The fact that I can get my code right after I submit my order is awesome. I just print out the sheet turn on my XBox 360 and enter my new XBox live subscription code that I just paid for a few minutes ago and once again I am playing games online again. I wish all things could be ordered and especially delivered in such a timely manner. I plan to purchase my cards from Amazon in the future because of this awesome service. Keep up the good work.
22532,5,"This is the best Castlevania ever created.  Once again it's the same lets go kill Dracula storyline, but the levels are fun and original.  This game is huge! The castle is devided up into about 12 areas, a few of which are quite small but the other 10 are huge and unique.  The areas go all over the castle from the catacomb to the abyss stairway, from the machine tower to the underground warehouse.  Each area is chunked full of monsters, there are so many monsters, brand new ones appear in each area.  The game is really fun and has pretty high replay value.  It may not be 3D but the graphics are full of detail and animated with no graphic slow down, even with a pack of ectoplasmims chasing you down.  Sometimes when you defeat a monster you'll recieve items and DSS cards which you can combine with other ones to created over 70 different spell effects ranging from flame whips to ice sheilds and summoning golems.  Overall this game rocks. And for reading this review here's a reward. A code: after beating the game in the credits you'll get a code FIREBALL, start a new file under the name FIREBALL and you'll start the game with every DSS card!"

179670,5,"It all comes down to one thing, ITS FUN! a mix between assassins creed, gta, MOH, and a very decent plot based in an interesting occupied France.

Buy it!"
466434,5,I loved it .
179407,5,"This is the 3rd of the Ricochet series that I have purchased from Amazon.  All are similar in the way they play and the types of objects you destroy, powerups to catch and avoid and look of the game.

This one is different in several ways, though.  First, you have a variety of ships to use that you can change when you want.  Second, it has extra levels you can download through a special option that allows 20,000 more levels (according to the game itself -- I haven't counted) and it has a level editor.

All the Ricochet games are fun and as challenging or relaxing as you want by setting the difficulty level.  This has the additional feature of little ""Rico"" doing a flip every time you win a level!

There is one minor problem with the game.  It does NOT remember your windowed/full-screen setting from session to session.  It knows where you are in each level set but not this general setting.  It always starts up in windowed mode.  The window is 800x600 resolution so on my machine is a bit small but it is playable in that mode.  I just got tired of resetting the option every time I started the game.

Like all the Ricochet games I've played (and maybe I'll get the last one someday), it's a 5 star Thumbs-up Keeper!"
55572,5,Love it
51892,5,"First off I want to say that I did not buy another controller for my GameCube yet, but bought the platinum edition system and it came with one controller. My first color pick for the GameCube was this, and that would be followed by Black and then blue, anyway I am here to review the GameCube controller in general.

It is nice and compact, and very comfotable to hold and play. The L and R buttons are a nice place to rest your fingers on when playing, I love everything about the controller. I admit the X Y and the kydney shaped ones are hard to get straight but they aren't like the PS2's and Xboxes with all those shapes! Definetely get a gamecube! The controllers rock!"
485625,5,Good Toys
36046,5,"i picked this up on tuesday when it came out and finished the story mode by friday...and i'm still playing it.
when i first put the game in  i thought ""hmmm...more of the same"" (which was still good), however as i continued to play the game just got better and better. the addition of the map with the zoom feature is great as it made getting to know the city quite a bit easier.the soundtrack has yet to become boring as all the music is listener friendly.
on the downside the game is a little easier than its recent predecessor (GTA3) but the diversity in the missions and the huge amount of side quests and mini-games makes up for the lack of skill needed to beat this.
i fail to see how this game can get boring... as there is so much to do, if i don't want to do a mission i hop in a helicopter and look for packages, if i get bored with that i hop into one of my ""reward cars"" from sunshine auto and go racing the list goes on and on. i even take a joyride sometimes, just to listen to the radio(of course an occasional drive-by just to liven things up is in order)
i won't say this game is more polished than the last because it is not. there are some missions...ie...""the driver"" that are just annoying ,not the mission itself but the fact that if you fail the mission you have to reload entering the club, reload the first cutscene, reload the second cutscene, blah blah blah just to redo the mission.its ironic because everything else in the game has such incredible attention to detail..some examples being ...your character hopping into a convertible..unless the door is open. or the flames coming from the exhaust of your cuban hermes, or the hydraulic shocks of your voodoo.the list is endless...this just shows you that the developers at ROCKSTAR  truly care about there product everything about this game exudes quality. it would have been easy for ROCKSTAR to ""rest on it's laurels"" and re-hash gta3 in a different city.(and i'm sure people would have been pleased),but they continued to raise the bar for themselves and succeeded in outdoing anything to come along previously.which creates a dilemna...where do you go from here? if you create the paragon of videogames and raise the pinnacle so high how do you outdo yourselves nexttime....i guess we'll have to see when grand theft auto 5 comes along....needless to say(but i will anyway)i will probably still be playing this and gta3 when the next game comes out."

330648,5,"I was really surprised with this mouse.  It meets the performance of similar mice that cost at least twice as much.  I had an issue after about a month with mine.  The scroll wheel started randomly scrolling the opposite direction.  After contacting the owners, they gave me several things to try and fix it.  Gave me ideas for narrowing down the problem.  In the end they gave me a replacement.  Very easy to deal with. I am happy to stick with this mouse as well.  it works GREAT for Fortnite building too."
194654,5,I LOVE THIS GAME. its my new addiction. Even bought the expansion!
11073,5,This game is a must have for fans of action and batman!  Buy It!
393180,5,"I like to have my stuff match, and finding low profile aluminums in green has been a battle. Most of the aluminum joysticks in green come with the fatter heads, which there is no real difference. All of my other controllers have low profiles though. I prefer the aluminum joysticks because the rubber on the factory ones inevitably seem to melt off. The metal doesn't wear, the texture on top provides non slip surfaces and they look cool."
414542,5,"Amazing headset. Fit my head comfortably and combined the cables for headphones and microphone into one, unlike my previous headset. The microphone is a bit awkwardly place though."

191168,5,"Pretty cut and dry.....I love my charger on a trip and was looking for a reliable inexpensive one. So far this has been my primary charger for 2+ years and I have never had a problem with it. Works just as well as the OEM Nintendo one, but for a fraction of the price. If you need a replacement, you can't go wrong with this one!"
440811,5,Works great!
23827,5,"It's a sister game, and enhanced version of Gold/Crystal. If you own Gold, or Crystal, you probably won't want to buy this.

Even though I believe Platinum is the best to date, most people believe Crystal to be the best. I would say, wait a bit for Heartgold and Soulsilver, the DS remakes,to come out, but buy these if you want.

It's a very good game for the GBC and it's the first one to have a female option."
117194,5,"I bought this system the other day because I have been putting off buying an Xbox360 for a while now.  This pushed me over the edge to buy it.  This system is free of flaws (red rings of death, overheating) and has an HDMI port to it.  I'm about to get an LCD HDTV so am loving having that option.  Also, this system is so quiet and runs so smoothly.  This is the same system as the normal premium only for the Halo fans.  The color scheme of this system is what made me want to buy it before I knew it was a Halo 3 system.  Buy this system if you're wanting a new XBOX or just love Halo that much."
243779,5,"I never got to play these games back on PSP because, well...I never owned one, but I had heard good things about both.  I was excited when they put them on a Playstation 3 collection, so I could finally play them, because I am a pretty big fan of the God of War franchise.  I have played the Ps2/Ps3 titles and loved them as well! Each of these 2 games is fairly short, maybe around 5 hours each, but combined this collection is totally worthwhile!  If you're a God of War fan or epic action/adventure fan and, like me, have never played these...I highly recommend checking them out!  Ghost of Sparta is the best of the 2, but both games are pretty awesome!  Looking forward to God of War 4 in September of 2012!  XD"
64895,5,"I have this for my PSP and its a great item. The latch takes a little to get used to;but does its job. A few drawbacks though:

Adds a little weight to the PSP.

Cant store games in the case

But good for storing in a backpack or keeping it safe from damage in your house.

21451,5,"I read a few reviews for this game and it seems most of the people are wrong about the game. if you say it has bad graphics than you probably have a crappy computer. and it DOES offer 360 degree view of a highly detailed enviroment. i just recently beat the game and it has a failry interesting ending, not what i expected to happen. the puzzles are fun because they're so freakin' hard! it sounds like most of the reviewers are lazy gamers who don't like challeges and go for the run-in-and-shoot games. the graphics are like an old movie, very realistic for a game. just for the record, the game did NOT freeze or stall at all for the month it took me to beat. a very good game."
397222,5,"Fantastic, Awesome!  Rich detailed graphics, near cinematic cut scenes, 5 different lands to explore and get lost in (it's very important to use the map).  This is the sequel to Lost Lands:  Dark Overlord, in that game the mom rescues her son, in this one the mom rescues herself after being sucked into the Lost Lands.  This sequel is by far, better than the first and there is a lot of game play, it took me several hours over 3 days to complete this game.  My only negative about this is that some of the mini-games were too easy for me and I was playing on the 2nd level, not expert.  I'm going to play this game again in a few months but I will try the expert level next time.  The sorcerer/ wizard/ guide looks and sounds a lot like Gandalf from LOTR.  Recommended

Downloaded easily on a Vista system using Firefox.  It's a large file and it took about 20-25 minutes to download."

Everything is very well packaged and is made with great quality. There is a steel case that contains the intel and info. The statue that comes with the game is absolutely amazing looking. It is actually a lot bigger than I expected it to be. It is a great addition to my gaming room/Halo shrine!"

I really like the aesthetics incorporated into this design, and I really like the wide design with interior contour when it comes to fit.

When you are talking fit, these will adjust to individuals with a larger head as well as individuals with a smaller-sized melon, and they do that without applying pressure. If you are like me, you have probably tried out ones that do that wrong and felt how they press, so it is nice to have a pair doing it correctly. This accents the ear cuffing and gives it a good sound, whereby you can pick up a lot of sounds popping off on a smaller scale like someone trying to snipe you or if you killed someone versus broke a leg.

Something I was pretty impressed with here was the microphone, which picked up a lot better than I had initially anticipated. It also did so without that isolated, in-the-box sound you get from a lot of adjustable microphones, and I was quite happy with that.

309849,5,"My 10 year old son and 39 year old self are having a blast with this game. Neither of us has ever played a ""real"" guitar before. We have played guitar hero, but there is just one strum bar and five buttons for frets on those guitars. For Rocksmith we have a 6 string guitar with 22 frets. That was (and still is) extremely intimidating to us.

First thing I had to do was tune my guitar. Rocksmith walked me through it and checked the tones for me (good thing for a tone deaf guy). The cool thing (for me at least) was that the software knew the problem before I did. If I hit the wrong string, it knew and told me to check which string I hit.

So I went through about 5 tutorials and tried to 100% them. The tutorials are excellent. It starts easy...if you can't get it, then it slows it down to get you used to moving across the frets and strings in time. For a noob like me, this was great. The game amazed me when it told me exactly what I was doing wrong in the tutorials (ie: wrong string, wrong fret...it knew). After you get through the first test, it does the same riff with more notes and complexities. It allowed me to practice and have a sense of success before it upped the level.

You can choose to play lead guitar, rhythm, or bass. You can use your electric guitar for bass, but I have not tried yet. I have only tried lead guitar so far but plan on trying the others.

There are 20 or so more lessons to do, but I was interested in trying a song (knowing I would fail). Low and behold, they actually up the level of play on each song as you improve. So the first time through the easier songs was not impossible even for me to achieve some success. I felt like ""I can actually do this with some practice"".

The part I recently tried was the guitarcade which is awesome. Retro style arcade games that work on your guitar technique. The first game is similar to jet pack joyride, but based solely on how loud you strum the strings and control the volume. The next game is like the old Root Beer Tapper game but you have to hit the right string to ""shoot"" down the right area. I had trouble with volume and finding strings and these were fantastic ways to practice. It includes high scores, mini achievements, and online rankings. I also tried the slide arcade and a duck shooting game that helps practice slides, frets and strings. There are many more arcade games that I have not tried because I don't know the concept (ie: bending) yet. Some games are more fun than others, but the fun and rewarding way to practice is top notch.

The main thing this does not do is teach you to play guitar by reading sheet music. That was not important to me, but worth noting.

We try and limit video game play for our kids, but this game is so educational that we bend the rules and let our kids play Rocksmith at times when they normally are not allowed to play games.

I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to learn to play a real guitar for fun. It provides learning, fun, and a sense of accomplishment. It will provide our family many hours of fun time together."

Please note that the usage of this CD might lead to corrupt your memory cards. Back up your saves games in other memory cards before using it.

One notice is that do NOT take so many cheat codes from the AR Max as it might lead the game freezes; just use between 2 to 3 codes from the AR Max for each game.

If you get confused how to use it, browse from youtube & search the video how to use it. I did that before I bought this. So glad I did my research before purchasing it."

462503,5,"""SERIOUS SAM 2 - XBOX""
Well, first let me say that I am a FPS(first person shooter) nut. However, I consider myself to be very picky. I don't like slow-down and I like good/realistic graphics. After playing a demo of Serious Sam(1) a couple of years ago I didn't give Serious Sam a second thought after about 5 minutes of play. Well, I played the demo for Serious Sam II and was pleasantly suprised(I'm so glad there was a demo, I'd have never tried it if there wasn't). So I bought this at my leasure and after playing it for about 20 minutes or so I realized I was hooked.

This game has the most action I've ever seen in a video game. It's not realistic at all, but that's one of it's charms. It's nothing short of a run-and-gun good time of a video game. To me it feels like what a video game should be like. Fast, fun and tons of action. Literally, it is almost non-stop action. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it's not overly dramatic with lots of corny one-liners and deliberate cliche characters and levels. This game is exactly what a video game should be like. Don't get me wrong, I still love the truly serious FPS, but this is a refreshing break from all the drama and it's a lot of fun too.

FUN, FUN, FUN is the best way to describe Serious Sam II. Nice graphics and tons of action. I'll play this over and over again because it's so addictive and it's a refreshing alternative to the truly serious FPS video games."
302334,5,"Great product, great price. Had one in my 360, got one for my nephew for christmas, since he only had the 4gb 360."
38078,5,"I can't think of a PC game in recent history that was more anticipated then the sequel to Valve's blockbuster, Half-Life.  Early reports indicated that this game would indeed change many aspects of the gaming community such as physics and character models.  When it was released in November my excitment was only matched by my disbelief that it had actually come out, mostly due to the fact the game had been delayed on again off again for nearly 5 years.  So, was it worth the wait, worth the tedious Steam installation and frustration? Yes.

Let's start with the storyline, which is second to none, and due to my hatred of spoilers I'm only going to give you the basics.  You return from your odd state of limbo to find yourself (Gordan Freeman) in a scary, totaltarian controlled city known as City 17 run by a group called the Combine.  What ensues is your involvement in a resistance movement, which will take you everywhere from the city streets to desert wastelands.  The characters you meet are simply incredible, each one has their own deep personality with voice acting that could just as well be featured in a motion picture.  You'll feel a certain attachment to protect those who fight with you, and a loathing for your enemy who are as vile as they are mysterious.

Enemy AI is a little bit dissapointing from what was promised to us by Valve.  While they aren't stupid by a longshot, AI from other recently released PC games can match and even surpass it.  For instance, taking something like a small soup can and holding it in front of your face to use as ""cover"" will cause nearly all enemies in the area to cease fire and attempt to flank.  Even more ridiculous are their predictable combat methods which are as follows: take cover, throw a grenade, charge in, repeat.  By the end of the game I could have taken combine forces on with my eyes closed and speakers on full blast.  However, they will still challenge you, kill you and frustrate you, don't count them out, just don't expect true artifical intelligence.

A majority of the game you are on foot, however 2 levels allow you to pilot both a hovercraft like boat and an off road dune buggy, adding an incredible element of fun and variation.  Your arsenal will allow you to call on everything from standard pistols to the jaw dropping gravity gun, which allows you to pick up and throw objects such as chairs, cans, metal shelves and more as if they were mere pieces of paper.

The games graphics are gorgeous, beautiful, jaw dropping, the list goes on and on.  Without a doubt they are the best graphics so far for any game ever released, to say they have set a new standard would be an understatement.  Characters express emotions through facial features, enemy vehicles are detailed down to the last decal, even the infamous G-man's pores can be made out in the opening scene of the game.

The multiplayer scene is why many people bought the original Half-Life in the first place, and this trend is continued with the second one.  Half Life 2 Deathmatch, a recently released (free) add on by Valve, allows to to participate in standard free for all or team based battles on most of the games maps, fun but not in depth.  For those of you who want to experience everything this game has to offer, look to the now corporate backed mod community which has spawned games such as Counter-Strike and Day Of Defeat.  Using the Half-Life 2 engine these mods allow a whole new immersion in these already great games, CS Source is available for free with the purchase while DoD Source will be released at a later date requiring a purchase for those who only bought the base edition.

Does it live up to it's predecessor? Yes and then some, in fact it makes it's predecessor look like a joke in comparison.  It has all the elements of a great game, and a few minor bugs and issues aside, it is near perfection.  Don't miss out on this game, I say that often, but trust me...do not miss out on Half-Life 2, you'll regret it."
143549,5,"Borderlands is an FPS game with role playing elements, I real enjoyed this game with my XBL bros(also thanks to amazon shipped this game early I got it on Oct 20th like a release day shipping), here I will list a few pros and cons after I got lv25 yesterday for a 12hr straight super phun time.

Pros:
-A horde loads of guns with different aspects, if you love BR in Halo, you gotta love this game, there are tons of 3 bullet burst combat rifle working nearly the same mechanics as BR.
-Loot system similar to World of Warcraft, actually even the colors of the weapon qualities resemble WoW, green is good, blue is better, purple stands for epic, gold equals super rare.
-Nice interface contains everything, menu is great, quest tracking system is good, works like the multi-quest tracking in WoW
-4 player co-op is fun and challenging
-Solo is also very fun(I soloed from lv1 to lv20)
-a variety of control scheme to choose from, default CoD/Halo hybrid style, battlefield style, pure Halo style, southpaw, etc
-Many many other pros, just go play it

Cons:
-Controls of picking up items could be better
-No trading system, it is like back to Dreamcast age where I played Phantasy Star Online, I have to drop an item on the floor to trade it
-the Skill system seems not very balanced(my character is soldier, whose skills are balanced and really handy in tough battles, but I heard on xbox live that Siren is seriously gimped)
-you will be obsessed by the feeling of WOOT and spend tons of time in it(or maybe this is a Pro?)

Summary: Stop reading my blahblahblah and buy this game already!"
365252,5,love it
118130,5,"I, with most wii owners, was very anxious for this to come out and I was lucky enough to get one at my local Best Buy as soon as the store opened on May 21st. They had a few stacks available which I know for a fact were sold out yesterday as a friend tried to get one first thing this morning. I consider myself very lucky as I missed out on pre-ordering which was closed out at most stores weeks ago.

This game, or exercise tool (its really the best of both) is worth every penny!!!!! There is no excuse not to work out since it is so much fun!! I did every workout to start with as soon as I set up my profile and balance board (very easy process) and I am sore today! I also played We Ski for quite some time after I worked out as it is compatible with the balance board. I could feel my calves and legs working while I was playing but never realized how many other muscles were also working. My rear end is killing me so hopefully it will tighten up! I am not really overweight and according to the game I am within the normal range for my height and age but of course I would still like to lose the last 5-10 pounds and tighten up to put me at the bottom end of my normal range. with this game it will happen. The ""personal trainer"" was great (although could be a little more realistic) as you can choose to view him or her from the front or behind and the system created profile automatically tracks your weight, BMI and progress. My absolute favorite is the running game. As you follow another Mii (who acts as your pace runner) the other mii's you have stored in your system are jogging all around wii island as well. They may pass you as you are running or jog past you coming from the other direction. I even created a few more mii's of friends and family since I enjoyed seeing them as I ran.

The only complaint that I have is that the balance board could be a little bigger to accomodate bigger feet. I wear a womens size 10 or 11 shoe and my foot is a little bigger than the alloted space on the board. It did not affect my fun at all but I imagine it could be quite annoying for men with a bigger feet. Also I would recommend the silicone cover for the board as well as the rechargeable battery pack. I don't know how quickly the batteries wear out but It would be really disappointing to get ready for your workout and not have fresh batteries for your board.

All in all...this is a must have for the Wii!!!!!!!"

398396,5,"My list of PROs and CONs and why I gave this game 5 stars.

PROs:
- Goods graphics, and great cutscenes.
- The world is absolutely beautiful, and it doesn't feel as if they just copied and pasted textures.  I felt that Dragon Age did that, and the world felt dead to me in comparison.
- There's always something do.  Discover new locations, destroy monster nests, complete quests, liberate towns and watch its people return, find guarded/hidden treasure, play cards for money or fun, fist fight for money, find more powerful schematics for your weapons and armor, spend the night at a brothel, or hop on your horse and ride off to go pick flowers...I'm sure I'm leaving out more activities since I'm only level 8, but you will get side tracked in the game as you play it.

- There are many enemies to fight, and each has its own set of strengths and weaknesses.  The fight will depend entirely on that knowledge, your level, gear, your character's abilities, and your abilities as a gamer; I have died plenty of times.  The amount of detail they put into their bestiary is refreshing and makes every fight different.

CONS
- There are visual bugs, like people floating or walking through walls and structures, but when you have a game this big, bugs like that are bound to happen.
- The controls definitely take some getting used to.  Running around and the combat feels somewhat clunky.  I feel they were trying their best to not copy Assassin's Creed style of combat.  While AC combat is fun, I feel that combat style is meant to hold the player's hand by having auto-locking on targets, and the AI will wait it's turn before attacking, because God forbid if they hit you...your feelings might get hurt.  In Witcher 3 there is no locking on to targets.  You have to manually move out of the way, there is no tumbling over the backs of enemies.  You have to time your attacks perfectly and learn your enemy's counters/abilities.  You also have to look around on your own, there is no smart cam moving for you.  When fighting multiple enemies it's easy to lose sight of what you were attacking.

Despite the cons I decided to give it a full 5 stars because I felt this game was worth every dollar I spent on it, and I'm sure I'll get my $60 bucks worth out of it.  I feel the developers are the underdogs in the gaming community and you can tell they put their hearts into this game, and I always support the underdogs, especially when their top dog competitors like EA, and Ubi s*** the bed on video games. There's room for improvement, but remember it's 2015.  Games can now be patched and fixed.

Also this game is very adult themed, and I wouldn't recommend getting it for a child.

This is my update:
I was wrong about not being able to lock on to targets; it's a feature I missed during the tutorial, but fighting without it has become my preference.  They also have improved the combat, and your player's movement through the latest patch.

I have beat the game, and enjoyed the story immensely.  I've started over to experience another outcome, and am still thoroughly entertained.

I'm not understanding the people that are griping about the cutscenes.  I understand that sometime you just want to play and not be stuck in a cutscene, but Witcher 3 is one of the few games that I've come across that lets you skip them; so in my mind it's a silly complaint to have."
336573,5,"I first tried these with my PlayStation 4 controllers. I absolutely love them and I've reviewed that version as well. I've tried Thumb Gripz, Grip-iT, Fosmon and I own 2 pairs of Kontrol Freeks, one for each console.  These are still my everyday grips. They have the best texture and grip. The Grip-iT's and Fosmon feel slippery compared to GelTabz. For everyday use I absolutely recommend these. If it's your first time trying grips on your controller, start with these. They will set the bar."

41393,5,"this game is quite a find. it has a unique story great interaction between characters (esp jen and scree)the story is a strange one.
this game reminds me of tomb raider's look and style blended with that of shadow man.
jen tate (voiced by xena actress Hudson Leick) is attacked leaving a club with her boyfriend lewis and after being taken to the hospital
jen awakens (as a spirit seperated from her body) to meet a  gargoyle named scree who asks her to help him in the realm of oblivion.
he leads jen there (in an out of body experience) and our story begins.
jen and scree travel together through 4 realms during the game and jen will gain a demon form to transform into in each, granting her special powers.
i didn't have much trouble with the combat (though a little tiring a times) so im not sure what other people that played the game ran into.
as far as combat goes the only issues was some times enemies (mostly in aetha realm) would lay on the ground not letting me kill them until they regenerated there health fully. sometimes the finishers wouldnt trigger and the enemies would regain health prolonging some fights. otherwise combat was fine mostly the problems i had were controller issues (thats another story)
but its a great game (though a few odd glitches here and there) something unique though is that you can pick a chapter (as you unlock cutscenes) much like a dvd you can restart the game from a certain point by watching the scene from the chapter then the game picks up from there.it was handy as early on i saved the game during a weird glitch that wouldnt go away. but i watched the most recent movie and i was able to pick up near where i left off with out redoing the entire game, overall its worth getting. esp if you like games like devil may cry (though i feel odd comparing it to that series) or shadow man or just games with a dark feel to them."

161631,5,"if you have already played MX Unleashed or any other game like it & enjoyed it, then this is a definnite add to your PS3 collection. i bought it & popped it in and was racing for hours without even knowing it. the game is realitively easy to play & get used to. it's all about the quads, thats the focus, build a bike from the ground up & modify it more & more till it's pimp as can be. World Tour is the career mode on this game with 10 different tour classes each having at least 4 events a piece. thats over 40 races in all. races are from sprints to races & freestyle competition. how well you do depicts how fast you can move on in the tours & gain new items to put on your bike. you can also have up to like 5 different bikes at once. this allows for track & style specific bikes instead of having to change out parts for the different types of events. it's only 1 player at a time though i guess unless you play online..."

It made a HUGE difference; the pads on the FPS Freek grip on tightly and don't lose their grip due to any form of moisture, they set your thumbsticks at a near-perfect elevation and overall enhanced the feel of my controller.
This product didn't magically transform me into an overnight gaming titan, but it has certainly helped alleviate a lot of the issues I had with the original design of my controller and at a fairly affordable price."

45124,5,"XIII is an excellent fps. It has a crappy ending and horrible save games but still is one of the best releases of 2003. The President has been assasinated, You are found on the beach by a life gaurd with a bullet wound and the number XIII tattooed on you. You have lost your memory. Powered by the Unreal 2 engine the graphics and sound are fantastic. It has comic book style graphics complete with ""BAM"", ""AAAGH"" ect. The voice of XIII by David Duchovney does not fit the charecter. I have Win98Se, PIV 2.4Ghz, 512mb Ram, Geforce Fx and it runs great. The level design is excellent and i liked the selection of weapons, you can use objects like bottles, chairs, mops ect to knock out people. The biggest problem is the horrible save game system. It does allow you to quicksave anywhere but when it loads it will be at the start of the level or at checkpoints. This may not be a big problem if the developers knew where to have points but they do not. There should have been checkpoints after boss levels but there is not always one. They are a big problem in stealth levels."
484340,5,awesome set
187111,5,"I will get straight to it... I have never felt a game like that before. I am an old Wii owner, and own plenty of titles, but this one sure beats the others. I have been playing for two weeks now, and like many others before me said ""it will take time"", and like many others before me said also ""once you get use to it, then you won't be able to let go"". I have to admit at first the Wii MotionPlus just wasn't responding to what I wanted it to do; it was like trying to study my moves, and I was trying to understand it's response. I started the game on the easy mode for the grand slams, I lost the first couple of games, but then I got the hang of it, and I never looked back. I won all the grand slams. Some players are harder than others, and believe me when I tell you that you have to study the player infront of you, and see where his/her weak points and attack them. I swiched to the next level now, and I lost 5 games, and got knocked out of the first round at the Australian open, but I won at Wimbeldon. This is not going an easy game to finish, and this is what I like about it. Bare in mind, that when you get an ability from a player and use it, or when you change your shoes or racket and use them; the feel for the game changes. I had to change my approch to the game everytime I changed something. I love it. If you can work your way through your frustrations (which you will have many off), then the game is rewarding."
402972,5,great
252057,5,"Ever since I watched Battle 360 on the History Channel, I have longed for someone to make a video game that would allow me to swoop down on a Japanese aircraft carrier in my Dauntless and drop a bomb right on its deck. About one day after getting Birds of Steel in the mail, that's exactly what I was doing, so thanks Konami.
The downside is that I got this game on a Friday, and by Sunday night I had finished it, with about 10 hours of play. I still feel it was worth the money, however.
It's difficulty levels are simplified, realistic and simulator. I started in realistic, but after a couple of hours of getting shot down, crashing, and having my plane spin out uncontrollably, I started over in simplified. It's still fairly challenging, and very challenging at times, but more doable, so unless you think you are a real hot shot, I suggest starting with simplified.
Now I am going back through it in the realistic level, and find it easier. Not sure I could ever do simulator, since that doesn't even let you see your altitude or your engine speed.
This game is made about as realistic as I suppose a video flight game can be. Obviously real pilots wouldn't have large yellow circles in the sky to show them where they are supposed to go, or red arrows pointing to enemy planes and ships, but I don't see how you would otherwise ever be able to tell enemy planes from friendly when they are diving all around you like a bee swarm.
But the best thing I like about it is that it's an excellent interactive history lesson. I wish more combat video games would be like this. Unfortunately, the majority these days seem to be geared primarily for teenagers, who apparently prefer to listen to a lot cornball dialogue from cliche characters, and aren't usually even based on actual battles.
One tip: At times it can be confusing what you are supposed to do. I realize now this is really what led to my difficulties in the first try on realistic. Starting at Wake Island, you will go out and there will be many enemy ships, and all these red arrows are pointing to them. However there are two specific ships you are supposed to hit so those are the only ones to worry about. You can identify them by hitting the O button for the radar, and the targets you are supposed to hit will be in bright red. Go for those.
Overall, this is a very good game and I am going to take a look at more Konami titles."

5599,5,"This was my first video game that I ever played as kid even before Mario lol.  This game was something out of the movies for me, and it set a high standar for all video games for ps1 for me.  I can only count the fingers on my hand of how many games that can give this game a run for best game on the ps1.

Pros
1.  Everything on this game is a top notch.  The graphics of it's time were superb.  The story telling was excellent.  The enemies were plentiful, and the combat was awesome.  There was plenty of boss fights that I loved, if you read my other reviews you would know that.  Multiple of goodies were added on after you beat the game, so I don't know where you can go wrong with this game.

Cons
1. This game is perfect. Period.

This game was the reason why I play video games because I trying to find gems out there like this one, but it's hard to find a diamond among coal sometimes I guess."

84655,5,"This game was everything I was hoping for and more. There is both the classic version of all 1 on 1 battles through the game, and there is also a relatively long adventure mode where you actually fight your way through different stages and bosses. You can even upgrade your characters through the adventure mode with the new stickers feature. There are plenty of new stages, plus some old ones. Lots of new characters that are fun to play as. Enjoyable extras mini games such as boss battles and event matches. Great Game all around."

207338,5,"Basically the controller allows me to use my computer from a distance, disregarding programmatic difficulty with allowing UAC prompts.  It does of course require my software, however.

For games it's basically what you would expect, an xbox 360 controller.  A quick tip, every game that says ""Games for Windows"" supports this controller."
453522,5,"DOOM Collector's Bundle(2002). A compilation containing Doom 1, its expansion ""Thy Flesh Consumed"", Doom 2, and two of the three Final Doom scenarios: ""TNT"" and ""Plutonia"".

This is it. THE granddaddy of all FPS games. THE second (don't forget about Wolfenstein!!). The game which started an online multiplayer revolution. The game which introduced us to 3-dimensional virtual environments. The game that has spawned countless clones. The game that supposedly influences people to violently attack each other in real life (riiiight...). The game that manages to successfully combine Mars, Hell, and chainsaws in a way that makes sense to the objective of the game. Onto the review...

I've been playing DOOM for 10 years like a lot of us here have, though I was introduced to it in a bit of a different context than most. Back in 1994, I started off with the crappy Sega 32X version (yeah, go ahead and laugh. It only had 17 levels, and NO CYBERDEMON!!). I also tried several other console versions (keep in mind back then I had NO access to a PC at all!). I fell in love with DOOM, but felt that the versions I had were waaay too short, so you can understand my sheer disappointment upon purchasing the official strategy guide (designed for the PC version), just to figure out that the version I had was poorly put together and missing a lot of levels/monsters. Then in '96 upon the launch of the Playstation, I bought DOOM and Final DOOM, which proved to be the best console versions out there, featuring a lot more of the PC levels and a creepy soundtrack. I was set for a while.

But over the years I kept hearing people say that the PC versions were the best ones, so out on a whim a few months ago I found this collection for 10 bucks and figured, ""Why not?"". And now I know what everyone was talking about. Wow. This is perhaps one of the best game purchases I've ever made. Simply put, these games were meant to be played on a PC (seeing as it was where they started from in the first place). The fast pace, the surprisingly excellent keyboard interface, and all the other stuff that I was missing out on... all here.

But enough about that. Onto the games themselves. So what's Doom about? Well, you're a marine stationed on a martian moon base who managed to get caught up in the middle of a hellish invasion of demons spawning out of ""gateways"". These demons killed everyone already and are still up to no good, so it's up to you to destroy every last one of them just to be on the safe side. That's the premise. No lengthy cut-scenes, hour-long tutorials, plot twists, shops, experience building, friendly characters or anything else that's useless when it comes down to simply taking everything out.

Most new-generation gamers might glance at Doom and slag off the game for its ""archaic graphics"" or ""mindless key collecting simplicity"". Sure, the game may not seem like much on paper, but DOOM's true bright spot often escapes them. It's something that not even the new DOOM 3 successfully touched upon. What I'm talking about is the ingenius design of it all fit into one incredible package of solid gaming. EVERYTHING is designed to be memorable! The monster variety, the different weapon strategy interplays, the mind-bending scope of the labyrinthine level designs which vary enough to always keep things interesting... hell, even the sound effect of a door opening is easily distinguishable and you can tell it came from DOOM.

Besides that, the best things about the games are the dark hallways with scares lurking around every corner, large open environments that let you strafe around and take out legions of monsters, the berserk pack, folding 10 zombies with the double barrel shotgun, and the Barons of Hell. Those guys are tough. Same with the Arch Viles. I was going to take off a star for the exclusion of the ""Master Levels"" Final Doom scenario, but it more than makes up for the fact that YOU CAN DOWNLOAD COUNTLESS #s OF EXTRA LEVELS ONLINE! All this even after finishing the 120+ levels between the 3 games for just 10 bucks... sign me up!

So what has DOOM taught us? Let's quickly run through the games:

DOOM 1

-The martian moons apparently have vast mountain ranges and breathable atmospheres, despite their size.

-War-hardened undead zombie soldiers always make cuddly teddy bear sounds when you kill them.

-Cacodemons are really just hugely inflated horned crunchberries. (My chaingun says, ""GET BACK IN THE CEREAL BOWL!!"")

-The Cyberdemon's presence is ALWAYS overwhelming.

-The master guardian of Hell (a.k.a. Spider Mastermind) is apparently Krang from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon, only he's sitting on top of a mechanized quadra-ped machine gun mounted vehicle, and he's really ticked off at you.

-Hell's ultimate plans for Earth are to dismember a poor field rabbit. (just watch the ending)

DOOM II

-Nasty room full of imps = Hell. Double barrel shotgun blast to the face = Heaven.

-Fire hurts. A lot. Especially if it's coming from an Arch Vile.

-The Manacubus needs to cover up. Seriously.

-The Revanent's rocket launcher is the best gun in the game that you'll never have.

-If the Cacodemons are crunchberry look-a-likes, then Pain Elementals are the equivelent of Reece's puffs cereal.

FINAL DOOM

-...Is really not ""final"" at all. Good, because I've been playing this nonstop for 4 months now, and I don't want it to end!

So there you have it. One of the best gaming deals that money can buy. There's 5 difficulty settings, so it'll certainly keep you hooked, though the only true way to play DOOM is on Ultra-violence or Nightmare. This will be enjoyed for generations to come. Recommended to all who have even the slightest curiosity about DOOM."

326154,5,"I owned a Nintendo Wii years ago and decided to buy the new Wii U just to see how they have improved. The experience of playing games on this system is great! Everything functions and runs smoothly, and this bundle is perfect. The Zelda game is fun and will provide tons of gameplay so you won't have to buy another game right away if you don't want to. The included booklet download is not a walkthrough or game guide, but more of an art book. Overall the price is perfect and it's a fun system well worth having."

I haven't played it yet or I could give better comparisons to previous installments.  She said out of all the Rune Factory she's played she's enjoyed this title the most.  I will update the review after I've played.  :)

34035,5,"The graphic for this game really makes you wonder why GTA is still in the market even with PS1 generation graphic. This game is fun to play and has good story line that keeps you captivated. The only drawback is that the game is not long enough. You can finish it in 10-13 hours first time around. But fret not, you'll have four scenarios on where the story can go depending on what you do in the game. All in all, I can't wait for Onimusha 3. I wonder which actress they are going to use."

198533,5,"Alright, Halo fanboys and perpetual whiners: this is it.  The last rodeo for the creators of the most influential and successful video game franchise of the last decade.  And there's only one question on everybody's mind: does Bungie's final Halo game live up to the hype?  Depends.  If you're looking for something to reinvent the wheel and wow you like the first one did, look elsewhere.  But if you want Halo+, here it is. I've rocked every single Halo game through multiple campaigns on various difficulty levels and logged in countless hours and sleepless nights slaughtering my fellow gamers by the thousands, and I have to say this will do nicely.  In this review I'm going to focus on what differentiates Reach from previous iterations of the franchise.

While the campaign of Halo: Reach lacks the ""OMG"" factor of the original, the extremely sophisticated split narrative of the first sequel, the bombast of the trilogy closer, and even the brilliant moodiness of ODST, this prequel is still a solid story filled with all the run-and-gun action and overwhelming odds that have made Halo the signature franchise of this gaming generation. The story of 6 Spartans (Noble Team) encountering the alien Covenant prior to a full-scale invasion of the planet Reach, hopelessly defending the world they call home, discovering mankind's salvation, and their eventual sacrifice make for a fantastic narrative with tons of excuses for action.  I very much miss the massive three-way battles and dynamic set-pieces that made the first two games so memorable and the score seems much more understated and less epic than what I'm used to, but nonetheless no argument could be made that the singleplayer is junk.  Besides, it's just the appetizer.

So the campaign seems to be missing that special something to distinguish itself from it's predecessors, everybody knows the multiplayer is what keeps Halo in your console for years on end.  And the legendary ultra-competitive online combat the franchise is known for has never been better.  Never.  Not even close.  So yeah, guys.  If there is one must-own game in the series, this is it. First off, the matchmaking is fast as lightning. This means less time listening to 12 year-olds shout obscenities and sing awful songs in the pre-game lobby and more time killing and mocking them as you squat on their corpse. Adding a credit-based system that rewards individual achievement on the battlefield rather than ranking you based entirely on whether your team won or lost was a great move.  After all, why should you suffer just because you get stuck with quitters and noobs while you yourself are dropping fools left and right?  The earned credits act both as experience points to advance your rank and can be spent buying stuff and customizing your Spartan.  This rules.  What they are asking for some of the niftier effects is rather outrageous if not insane, but Bungie knows how to light a fire under your rear end when it comes to keeping gamers coming back for more.  And they send out a bevy of challenges on a daily and weekly basis to give players the opportunity to gather some extra scratch from the various game modes.  Thanks, guys.  But still, the prices hurt.  Do I really want to spend ALL my hard-earned credits getting Cortana's voice in Firefight mode when I'm still eyeing that sweet black visor that'd make me look like the biggest bad@z$ in the galaxy?  Can't have it all, I suppose.  Speaking of Firefight, the perpetual deathfest mode that debuted in ODST has been revamped with a time limit, matchmaking (thank GOD), and extreme customization options.  In a word: perfect.

So now we have more customization than ever and a more skill-based rating system.  But what's different about the GAME, man?!  Two words: armor abilities.  No more picking up power-ups like Super Mario Brothers.  Various game modes give you loadout options with various combinations of weapons as well as a rechargeable superpower.  First off is the long-overdue jetpack, which speaks for itself.  Then there is the hologram, which allows you to send a false double of yourself running to a point of your choosing.  This is perfect for distracting noobs and dealing with snipers.  Active camouflage renders you mostly invisible and scrambles enemy radar (as well as your own) for stealth maniacs.  Armor lock allows you to become temporarily invulnerable at the cost of being unable to move or act.  Great for defensive-minded players who don't mind acting as bait for their flanking teammates. Also good for D is the drop-shield, which is modified from Halo 3.  There are also dashing and rolling abilities that allow you to juke and sprint to cover (or the best weapons) that are helpful to more traditional players not interested in fancy gimmicks.  Something for everyone.  These abilities add an extra layer of strategy and challenge to a game that was never hurting for either and I can't applaud their addition enough.  To all opposed......well, the new Call of Duty is right around the corner.  One of the coolest (albeit smaller) additions to gameplay is the option to assassinate your enemy when you approach him from behind.  These animations are varied and cool as hell.  Sure, you could just hit them with the butt of your rifle and move on, but nothing beats getting your hands bloody and stabbing a jerk in the head with your survival knife.

The weapons have been rebalanced and some replaced for what is clearly the best Halo arsenal yet.  Dual-wielding has been removed, and I find I don't much miss it.  Each weapon is deadly in it's own way and being able to choose loadouts means that you don't always have to hunt for your favorite depending on what mode you play.  The most controversial point was the replacing of the fan favorite headshot machine known as the Battle Rifle (BR) in favor of the semi-automatic Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR).  While many Halo fans sobbed long and hard over this, I always found the BR to be a dull, robotic weapon that was spammed TO DEATH. The DMR is dynamic, powerful, and rewards patience.  While you can shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger, the reticule bloom simulates recoil and requires you to pace your shots to retain maximum accuracy whereas the BR always paced the shots for you like your mommy holding your hand when you cross the street. If you are one of those who complains that the DMR makes the game less skillful, you are probably not as good as you thought you were.  Adaptation is a skill as well.  Learn it.  And Reach is a game that rewards adaptability very much.  With so many ways for your opponent to get the better of you, this is no longer the game you could play in your sleep.  Deal.

My only complaint with Halo: Reach (aside from the embarrassing immaturity of the online community) is that the big maps are poorly designed.  They even ruined my all-time favorite (Blood Gulch/Coagulation/Valhalla, now known as Hemorrhage). This makes Invasion mode -which pits a team of 6 Spartans against 6 Covenant Elites in a progressive objective-based battle- much less fun than it should be.  Allowing players to vote on game modes was great, but Halo is overdue for the ability to search for games based on type.  There are too many players who vote in packs for SWAT (or as I call it, Call of Duty) or sniper matches (Ghost Recon) over traditional Halo games, which are what I buy the game to play.  Why play Halo at all when you clearly want to be playing another shooter entirely?  One of the mysteries of the gaming universe, I guess.  Maybe Call of Duty: Black Ops will have a sci-fi mode with energy shields, motion detectors, sticky grenades, and the like and those same players will always vote to play those modes in that game.  Hey, it could happen.

In conclusion, fanboys will gush, malcontents will insist Halo 3 was better even though they still choose to play this one for 10 hours a day instead, and Reach will see a very long shelf life.  Meanwhile, millions of virtual avatars will lose their lives, friendships and rivalries will be forged in the heat of online combat, buddies will join forces to take on the Covenant again and again, and the Halo juggernaut will march on and on.  So shall it ever be, even with the original developers gone from the franchise that they made into a billion dollar industry unto itself.  Thanks for all the good times, Bungie.  May your noobs be forever pwned."
168092,5,"A lot of people are saying this is strikingly similar to COD4: Modern Warfare, and it is.  That's what's good about it.  COD4 was one of the best games.  There were so many battles of WW2 that they need to keep making games like this.  All in all, this is a very fun game, of course the single player is a little easy, but still fun.  The multiplayer online and even coop are amazing features.  Really, I'd suggest this to someone who got burnt out on COD4 but still wanna have just as much fun playing it with a new feel."
406349,5,"One of the best games I've ever played. Without a doubt. Truthfully trying to explain the game wouldn't do it any justice. Buy the game and play it, you will love it."
306676,5,"An omnipresent and wise view of important archetypal stories. Challenging for all the right reasons and enthralling all the while. Way to go creators.

80486,5,"While paling this game I thought to myself ""Wow, why didn't they make their MMO EXACTLY like this?  It would have actually been fun!"".  The initial concept of this game had me scratching my head, but once you get use to it it's amazing."
55506,5,"This game is old enough now that I'll bother reviewing it since anyone viewing this is a hardcore Star Wars fan looking to complete a game collection.

This game puts you in the shoes of a squad commander of the advanced group of an advanced group of clone troopers known traditionally to fans as ARC troopers. Republic Commando doesn't have any Jedi force powers or anything that you would expect from a Star Wars game, instead you have a squad based tactical shooter set in the story between EP2 and EP3. Back in the day when I first got this game I was huge into the Ghost Recon and R6 games for Xbox and this game basically rips bits off from both of them but it has the added bonus of being set in the star wars universe. Your clones are faceless and never take off their helmets, the armor is huge and bulky and color coded so they all kinda look like gun totting power rangers on steroids but the gameplay is solid, more than solid, your troops obey you and don't do stupid stuff like charging into a room full of baddies only to get themselves snuffed. In this day and age there are better games, but if you like Star Wars, and wanted to know what it was like for the clones instead of the jedi during the clone wars then this would be the game for you.

PS graphically this game still looks quite nice. Xbox games don't show age nearly as much as some PS2 games."

20717,5,"When I first started getting into audio/video at age 16, I spent all of my money on stereo equipment and then financed my car for all of high school.  The guy I bought my system from was a friend, and he recommended monster cable. He showed me the differences between cheap and Monster, and I always buy monster's best products now.  I won't settle for anything less.  The difference on a good system is extraordinary!  The view on the TV is crystal clear, the colors are more vivid, and the contrast is great.  The sound quality improves a ton, as so much more detail appears to be present. You can tell that in the improved channel separation.  Monster's 400's are always the best of their midrange products, and that's what I use.  If I wasn't in college, I'd be using the most expensive stuff they sell.  I know it sounds like I must work for them, but no, I am just a college student.  To anyone who says that expensive cables aren't worth it, either you don't care about the quality of audio/video, or you haven't been exposed to the benefits in a proper system.  Seriously Recommended. Don't Buy anything less."
81294,5,"I am very pleased with not only this product, and with the seller as well. I use to play this game on the NES game system way back in the late 80's early 90's, and it's just as fun and challenging as I remember. I ordered this on a weekend and it delivered 2 days later, and with a bonus of 2 extra games. I will definitely order from this seller in the future."
130945,5,"I got this charger in 2009; it is still working in the end of 2013 as well as the day I bought it.  The batteries still hold a charge; I have never played until dead recently, just toss the controller back on the charger when I'm done, so they last at least 4 hours still.  The only time I have experienced grabbing a controller and there was no charge was when I had left a controller on the charger for 9 months (school) and not used them, but all I had to do was pick it up and place it back on the charger and it started charging it again."
128827,5,"I bought this as an extra cable for my Wii U. We had a family get together recently and they wanted me to bring my Wii U over, but my parents' tv is older and does not have HDMI ports.

I'm normally skeptical of buying off brands, but this cable does everything that it's supposed to do and works like a champ. Very good value for the money spent.

TIP: When using an a/v cable for the Wii U, you have to go into the Wii U settings on the game pad and manually switch the output from HDMI to A/V. A lot of the people who gave this cord 1 star said that the cords didn't work and just showed a black screen. I wonder if this was their problem."

186001,5,"This game is the best game i have ever played in my adult life.  Better than WoW during burning crusade.  Better than every other joker mmorpg WoW clone that has come out just about every week since 2004.  Better than every single xbox joke and ps3 joke game (although ps3 was good and much better than xbox, xbox is a full fledged joke).  This game brings back all the little things that go unnoticed to most... but absolutely loved and immortalized in the memories of true gamers, adventure lovers, story appreciators, and generally sensible people.  The soundtrack is AMAZING too.  Not once during my entire MMO career (which started with WoW) have I listened to the game soundtrack.  I've always had a media player open.  When I play this game, I get tempted to buy the soundtrack (in order to further support the game) and listen to it in my car, or while I do other things on the computer.  Buy this game immediately.  If you already reviewed this game, and gave it anything less than 5 stars, i honestly don't think you should play video games anymore because you clearly don't understand what makes them so great.  This game defines what makes video games great.  Hats off to the developers.  Cheers."

59281,5,"Burnout has been one of the most suprising video game series ever since the release of the original Burnout nearly 3 years ago.  The combination of high-speed racing and the ability to create some serious havoc when you crash has made both Burnout and Burnout 2: Point of Impact suprise hits.  Now that the duties of the Burnout series have been passed down from the now-defunct Acclaim Games to the hands of EA (Electronic Arts)Games, the question of what would happen with future volumes in the series is answered with Burnout 3: Takedown.

Takedown takes a few old things that have been Burnout standards and adds a few lovely new twists.

One such is the Boost Meter, which fills whenever you make smart and slick driving moves during the race like nearly missing other cars, drifting (taking a curve or turn without gas/braking and leting your momentum carry you through it), driving in oncoming traffic, catching air off huge hills, and causing other racers to crash, which is now referred to as a Takedown.  Now the meter is available to use all race long as long as you make sure that you fill it, whereas in the previous games you had to fill it completely to use it.

Another new twist is called Aftertouch, which is like Bullet Time for a crash.  The instant you crash, you can go into a slow-mo crash mode and use the analog stick to direct your wreck to hit any other racer's car, causing a Takedown.  The only downside is that if you take a racer down, that racer is going to go gunning for you to take YOU down.

Several new modes are added to the experience as well, including Road Rage (use your car to commit as many Takedowns as possible within a time limit), Eliminator races (Racers in last place is eliminated, natch), A fun new Crash Mode (try to create huge pile-ups and score serious cash), Special Event Races, Face-Off races to win new cars, Grand Prix races and more.

And some of the crashes you cause (or get caught in) are lovely to see (I had one where I literally made a car crash into the top of a very tall streetlight)and the graphics show that EA definitely took the ball and ran for a touchdown (or should I say Takedown) with it. If you want to have a little fun or release a little road rage while waiting for Gran Turismo 4, then get ready for a little Takedown!"
394310,5,This was a free add on when I bought a Playstation 4. I believe it is normally $100 which is a good deal because you get the game and a guitar. They have completely redone this game and it's awesome! Definetly more difficult than previous versions. This was shipped from Amazon so of course it was packaged well and arrived on time. Gotta love my Amazon Prime.
16673,5,"One of my favorite games of the PS1 era. A little bit wackier & stranger than previous installments (kind of a staple of 90s Sony games, going off of the Spyro, Crash Bandicoot & MediEvil franchises) but still just as good. But, I have to admit, it is the easiest in the original Trilogy.

If you have trouble with the Speedway/ Flight levels in the previous games, I suggest starting with the ones in this game & working backwards. The Flight levels in the original are the hardest. Also has largely abandoned the idea of secret areas by loudly broadcasting their presence with side portals. Also the only one of the original games that have different playable characters. There are whole levels dedicated to Shiela the Kangaroo, St. Byrd (a flying, missile launching penguin), Bentley the Yeti, Agent 9 (a crazed monkey with a laser gun) & Sparx the dragonfly (complete his levels & gain a slew of brand new abilities) Also a whole slew of side missions that are playable by the former four characters, as well as Hunter the Cheetah. Also, the only game in the original trilogy that has a legitimately fulfilling bonus world full of challenging side games- a reward for completing the main game 100%."

I have had 2 ps3's for about 7yrs. 1st one yellow ringed.

I really wanted to try some xbox exclusives and thanks to reviews I was pretty sure that the xbox is realiable now.

Anyway I have had mine for about 2 wks and playing the witcher 2.  Great system and game.  The system is quieter than my ps3 slim 160gb and the loading times and updates seem much quicker,  The updates were constant with the ps3.

I am happy with the system.

Also I like the xbox big controller.  The ps3 one was to small for a mans hands.

462649,5,Seriously you don't know what to do when the game is slow its a strategy game duh think think of the next possible move is chess isn't about fast pace take your time to think of your next 30 moves are by the time the pieces stop moving you could possibly imagine how are you going to check mate since when was chess fast anyways take advantage of the slownes of the pieces moving
199288,5,"I just finished Risen and knew I had to write a review about it. I didn't quite expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. I was absorbed pretty much from the beginning. The story itself is interesting, though not necessarily what will keep you playing. The strongest aspects of the game are the various characters, relationships, factions, etc. that add an extra layer of depth to the game. It's a pretty large game that definitely requires an investment of time and effort to play, but if you're an RPG player, it's worth it.

Probably my biggest complaint is that it is the type of game that requires (or at least is greatly aided by) some external research before beginning. It helps a great deal to know in advance which faction you want to join, how you will spend Learning Points, and which quests to do first so you don't block them out later. It also helps to know little details like eating 10 apples or 10 eggs gives +1 to strength, but only for a maximum of +5. You will also need to find potion and item recipes at fan websites, because there's really no other way to know how to do these things. In other words, it's the kind of game that you could hurt yourself later on if you don't know in advance how things work and what you want to do with your character. Perhaps it's not as big of a deal as I may think it is (in other words, I'm sure the game is still perfectly playable, if not necessarily as easy), but I think most people will enjoy knowing ahead of time what needs to be done in certain situations. Just check out fan sites or the official forums for some of this information.

I never had any technical problems, just one bugged quest where an NPC didn't show up where he needed to be. But after reloading a few times, it worked properly. Some people complain about the game being too dark (mainly on the Xbox), but I will say that at night it does get rather dark. But it was the same in Gothic 2, so I don't think it's a problem specific to this game.

Overall, I'd give the game 4.5 stars for its depth and for the way it completely sucked me into its story and world. Highly recommended for RPG players, especially (but not limited to) the hardcore type.

Edit: Installed and ran perfectly on Windows 7 64-bit."
81662,5,"Now I gotta say I loved this game. I really did and I thought it was a fantastic idea and well executed all around. The first truly innovative game I have seen in years. They actually came up with new ideas and implemented them without making them completely incomprehensible. I am not a fan of EA the corporation but I sure am of some of the people coming up with new ideas that work for them.

 I never read the reviews for this thing before I bought it and thats a good thing in this case because those other reviews have personal axes to grind. Go read some of my other reviews and you can tell I am a real person. Read theres and you will see they are some fanatical anti-security people on a mission to stop the inevitable. The one thing thats very good about their efforts is stopping the pay-per-activation BS that started with Microsoft and demonstrates a profound greed of those making the software at the highest levels. The rest of their fight is stupid. One persons opinion.

 Anyway I am sure this review will get drowned out in the overwhelming chorus but the game still is great. It has serious long term potential for expansions, too, and I hope to see many.

 And BTW I did take one creature all the way to the end...took some doing and it was a fun, fun, oh-so-fun ride the whole way :))"
94024,5,"I wish all controllers had a cool stream effect on them because it really helps keep your hands cool from all the sweat while playing.  This controller is great and the price is on par with the quality.  Only selling mine because I no longer have any games for the PC, or I would use it.  Works amazing for racing games and good for flight games.  Not good for FPS games though."

289924,5,"I played Diablo and Diablo II on the PC, and was dissapointed to hear about how Blizzard had rolled out Diablo III. The computer version had issues with its DRM initially, and the cash auction house also apparently left a sour taste in peoples' mouths, so much so that I was going to take a pass (let's leave aside, for now, the issue of trying to run this game on my potato of a computer). The PS3 version, however, works flawlessly, and there's no cash auction house.

Onto the game itself: If you've played the first two entries in this series, you'll catch on quick. Combat has been steamlined a bit, as has inventory (60 fixed slots instead of having to Tetris your items into position). The game is broken into four acts, each with a distinct visual style and color pallette, which is a refreshing change. Town Portals and waystones make travelling a breeze. There's also plenty of replayability, with randomized maps and dungeons, increasing difficulty, and plenty of classes to play as. Diablo III also includes a ""proper"" rogue-like element, called Inferno mode, where your character has one life, death being final. Finally, the story is also about what I've come to expect from the series, which is a good thing."

55613,5,"Many gamers (and reviewers on this site) have said that the GTA series couldn't be matched for its innovative style and free-roaming play.  So what happens when you take a GTA-style scenario and virtually cross it with the real-world situation of Operation Enduring Freedom?  You get the new game Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction.

In this game, you play as one of 3 mercenaries who have been chosen for a special mission: A United Nations-like group has to stop a madman in North Korea named Song who has control of a very powerful nuclear arsenal targeting the world. An unprecedented $100 million dollar bounty has been placed on Song's head and the heads of 51 other compatriots known as the ""Deck of 52"" (see how this relates to real world situations?)  You are dropped into the country and your search for Song begins.

Your job is to make contact with the factions in the area and try to gather the intelligence information needed to take down the Deck.  The first 12 ""cards"" in each suit are pretty much open season, meaning as you travel around the map to complete your missions if you see anyone of them in the area, you can take them down to collect their bounties and use the money for supplies, but keeping in mind that killing them gives you only half the bounty.

But for the 4 ""Aces"" you need to collect enough intel to gain special clearance to go after them, and trust me it won't be as easy as you would think.

Graphics are not really all that bad for this game but be honest, would you really care about the graphics when this game gives you virtually free reign to shoot any weapon, take any vehicle that is near you and destroy anything and EVERYTHING that is in your path?  COME ON!

All in all, this is one Playground that you definitely will want to play in..."

346077,5,"This is great.  I like the feature of running your cable box through it.  The voice commands for off and on work great and turn everything off and on if you want it. (TV, Cable Box, etc)

The menu layout is confusing to figure out how to make adjustments on the system.  I think they could improve upon that a lot.

Great to get Titanfall, a good game, but still a blast to play.  It is a bit basic and the match making is unbalanced.  As a newbie I was put in a room with people maxed out.

I like this a lot and think the new controllers are outstanding."

60753,5,"My previous game pad was clunky and unresponsive. I'd play a game that I would normally do well in with no problem using a console controller, and get stomped because the pad was so bad. So I went online, and looked at other options for game pads and came across the Logitech Precision game pad. I read the reviews, and everyone said it was great. And at the low price of ten bucks, I decided to try it out. Let me tell you, this pad is a great way to spend ten bucks if you play games on your computer. The buttons are extremely responsive. In a section of a game I died at least 20 times in before giving up on with my old game pad, I completed it without dying once using the Logitech Precision.

In conclusion, this game pad is definitely worth every penny."

I believe Marvel Ultimate Alliance is the best 4 player game available. 4 kids can sit down and play this for hours on end. (It's even better than MUA 2 for this in my opinion.)
Since you get two very good games for one low price it is an outstanding value."

345337,5,"After playing Thieves In Time for a bit, I got an itch to play this collection, and I certainly got my money's worth!

The graphics take a step up from the least pretty (Thievious Raccoonus), more visually impressive (Band of Thieves), to pure, visually spactacular graphics (Honor Among Thieves). These PS2 remasters are definitely fun, are perfect for the Vita, and have become one of my favorite series exclusive to PlayStation; and I've only played the first level on each game.

All in all, this remastered collection is worthy of being in your Vita library. 5/5.

P.S. I have this on download, so the three games will download separately from each other. And mind that you have enough memory on your memory card: all three games will take up a total of over 6 gigs."

174645,5,"There have been many Batman games but not many good ones, Batman: Arkham Asylum is the first game where you feel like Batman and you get to do all the things Batman can do, you really become the detective and caped crusader that is Batman. This game really has a sence of darkness and the story line is perfect for this type of game. If you are not sure about it then download the demo because if you don't try that you really are missing out on a great game.
Plot: The game begins with Batman capturing the Joker after his latest plot and escorting him to Arkham Asylum for imprisonment. Due to the Joker's recent attack on Gotham's Blackgate Prison, a large number of sane convicts have been transferred. However, the Joker, with the help of Harley Quinn, frees all the inmates and closes Arkham Asylum with Batman and Commissioner Gordon inside. Joker then threatens to detonate bombs all around Gotham if someone tries to enter the building. Batman must uncover the full extent of the Joker's plan while contending with the horrors of Arkham and was not expecting much from the game because I had mixed feelings about the demo. But as soon as I put the full game in, it freaking blew my away. The graphics and presentation suddenly hit me when I began to play the intro of Arkham Asylum. They made the visuals and it surroundings so believable that I thought I really had Batman in my grasp to controle. It is obvious from the start that the developers put sweat and tears into the game. Every chapter of Arkham Asylum is well thought out and realized. The gadgets aren't just there for show, they make you use them because of the well crafted level design. The free flow combat is great but if you can produce some combos and add some gadgets and moves into the mix, the hand to hand combat becomes even better. In conclusion, I will quote IGN by saying ""Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time."" That is a bold statement but i truly believe that the game deserves it."
160100,5,"I love this series. I have finished the storyline once, played the multiplayer, and most of the downloadable content. It's a good buy if you liked the first one."

Game fighting mechanics haven't change much still really good, the Story is really interesting and the submission really good
you can feel the stress of the night as enemies and missions appear at your surroundings
DO NOT let comments about the Bat Mobile let you know, People love to complain but RockSteaty has given us 4 installments of Batman and this is the 1st one with the Bat Mobile, so yes, there is NOT MUCH Bat Mobile if you have enjoy this Franchise, but yes the Bat Mobile is a key player on this game, So What? There is a WAR in the City and it fits perfectly well.
Yes there are plenty of missions with the car but they all make sense (perhaps the The Riddler not much)
you can still move on foot or do whatever you like"

341970,5,"I bought this Clip for mounting the XBox One Kinect Sensor on a 80"" Vizio m801-a3 TV, and considering some reviews and the price, I suspected it to be a cheap quality item, suitable for temporary use.
However: the item is actually of a better build quality than expected.
Unpacking and mounting was super easy, and it fits very nice on my Vizio TV (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F5OEOKS/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=).
Since the mount feels pretty solid, I'll leave the sensor mounted permanently.
For those worried about seeing your Kinect fall off the TV: unless someone is seriously bumping into the TV or pulling the cords, this won't happen.
If you're still worried though, consider something like velcro to keep it in place."

142494,5,"I had my doubts about this game -- especially after seeing a picture of the included controllers.  However, I stand corrected.  This was one of the best game purchases that I've made this year.  The game is very fun, and has been a hit with my family.  Also, the tracking of the questions/puzzles and the variety of categories makes for an exciting and lasting experience.

For the price of a normal game, you get 4 wireless buzzer controllers, batteries, and a USB wireless controller IR port.  Definitely worth it after you consider how much you actually get with the game.

I'm hoping that MS decides to expand the experience in 2 ways: 1) Through downloadable content through their Live service (in the form of new questions or puzzle types) and 2) Creates new trivia games that can utilize the same controller setup.

Scene It! is a pleasant surprise for Xbox 360 gamers who want to add some casual family/friends gaming to their system (especially for those who don't own a Wii).  I hope that people buy this game just to show MS that there is a viable market for quality party games on the Xbox 360, and encourages them to release other great trivia titles."
124741,5,"Acrobatic and electric, inFamous is fun from beginning to end.  After a mysterious accident gives him his awesome electrical powers and destroys most of the city, protagonist Cole must navigate his way through the ruins of the city to unravel the mystery behind the destruction and what part he played in it.  I use the term protagonist because Cole does have several opportunities to choose which moral path he can follow.  He can choose to be benevolent and use his powers to save his fellow citizens or intimidate and crush those that oppose him.  The story essentially follows the same arc regardless of which moral choices you pick but some of the subplots and side missions will be affected by those choices.  Either way you will end up will a truly awesome array of powers and the chance to roam the decimated city at your leisure.  One thing that the creators did note, and that I found on my playthoughs, is that the hero path is more difficult.  There are more defensive/escort missions on that path and collateral damage can be your worst enemy.  The tight free-running controls and intense powers make this a real pleasure to play.  Highly recommended."

444187,5,"I have never been an Xbox player, I had a 360 until it got the Red Ring of Death, and until now that is the only Xbox I have ever owned. I have owned every Playstation there has been, but lately I have not been all that thrilled with my PS4 so I decided to add an Xbox One S to my home theater setup and I am glad that I did. Let me first say that games that are available on both systems seem to run just about the same on the Xbox One S as they do on my PS4, however I am really liking the exclusives that Xbox has, I am looking forward to getting my hands on a copy of Gears of War 4. The user interface on the Xbox One S does seem a bit sluggish at times, but it is nothing that I can't live with and it is most likely from jumping from one app/game to another without actually quitting the app/game. The ability to connect your cable or satellite box directly to your Xbox One S and have a nice seamless experience is a cool feature, however I would like them to add a sleep timer to the Xbox One S so that I can set it to shut off in case I fall asleep while watching TV at night. I have been assured by many that the Xbox One S is completely safe to leave on overnight, but I have not been able to bring myself to do that with such a new purchase that I am still being very cautious with. I am also very pleased with how quiet the Xbox One S is compared to my PS4, sometimes my PS4 sounds like it is trying to launch into outerspace and has had a noise issue since I bought it, the Xbox One S is whisper quiet and I have NEVER heard the machine while playing a game or using any of the apps and I hear my PS4 all of the time."

60546,5,"The PlayStation 2 got a decent dose of bloody Roman history earlier this year with Shadow of Rome, a more or less playable version of the movie Gladiator. However, Sony has completely upped the ante with God of War, an adventure of Herculean proportions that brilliantly plays off Greek mythology and delivers one of the most intense gaming experiences of the year.

The game's premise is as ancient as the mythos itself: Ares, the titular deity with serious self-esteem issues, has gone on a rampage and must be stopped. Being Greek gods (who are prone to sit on their eternal asses and empower others to do their dirty work), a mortal dutifully takes up the task: Kratos, a tortured Spartan warrior who can pry off Gorgon heads, tear some enemies completely in half, and perform other super-human feats. Formidable as Kratos' strength is, the only thing that can kill Ares is Pandora's Box, an artifact resting behind a series of bosses, devilishly constructed traps, and perplexing puzzles (most of which come in the form of moving objects and pulling levers).

Borrowing perhaps a bit too liberally from Devil May Cry (the first one, anyway), Kratos is a serious-minded one-man slaughterhouse, sans the oh-so-cool swagger. Equipped with a pair of extending chains each capped with a sword, the Spartan uses these weapons for mid-range combo attacks, including vicious air-juggles. Larger foes, though, require more skill, and some must be softened up before they can be finished off by a series of onscreen button-press cues. Additional combos are unlocked by cashing in dead souls collected from felled enemies. Accessory weapons are also available. For instance, once you wrench off Medusa's head, it can be used as a power-up to temporarily petrify enemies that can then be shattered if struck before they can thaw. The gods chime in, too, and dole out various devastating powers, such as Zeus' lightning bolts and Hades' dead souls.

Robust fighting engine aside, God of War draws additional strength from the sheer diversity of tasks to be completed and the clever way it plays off the source material. Classic monsters, such as the Hydra, Minotaur, Sirens, and Harpies (among others) require specific techniques in order to defeat as the events take place against a driving music score reminiscent of the best Roman movie sagas like Ben-Hur. The excellent visuals bring these foes to life and the detailed architecture deliver the aesthetic punch of an era long gone.

All is not perfect on Olympus, though. The inconsistent camera (that destroyer of other games) takes its toll as it makes seemingly simple tasks like navigating lengthy catwalks more perilous than it should be, and some of the puzzles rely excessively on split-second timing and result in repetitive trial-and-error.

Setbacks aside, God of War is an exhausting, epic quest that challenges the mightiest video game warrior from the throne of their living-room couch."
336348,5,The best story of any game i've ever seen!
369419,5,It's certainly not the best game ever but it's engaging and i can't stop playing it.  It's especially fun if played with others to complete the more challenging missions / raids.  I play mostly by myself and still find it enjoyable.
403279,5,"Amazing. I could write a long review here, but it's not necessary. If you're into this type of open-ended game with a great story, it's a must have."
1005,5,"Ever since I purshased GOLDENEYE 007 on the old N64, I became highly addicted to it, like many other gamers around the world. I also have to thank this game as well, because it made me a hardcore James Bond fan.
This is the best first-person shooting game ever! Although dated, the detail of this game is amazing. There's over 14 levels of shooting! My favorite missions are the first level, the Silo mission, the Train mission, and the very last level.
Highly recommended game; it fuels the senses! If you like James Bond, or any type of video game, get it! Mostly all of you have."

204926,5,"In my opinion, BAC will prove to be one of the best video games ever made.

Like Arkham Asylum, the core mechanics revolve around brawling, stealth takedowns and open-world action.  The chain fighting is simple to learn, yet difficult to master.  With a little proficiency, the game effectively gives you the exhilarating feeling that you've just beat up a room full of dudes.  However, to really excel at the combat, it takes some practice.  The stealth ""predator"" rooms pit the dark knight against a bunch of armed thugs.  Since they have guns, you can't just take them out head-on.  Rather, you've got to take them out one by one, retreating into the walls or atop gargoyles to stay out of sight.  You're an invisible predator, and as you take down more enemies, the ones remaining start to freak out.  It's really quite amusing.

Unlike Arkham Asylum, the game is more open world.  There are side-missions you can engage in whatever order you like.  Where unnecessary to complete the story, these side missions are critical to leveling up more powerful attacks and armor.  Not to mention that they're simply fun.

Play as Catwoman.  Catwoman missions could stand-alone as its own game.  Where the controls are congruent to Batman (so you don't have to learn a whole new combat mechanic) she has her own style and way of moving and fighting that's quite a bunch of fun.  It's also fun playing a character with a more mercenary sensibility.

But the over-arching quality that makes this game so terrific is that every aspect of it is FUN.  Recently I've played games (like LA NOIRE) that, in my opinion, have oodles of technical merit but just aren't any fun.  Batman is an exhilarating, no-sleep, kill-your-weekend thrill ride from start to finish.

If you've just bought your PS3 system, do yourself a solid and make BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY (along with Uncharted 2 and Bioshock) your first purchase."

29987,5,"I'm a veteran roleplayer with several decades of experience in face-to-face, MUSHes, MUDs, MMRPGs and CRPGs.  For a heckuva long time I said that no computer game would ever be able to replicate the freedom of choice and meaningful context necessary to play a role properly.  Most CRPGs rely on more or less scripted paths and a great deal of meaningless combat filler.  CRPG roles are defined in terms of battle effectiveness not in terms of intrinsic outlooks, motives, techniques and goals.
There are some exceptions - games like Darklands, Arkania, Planescape: Torment and Morrowind's predecessor Daggerfall tried to offer more interesting settings or a greater degree of freedom.  Ultimately, though, setting seemed to come at the price of freedom - well defined NPCs and carefully constructed stories limited how much latitude a designer could grant a player.  When freedom was stressed, the story appeared nebulous and a huge cast of walk-on interchangeable NPCs tended to blend together.  MMRPGs, MUDs, and MUSHes all have their own weaknesses and issues as real roleplaying vehicles but that's a very different topic than the single player game.
Morrowind is the first solo player game, ever, to truly reconcile setting, story and the freedom to make the kinds of decisions that really define a character.  The setting of Vvardenfell is a complex world - an unwilling member of a multicultural Imperial commonwealth much like Rome.  The factions and factions within factions both amongst the natives and the colonists is Byzantine and dramatic.  Both Imperial and Dunmer cultures are explored in detail with not only articulated NPCs using a very sophisticated dialogue system, incredible graphics and architecture, but entire libraries of books written by folks holding quite a few divergent opinions.  Even theology, ecology, and economics are considered as part of the background and often form the basis of the conflicts your character gets drawn into.
So who is your character that gets drawn into the world of Morrowind?  A nameless prisoner convicted of crimes left vague, released by fiat of The Emperor to complete a unknown mission.  Upon disembarking from the ship, and after stopping to oogle the gorgeous world from shore, you're ushered through character creation in the guise of answering the local provost's questions.  You have three options.  Answer a series of 'psychological' profile questions that result in a character class tailored to your style of problem solving.  Pick a class from a list of premade types that should each work rather well.  Lastly, you can define a character from scratch - picking out individual skills and statistics to invent your own vision.  In addition to picking a race, you also can pick sex, facial features and hairstyle.  Combined with a dizzying array of clothing and armor options eventually available you'll likely end up with a very striking persona.
You're unceremoniously ushered out with the directions to look around town and equip before setting off to meet with an Imperial agent in another city.
That's where the roleplaying begins.  You'll run into all sorts of characters with different agendas and agendas at cross purposes.  A decision you make concerning one may affect your relations with a whole cross-section of folks associated with him.  Are you a thief?  Steal anything you want but expect the law to chase you if you're spotted.  And don't try selling stolen goods to merchants that know the previous owner.  Scout?  Perhaps you'll talk to the bartender of the local tavern and get your bearings on the local geography.  Do gooder?  Plenty of decent folks need help.  Thug?  The criminals need help too.  Over time, as you learn more about the setting, you'll find yourself taking sides with one or more of the dozens of factions represented.
But time is on your side.  Witchhunter, enchanter, archer or alchemist your skills will improve as you use them and as you explore ruins and lairs or simply complete missions for your factional patrons.  What skills you chose, how you improve them and whom you make as an enemy or a friend really do allow a player to roleplay.  A rogue will be more successful charming or swindling his way around challenges.  A crusader will likely take a more direct approach.  But a crusader affiliated with the Triumvirate Temple of the local Dunmer will have very different missions and goals than a crusader allied to the Imperial Cult.  And there are even darker patrons one can serve as the mysteries of the world are slowly rolled back including demon lords and vampire clans.
There are shortcomings.
Combat can be less realistic or action packed.  In true fantasy RPG mold, you spend most of your time in combat juggling buffs, hitpoints and pausing to move items into slots or bring up spells.  Some have complained about the lack of feedback concerning how damaged a foe is.  However, you'll spend alot of time with sweaty palms trying to pull a tough fight off.
You really need a strong system to run this on.  I use a Dell Dimension 8200, 2g Pentium4, 512 megs RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce3 ti 500, with Turtle Beach/Altec Lansing surround sound.  GeForce3 and GeForce4 cards seem to be the best to get a bang out of your buck with Morrowind.  There are reports of lower end systems doing well but this is the game to upgrade for if you're a roleplayer.
There are also reports of miscellaneous bugs and CTDs but I haven't experienced them."

So with no more word, GH METALLICA ROCKS !!!!"

261011,5,"Though I recommend you get it for PC so you can play with mods, it remains one of my favorite ever games. The world building and quest structure play well together."
363381,5,"The game doesn't look much better than the Tomb Raider Definitive edition. I expected that over the years there would be some improvements. That doesn't mean it's ugly by any means! The game is gorgeous! So was TR:DE! Some nice changes like glow sticks add to the realism of the game(It's been a few years since I played the last one, so I don't remember if that had the glowsticks or not..but I think it's new to this chapter of the reboot saga)

The voice acting is great, and the story is amazing! The story centers on Lara searching for the secret to immortality and having to compete against ""Trinity"", which is a secret organization almost like the Illuminati. Like any good adventure story friendships will be made and of course, without spoiling anything: Betrayals will be made.

Overall, if you loved the last Tomb Raider, you're going to love this one too! I did!"

100800,5,"The X-Plorer Rock Band / Guitar Hero Wired Guitar is a solid piece of gaming equipment. We've used ours for years and they play as well now as the day we bought them.

The design for this guitar is simple. Five colored buttons up high. A strum bar and whammy bar. A tilt sensor inside. No special buttons, no fancy silver knobs - and it WORKS. It is a true workhorse. When other guitars we own fail and fall apart, these Xplorers keep on trucking.

The unit is wired, and it has a breakaway connector at the end. One end of that connector has a mouse-style input and the other side is USB to go into the XBox. So make sure, if you're buying used, that it has that connector - otherwise you won't be able to plug it into the 360.

The full length of the cable including that connector is just under nine feet. So fairly short. If your living room is long, or if you have a lot of people moving around between you and the TV while you play, you might want to consider going wireless instead.

It's recommended you don't get an extension cable because that would mess up the timing of your button presses.

The unit is sturdy. You can hammer the buttons and they stay responsive. The strum bar and whammy bar both hold in there. Most impressively, the tilt sensor is sturdy! We have the Stratocasters as well as these Xplorers and the Strats are notorious for having their tilt sensors fail. We've never had any problem with an Xplorer tilt sensor failing.

Are there any down sides here? Well certainly the Xplorer cost a bit more than the Strat does - but there's a reason for that. It lasts longer. So if you're really into the Guitar Hero / Rock Band games you probably want a guitar that will stand up to your pounding. Of course you could always upgrade to the real wood versions, but those get quite pricey. This is a nice mid-range compromise.

It's worth noting, for those new to buying guitars, that they are generally console specific. This one has a green X button on it at the lower left. Make sure you look for that when buying one for your XBox 360. Also note that you can't then use it on your PS3 nor on your Wii.

Well recommended for fans of Guitar Hero / Rock Band who want a reliable, sturdy guitar.

We purchased our X-Plorer guitars with our own funds in order to play our many music games."

112021,5,"The story behind Orochi Musou is relatively simple: a powerful demon melds the world of Shin Sangoku Musou (Dynasty Warriors) and Sengoku Musou (Samurai Warriors). Four musou (story) modes unfold the story of humanity's struggle against the mighty demon Orochi and his armies. The shakiest part of the story is the beginning when Orochi rips apart China and Japan to create a new world of warriors, but everything following that is an interesting tale that mixes up the characters (for veterans) and even for players new to the Musou series, giving an enjoyable bit of mystery that the history-based Samurai Warriors and novel-based Dynasty Warriors don't quite have.
Story: 7.6/10

Koei and Omega Force have been refining their PS2 game engine for a long time, and Warriors Orochi shows it off. Maps range from towering castles (in which you actually enter and navigate the interior) to river-bounded plains, some offering more open space and therefore people on the screen at once but only in the rarest moments will the game slow down (and usually with a 'bullet time' sort of feel effect). Not gorgeous like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-XII/dp/B000F5IH2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy XII</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hack-G-U-Vol-3-Redemption/dp/B000R36ABS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">.hack: G.U., Vol. 3: Redemption</a>&nbsp;but enjoyable nonetheless.
Graphics: 7.9/10

Although I was expecting slightly more from the sounds of a squad of archers raining arrows, everything came across as at least passable. The swords clashing and the sound of magic sputtering does a fair job, though it's the gameplay that will really suck you in and hold you. Voices, music, and effects can be adjusted independently, in case you don't like the music or English voices (there's no option for the Japanese dub, and the voice acting can be over-the-top). There's also an option for subtitles in the FMVs, with speech during battles already having their own text.
Sound: 7/10

The intro song was a great mix of Chinese and Japanese instrumental sound, giving hope that the Musou series will one day eschew the techno/pop-rock that suffocates it so far. Unfortunately, you'll have to keep waiting as only the opening and closing is new and the rest is recycled from earlier Musou games. Unlike Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires, you can't choose which tracks play in your mission, but the music is usually fitting and if you don't like it, you can mute it in the main menu and listen to your own music on your computer or separate stereo.
Music: 3/10

The play is where the Musou series really shines, and Orochi shows that Koei has been refining its engine for years with smooth, action-packed, extremely fun gameplay. Four difficulty levels give plenty of choice between an easy bout of stress-relief or a grueling challenge on Chaos Mode. I've played few other hack-and-slash type games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gauntlet-Dark-Legacy/dp/B00004U5VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</a>, but this game eclipses everything else I've seen. The weapon fusion also makes it easy and fun to build up powerful weapons, rather than hunting-and-hoping like in earlier Dynasty Warriors games. Having control of the camera via the right analog stick also makes it superior to Dynasty Warriors.
Gameplay: 8.9/10

Even after you've beaten all four of the musou modes, you'll have plenty to go back and get by unlocking additional characters (many have special requirements, like Honda Tadakatsu), unique items for each character, and unlocking everything in the art galleries. You can go back and re-play any unlocked missions with anybody you've unlocked in that storyline, or anybody you've unlocked period once you clear the campaign. With over seventy characters to choose from, that's a lot of options. You may want a friend to help you unlock certain characters or unique items, though, ones like Lu Bu's ""Hero Armor"" are virtually impossible to obtain solo.
Replayability: 7.8/10

Whether you call it 'hack and slash' or 'crowd control', this game will deliver many hours of entertainment. Closed-minded people can go ahead and complain that all Musou games are the same, but the series is getting better all the time. Speaking without the tint of nostalgia (this game was my first of the Musou series and having sampled others later), this was the best fun I've had. PS3 owners stuck with the 'lower backwards compatibility' will be pleased to know that this game still runs like a dream, without strange distortions like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-Good-Evil/dp/B00009ZVHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond Good & Evil</a>.

143404,5,"This is the best FPS game that I have ever played.  The maps are really big, but you have vehicles to get around. The enemies are relentless and agressive, the weapons awesome. You have 4 characters to choose from (I'm playing through with the 3rd one now), including a female.
The only complaint is that some of the game is repetetive in that you fight the same enemies over and over each time you go through their territory and you have no choice but to go there to get somewhere else. However, you do get experience points each time you get through.  All in all, this game is great as single player.  I haven't tried team or multiplayer yet."
30196,5,very  good
206114,5,He loves it and the price better than department stores!
22850,5,After playing the current build of the game i was definatly impressed. After EA's last basketball game i didn't have high expectations but EA big has done it again. The thing i like is how simple it is to play at first but you can always get better and there's always some move or combo you havn't done. The graphics are as good as you need for basketball and the framerate is smooth (actually the framerate bites but EA promised that this early build would get much better) The game's 1 player mode is fun and will last you some decent time but the best part of the game is the 2 player modes. Since only 3 people are on a team it is so much easyer to do massive combos with multiple players. Also another thing i liked was the momentum bars. As they fill up your guys start playing better and when its filled all the way every point scored for you also takes one away from your opponent. Also there may be special moves only to be performed when the meter is filled (none were present yet.) Overall if you like basketball you'll love this game... If you don't like basketball you'll like the sport after you relize how fun this game is.
128155,5,"A great headset.  A must own for all PS3 gamers.  The device is extremely comfortable, and within minutes you will not know that it's there behind your ear.  The voices are crystal clear.  The battery lasts around 4 hours long, so you'll need to keep it recharged via the supplied micro USB cable.  I do wish that the battery is bigger, so that the headset will last twice as long between charges.  5 stars either way for such an affordable device."
446601,5,awesome game

477133,5,stuck on a certain level but hopefully on a sober day I will get off that level a lot of fun
252054,5,"Easily the best flight sim on any consoles PERIOD in terms of realism and immersion. Even with the standard PS3 controller this is awesome, the custom mapping is setup so that with any stick or controller you can set the sensitivity, this allows the PS3 sticks to work well with it and it's very responsive. On to the game, the planes are great, a very wide selection, though this is mainly a pacific game they still include a load of Russian and German planes, including a few Australian and Italian ones as well. They all feel different and will handle differently, and the realism is spot-on. Things like the P-39's altitude limits, the Me-163 being spin resistant, planes being able to land in the water, and certain planes not having trimming equipment are all in the game, and the physics work very nicely. Along with this is a strong online playerbase spanning all difficulties(realistic, simulator, simplified),a great decal system including common phrases and a sizable amount of emblems from real WW2 squads, and custom schemes from real WW2 squads(excluding Japan, there are decals but no squadron emblems). Online has a few gamemodes, the most interesting being one where the goal is to land on an airfield and capture it while the enemy is subsequently trying to land and shoot you, and a sort of base vs base game where a skilled bomber can make a big difference. If you don't want to play online, there is free flight where you can fly around and practice landing in different conditions and a mission editor where you can customize exactly what you want to do. This game is very realistic and has a huge curve, and even after dozens of hours and 80+ missions on simulator mode landing is still challenging, this game is 40 dollars brand new but easily better than most 60 dollar titles. My only gripe with this game is that a few planes lack cockpits, every fighter, even the funky German ones, have cockpits-excluding a few bombers including the B-17E,G and all other heavy American bombers(including the Catalina). Most Russian bombers do have cockpis, including the Il-2 and If I remember correctly the Il-10. The only 2 seater bomber with a cockpit in it is the Mosquito. Also the Stuka doesn't have the siren. However, these are extremely minor unless flying that B-24 in cockpit view is absolutely mandatory for you. Also the single player campaign is pretty good, with cutscenes and backdrops to major battles, though it isn't 100% to the end of the pacific campaign it includes Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Wake Island, and Pearl Harbor. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants a realistic simulator on a console, this is a PC quality sim and that doesn't come around very often on consoles"
378112,5,Great collection. Was expecting the figure to be bigger and the same with the box it came in but it's nice overall.
374538,5,Whenever I am done playing games I easily put the controller on here. I used to have to buy a new pack of batteries every other week but never again!

88226,5,Got it for a bday present
46321,5,"OK, I've played PnP D&D since I was 1st interested in reading - actually D&D is what got me interested in reading in the first place...but anyways, I've also played (or tried playing) most PC RPG's out there including the hit titles of 2002 - Morrowind and Dungeon Siege, and NWN is by far the best you can get. First off, if you want Hack and Slash RPGing, you can download as many Hack and Slash modules off of NWVault.com as your heart desires - even beautiful recreations of Diablo and Diablo2! If you want some cerebral RPGing with plenty of text and quests, well you can download tonnes of D&D PnP module recreations - including titles like ""Keep on the Borderlands"", ""Temple of Elemental Evil"", ""Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh"", etc... There are even accurate recreations of previous Bioware licensed material like Baldur's Gate, Planescape, and Icewind Dale! So when you buy your copy of NWN, your getting a thousand RPG's in one little box - it's that crazy!"
273233,5,Great gift for my grandson.
16064,5,"This game is Great! I got this one a few years ago, and I still play it. I like the fact that, not only can you visit the Johto region, but you can also visit the Kanto region as well, but you can only do that only after you defeat the Elite Four and complete other missions (I forgot what those were, since I haven't played them in a while). Plus, the graphics are much improved over the Red, Blue and Yellow Versions, and I like how they have the Day/Night feature on here... i think that's what I will like about Diamond and Pearl as well. The clock feature is really cool too. You can have this game on the road with you and still know what time it is. I highly recommend this game!"

95341,5,"I managed to snag one of the deals for this product at $60 in December. The reason that I am only now writing this review is because I felt the need to thoroughly test it. At $60 it's a great price, but at $130, no way. One thing you can do is look at the other merchants at Amazon selling this game(look under the like-new section) at a lower price. Now onto the product itself. First of all, the inside of the outer cardboard piece is like a poster of Master Cheif, except for the fact that if you cut it out, master cheif's head or legs are severed. In the box, there is the Halo 3 game disc, Halo Essentials(commentary, making of game, themes for the 360 dashboard and some pics), the Mark VI helmet(does not fit on anyone's head!, and is used as a lid for the container it rests on), a container that can hold the 2 game cases along with another one. The game has an excellent storyline, multiplayer interaction(though I'm not sure how long people will be playing that), and many bonus game add-ons(such as Forge, where you can construct and build your own map, then play on it, and Theater, where you can review and edit any game on halo you've played). My final review is that unless you strongly like the Halo series, don't get this product unless it's under $80."
35690,5,"I loved this game. It was well made and insanely broad in what you could do with it. If you aren't phased by fantasy violence then you'll probably think the game is a lot of fun too. But I will never let my children come within 10 feet of this game and you probably shouldnt either. Here's why.

A fitting retitle of this game would be ""Scarface: the Game"" because that's what a great deal of this game is modeled after, an extremely violent movie about being a drug lord. The game takes place in a realistic coastal city. There are restaurants, beaches, hospitals, hotels, police depts, grocery stores, bars, gas stations. In fact the game was modeled after the locations and sights found in the movie Scarface.

The city is populated with pedestrians, golfers, shoppers, people waiting to get on buses/in cabs, hookers, gang members, strippers, drug dealers, policemen, emergency medical technicians, bums, store cashiers, etc.

You can kill any one of these people.

You can solicit a prostitute, and then run over her with your car as she gets out and leaves, then take the money back that you paid her. You can watch a strip show then shoot the stripper. You can hack a pedestrian up with a chainsaw. Throw a cab driver out of his cab then run him over with it. You can perform drive-by shootings. You can start a gang war. You can walk up to a car, aim a rifle at an innocent driver and shoot them directly in the head and watch them fall out of the driver's seat. You can drive around inside a shopping center and run over the shoppers. You can distribute flyers for adult films that you're producing. You can even start a massacre shooting then as the EMT's come to help people, blow them up with a rocket launcher, or simply beat them to death with a baseball bat. You can become such a threat to the city that the National guard may appear with tanks, helicopters, and infantry. Yes you can kill them too. You don't have to do all this stuff. In fact almost none of it is necessary in completing the main point of the game. You simply have the freedom to do it if you desire to.

Or you could simply go through the basic missions of the game that involve an ex-con's rise to power as a leader of a powerful mafia-type drug cartel a la, you guessed it, Scarface.

Your kid will probably love it. All in all, for what it is, it's extremely well made. Of course if you are worried that violence etc found in video games could negatively affect your child, then you should by no means let them anywhere near it."
315407,5,An excellent successor to the last Smash game.  Tons of characters and levels.  Also Nintendo finally has a semi-decent network that you can actual do online play with.
171917,5,"Lots of fun through out this game. Hard time trying to find all the gold, especially the intel items. Kind of reminds you of call of duty world at war. The graphics were ok, the game play was good as well. Overall a great game, but does not compare to call of duty modern warfare 2. But then again what can?"
186344,5,"Great game to enjoy while deployed, made time go buy quick!"
164814,5,"This game has taken hours and days to play.  Once you start it is addicting and you will need to tell yourself that it is time to go to bed.  There are so many details in the game, so many steps to take, so many things you can do....it seems the game can be played for years.

My wife, kids and I have all played and at times fight for ""whose turn it is""."

You can join in at any time which is nice.  Really fun to play with other people - a great parent-child game.  Kind of like a more action-oriented version of XMen Legends or Marvel Ultimate Alliance.  A good, fun action game - not too deep, but definitely a good time."
411370,5,Excellent & beautiful game.
297013,5,I am still learning the ropes of this game but it is an awesome game to play in HD especially on our big screen tv. :) You feel like you are a part of the movie series.
71587,5,When i got this i thought it would not work. But i went online and read that it fixes the games because it clamps down on the game to read it better. Now every single game that i have works perfectly and my worse game only has blinked a couple times but all i had to do was blow the game out and it worked fine. The only bad thing about this is that it is very hard to take the game out because it clamps so hard. But other than that it works fine.
50828,5,"With all of the WWII games afoot, I was hesitant to buy yet another WWII game.  I was fully expecting a Medal of Honor clone and was pleasantly proven wrong.  Call of Duty allows the player to dive into three different roles - US, British, and Soviet soldiers.  Each country's segment has its own style, look, and rules of engagement (for example, Soviet soldiers who retreat are shot on sight!).  What is great for hardened gamers like myself is that I could kick up the game to a more difficult and more appropriate level for my gaming ability.  The accuracy of the settings and battles is amazing.  The first Soviet mission environment looks like the computer graphic version of the film Enemy at the Gates. All the missions are varied and innovative.  You'll never find yourself on a tedious mission, rushing through to get it over with.  I experienced no bugs or crashes in the game, which is rare these days!  Having other soldiers with you who actually contribute to the gameplay and watch your back was great!  The only annoying thing was when my fellow soldiers would stand too close and I'd get killed because I couldn't duck out of the way.  Move it, Elder!  The only flaw I found with the game was that there wasn't an opportunity to really explore the environment. Also, I never came across any civilians.  I suppose only a WWII historian would know how accurate that is.  All in all, Call of Duty was amazing, refreshing, and fun."
201159,5,"You can read professional reviews, or semi critic reviews, but I am here to tell you that this is a fun zombie killing game.  Not too many of these types of games on the market.  The zombie killing never gets old.  Fun game to play and watch the hours melt away."

65206,5,"Burnout Revenge takes whatever setbacks there were about Burnout 3: Takedown and tweaks them to perfection. In many ways, it is the same game, but adds a lot more to the experience.

Burnout 3 was more about ""Takedowns"", which are the result of your causing your AI opponents to crash in spectacular fashion. The premise of this game is the ""Revenge"" factor. Your goal here is still to cause Takedowns, and win gold medals in every possible event, but now you score points for ""getting revenge"" at those that cause your crash. You go through a rating system starting at ""Harmless"" ending with ""Elite"". By the time you get to Elite mode, you may need a new joystick because the one you were using will probably end up a broken chunk of plastic with wires hanging out of it from throwing it on the ground.

One of the major improvements in Burnout Revenge is you can finally crash into traffic, as long as it isn't an oversized (semi truck or bus) or oncoming vehicle. Another big change is you can now activate the ""Crash Breaker"" in races later on in the game.

Since you can crash into traffic, one of the events you must take part in is ""Traffic Attack"" which is a timed event, where you must speed along and keep the clock moving by hitting vehicles and performing ""trick shots"" by causing vehicles to ricochet into larger oncoming vehicles...etc. The goal here is to rack up enough cash to win a gold medal.

Of course the goal in this whole game is to win gold medals in every event, which will help you advance up the charts and access the further stages. There are 10 stages to complete, each stage has varying tasks of varying difficulty.

This game can be frustrating, as there is no way in real life that half the courses in this game would be allowed to exist on current roads today. Then again, neither would 3/4 of the vehicles you get to drive. The ""Burning Lap"" stages are particularly difficult, as you cannot crash even once if you want a gold medal.

It's a fun game, but not without it's glitches. Your car will sometimes (and frustratingly) drop off the board and into a large white void, much like the ""Loading Program"" where Morpheus explains The Matrix to Neo in the movie. This eats up a lot of precious time. Also, oncoming traffic or opponents will sometimes appear, or disappear out of thin air.

All that aside, it's a very fun and time consuming game, and if you like racing and action games, you will love this one."

Doom, Quake, Turok etc...
I just couldn't get used to the camera view point with any of them.
Then along came Metroid.
UUGH, another FPS with a stupid gun sticking out.

Then just out of curiosity I bought the darn thing and sure enough, this was the first FPS that I actually played all the way through.

Awesome graphics.
Spot on control.
Excellent music.
Everything is spot on perfect for this kind of game.
Yes, I found it difficult and had to resort to the cheat guide many times in order to find all the hidden goodies.

Anything bad?
Meh, I still like third person action games more but for a FPS this one and the other two Metroid games are the only ones I can stand to play.
Oh, and the final boss is a real pain.
Otherwise.....
Metroid Prime comes....recommended."
338289,5,"Just a short review:

Pros:
* A FPS that brings the best of old school shooters, like Doom, Duke and so on: lots of enemies, a basketful of easter eggs, excellent secrets, etc.
* Good story (but who needs it, anyway), couple with very smart writting (very!!).
* Great power-up system, branching into weapons, skills and abilities.
* Quite long.
* Very nice difficulty curve

Cons:
* The music is a bit letdown
* Its a bit dark at a times...
* Sometimes it is very difficult to tell where you have been or where to go.

I bought it for less than 20 bucks, which should be considered the maximum amount of money to pay for this."
286387,5,"I paid $80 for this on the release date, and I see it's now listed at $44.99, but meh.

I'll start with the game. It's pretty much more of the original game, so if you've played the first one, you should know what to expect. If you're new to the series, the next part's for you. And sorry if anything I give it incorrect, I haven't played it since the release, so my memory might be a little cloudy, and things may have been patched.

To start, it's an open world RPG, and you have 4 or 5 characters to choose from (when you're selecting a character, they give a little bit of their own background). Each is unique and have their own survival/combat styles, so there's something for everyone. If you haven't been able to tell, it has a tropical paradise setting. But there's zombies. Everywhere. And lots of weapons to choose from. Like I said before, each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, and parts of their skill tree revolve around those (for example, a character that prefers hand-to-hand will have skills that increase their effectiveness, etc, etc). I can't really go too much into the story without posting spoilers though.

As for the world itself, it's quite large with plenty of different terrains to explore. It's an absolutely beautiful world.

Now on to the rest of the Rigor Mortis edition.

I'll start with hula dancer thing. It's just like any other, if you poke it, it'll bobble around a bit. Nothing too special there. The bottle opener hand is pretty nice. It's real sturdy, has a magnet on it, works just fine. The bungalow key is pretty cool. I wanted to attach it to my keys, but once I received it, I noticed the wooden part is pretty brittle and I would be afraid to break it. It all comes in this suitcase (which is very nice quality). There was also a steelbook case included for the game.

At it's current price, this is an excellent value."
1121,5,"This game is pretty darn easy.  I beat most of the tracks with only a rental.  It's not near as tough as the SNES version.  Heck, the SNES version of Rainbow Road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot.  Rainbow Road is a cakewalk on this one.  Wide the whole way with walls all around.  Too darn easy.  However, there is a monster shortcut that's very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting.

Even though it was too easy, I bought the game anyway.  It's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers.  Plus I really like the game's ending.

There is one hard level, the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode.  It can be very frustrating if you make a mistake, because you get run over again and again and again.  It usually takes away any hope of recovery.

The most significant improvement over the SNES version is the time trial mode.  You can race a ghost of yourself after you've already completed the course.  The ghost is only a recording of your previous performance, but it gives you a lot more motivation to beat your old time, I assure you.

I've never been into multiplayer modes, but if you're into that kind of thing, you'll REALLY love this game.  Some multiplayer matches can go on for a LONG time, since the levels are so well-designed."

53087,5,"I had a really hard time finding this game for my little brother and I. We used to play this all the time a couple years ago so when I found this I was exited to play it for old times. Great game good service, can't ask for much more."
215816,5,"Let's get to the point...The game is awesome! If you liked the older version of this game, then you will love this one.  If you are a little new to the Need for Speed ""world"" and if one of the only NFS titles you ever payed  played was Shift, expect something a little different.  As Game Informer and Gamepro Magazine says, ""this title takes the NFS back to its roots"" and they are not lying.  The previous reviewer, somehow put ""Grand Turismo"" in his review on Hot Pursuit....How can that happen?!  In no way, shape, or form can this game or should this game be compared to Grand Turismo.  This game is as ""arcade"" as you can get, but if you are looking for more of a ""Sim"" racer, look elsewhere.  If you are familiar with the old school version, then you will be familiar with the gameplay of this one.  The graphics are beautiful and the framerate is ""Wipeout"" satisfaction.  You can play as the cop and the street racer in which you can climb the ranks of ""Most wanted"" by the police...or The most badd@$$ cop that no one can outrun.

The controls are spot on and fully custom.  If you don't like the default R1 acceleration...take it old school and accelerate with X.  The sound is really nice as well..if you are familiar with NFS games (starting with underground) then you know you can expect some really nice ""driving music"" to set the tone of the Hot Pursuits.  Also, the game does a nice job of giving you the history, specs, and special qualities of each car with really nice voiceovers..(This can be compared to Grand Turismo, but being that GT is a Sim, GT goes more into depth with this.)

As always, this Need for Speed is fast!! Sometimes too fast!  Remember the shortcuts you could take from the old school version?  Well, they are back..but this time they are really easy to miss because the game is so fast!  So far, I haven't seen any customization options for the cars other than color.  If you are buying this game for the sole purpose of trickin our your rides, then from what I see so far...you may want to look elsewhere.  IMO, you really don't need to do much to the cars anyway.  In other professional reviews (Gameinformer, GamePro, PS magazine ect) you will read that this game is very much compared to Burnout.  I myself never really got into Burnout, but if you are a fan of that series..I am sure you won't be disappointed with this game. One other thing...the game does not offer an Interior Camera View..this was a little upsetting to me, but hey...it wasn't in the old school version and with the absense of this view...IT DOES NOT take away from the excitement of this game.

This review is based on the PS3 version of the game.  I hope this review was helpful."
39273,5,"Everyone who has a PS2 thinks Nightfire is the best. Well, it's not. Not even close compared to RFII. This game has some tough A.I., unlike in Nightfire where when you are sniping them, they just stand there and do that little side step. The Geomod engine is awsome. I love to be able to destroy everything, just like it would be if I really shot a wall with an explosive. The plot and level design is just outstanding(Sci-fi). It takes a little to long to reload. If you die that is probably the reason. I love this game and I think every PS2 owner should have it."
140203,5,This game is one of the most best Wii games I played. I highly recommend Wii sports as one of the best games in the Wii franchise.
264607,5,I needed one because i lost mine...or someone took it. But i got it from thies people and its exactly it...so yeah. If u need a psvita cable this is it!

375597,5,"Im a PS4 guy but wanted something to play with my wife and she is only interested in the nintendo games from our childhood.  While the Wii U lacks a bunch of games, it has some AMAZING one.  Super Mario Bros, Mario Kart, 3d Mario, Smash Bros, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, and down the road Zelda and Star Fox.  What else would anyone need, those games are damn good."

284362,5,their a lot to do in game an their variety of missions the story is well made thu i don't agree with the ending if you tried an like batman AA this is more of the same as it a extension of the story
300040,5,Bought as gift for a young teen.  They thought the game was a good buy!
30444,5,"So we had FFVII,FFVIII, and FVIIII... now for a true final fantasy. FFX really lives up to its name tremendously. Ive heard some pretty good things about the game and a few band things but when i bought it i thought there was nothing bad about it...

You start off as a guy named titus who lives in a city Zanarkand on a island somewhere. You are cherished and are a very famous celebrity on the city's bltizball team. LOL, blitzball is like soccer except you play it in a huge circular water filled dome and you can move freely. Anwyays, soon after hell reaches Zanarkand. A humungous monster named ""Sin"" terrorizes the city and you meet up with a old friend named ""Auron."" Later in the game you meet the Al Bhed (a rebel group of soldiers known to cause destruction) which contain a girl named Rikku who helps you out later in the game. After losing them, you meet a bunch of other people and a girl named Yuna who is what they call a ""summoner"" or a person who protects the land from evil and summons spirits to go into peace or heaven forever. All summoners have guardians that help protect them from evil as well which is what our character Titus will be...

Into the game you find out your father Jecht who treated Titus pretty badly when he was a kid has turned into the Sin monster. LOL i don't want to spoil anything but basically i can say that there are a few key things in the game that come up in the middle...

-yuna and titus fall for each other

-you find out titus isn't even real and he is only a dream as well as zanarkand.

-Jecht and titus fight!!

LOL i probably haven't told you much for a review yet there are too many small details and big key things that you really just have to play the game to see for yourself honestly.. sorry amazon viewers LOL... anyway but i do have pros and cons of the game and trust me it has many great things in store for ya!

PROS: 1. FFX gets you so into the game, it feels like you are really on a adventure

2. there are so many marvelous enviroments throughout the game, there are creepy places and places that make you feel quite relaxed.

3. The characters are very funny and they all have their own kind of sense of humor.

4. The story is so damn good LOL, it feels just like a novel or movie and it will defnitely get you teary eyed... trust me it made be teary lol...

5. The characters too have their own mini stories that tell of their past and why they fight.

6. The cinematics and FMVs are very well done, the lips actually move when they speak and their body and facial expressions are unbelieveable.

7. Titus is a unique character.

8. The bosses and equipment you choose is very well put out and it trains you for what you will face next.

9. The game only costs around 11.99-14.99 in the stores like EB games, gamestop, or maybe even walmart.

10. after beating the game, you will definitely need to buy FFX2 next, definitely!!!

11. the game is quite lengthy and long.

CONS: 1. like up top, the story continues from X to X2, so you need to go out and buy X2 but like i said before it only will cost about 11.99-14.99, so this isn't really a major con at all...

2. Besides the minor con, the only other thing is that many times the bosses will be quite hard, trust me it takes practice and you will probably get very pissed off. LOL don't sweat though, you'll beat it, just keep trying...

Overall, on a 10 scale, this game would be a 100 lol ok ok a 10 but this game was very well done. I think squareenix knew what they were doing when they created this game (im not saying they didn't know what they were doing on the other game lol just that this game is more layed out) and i definitely recommend it to any new FF fan like me or anyone who just started playing RPGs like me again lol... Well this is DJ with another great game review for FINAL FANTASY X...go buy it!"
302441,5,Works great! Can't believe I got such a great product for so cheap. Very high quality. It's just like the Microsoft hard drive but for half the price! Plus supper fast shipping I got it in 3 days! Thank you
57247,5,"This time there is actually a story behind all of this. The problem is that the story is difficult to follow the first time through. After you beat the game once your gonna want to play it agian, and this time your gonna understand the story real well. All those dips*it's that say it was to short HAVE YOU BEATIN THE GAME ON EVERY DIFFICULTY? I don't think so, you would be a freak if you beat it already on every difficulty. I pre-ordered this set because of the case, but the disc is very cool too. Now the gameplay is very cool, and if you want a sweet tip go to [...] and look for my hint it's under mightytoaster91. Overall though Halo 2 is overated, so buy it, but you might just see it as a rehash."
418424,5,"Finally, we in the U.S. get to buy the New Nintendo 3ds.  We had been looking forward, planning on getting this smaller size since it was announce. It came as a huge disappointment when we learned we would not be able to purchase this size after all.  After using them I can happily say we are pleased with the smaller size.  It's convenient for carrying if you have a smaller purse.  I like the lighter feel of it in my hands. The cover plates are definitely fun!
The only down side is for those that weren't interested in purchasing the game, or the cover plates. Having to spend $220.00 is a high price for anyone only interested in the New 3ds. It's really not a big deal for us because we love Animal Crossing so much.
Of course, the new included game can not compare to the original Animal Crossing game, but it's enjoyable for what it is.  We would love to see some of the things from ACHHD included in the next true Animal Crossing game."
8539,5,Fun N64 game that has awesome cheat-codes to boot. A great shooter/collector game
371674,5,"Very very fun game! I haven't had a game get my blood pumping in a long time, and this did it. Fast paced, heavy music, (that i swear gets in some extra bass with every execute) awesome looking and functioning weapons. Bethesda did an awesome job, I liked everything about this game. Many times i would so immersed in a huge fight, jumping constantly while shooting, throwing equips, WHIP around chainsaw a head off, hit a super jump pad while switching and firing rockets down below and through all this i would be silent... until the music stops which signals the end of the fight and that is when the involuntary, ""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo!!!!"" comes out like a warcry!!

You must buy this game. I have not and do not plan on playing multiplayer. Campaign alone is worth it."
459119,5,Kids loved the retro gaming!!! They've been playing for hours.

241280,5,"Exelent product it is just what I expected and more. I like everything about it, it works perfect for me."
386477,5,I've been waiting for this game a long time now and it didn't disappoint just waiting on the remaining updates
116745,5,"It's been awhile since I thoroughly enjoyed a game as much as Uncharted. There are only a handful of games where you just have to make the time to play until the end, and this was definitely one of those. It's reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 in the way that gameplay has been designed. I especially appreciate all the creative thought and programming that went into designing the breath-taking scenery. An excellent game!"
59435,5,"Think about this for a minute.

In the Sims 2 (which is going to be released on the same day as this consiquently) You have a character who has aspirations, dreams, hopes, can pass their DNA down through the line, and the Sims franchise will basically live your lives for you because you weigh 30 pounds over the ""projected perfection"" and you're too afraid to go out and live life.

In other words, the Sims 2 will be the ultimate chick game and the ultimate waste of time.

Now FABLE comes along and offers close to the same thing, only more.  More = violence.  Forgive me for sounding chovanist, but the idea of marrying a young lass struck with amazement at your status in the game, knocking her up, and fighting for good and evil, does comprise MORE than a game based coded personalities (no matter how many algoritims there are that make up these personalities) which after a while, I assure you will be tapped out.

So, if you want to go and live life through your computer and marry Prince Charming or that raven haired woman you can't approach at work, go ahead and waste your money on the Sims.  But if you want a life experience in which you have a dramatic role in fighting off evil (or slaughtering innocence) in the world around you, while still engaging in day to day activities. Pick this up."

210493,5,"Buy it, I think I've seem movies with less convincing plots than this game, I think is because is base on an actual novel "" Heart of Darkness"" (yes, I did look that up) but never the less Spec Ops: the Line is a great game with a very unsuspected ending and I recommend you buy it."
357815,5,Grandsons Love there new game
435237,5,Great price ship fast
271596,5,I love it!
117625,5,Awesome 2 player game - probably one of the better wrestling games that I've ever played. Best for two players as it's loads of fun to play with another person or for simulating matches (which is incredibly boring and I don't do that)
79942,5,"Works well, and quality is well above the 360's standard headset. Comfortable, good fitting, and the mic has a long reach and doesn't feel like it's ever in the way. This last part is especially useful as I I have a fairly large, potato-like head, and always found the 360's default set uncomfortable, in the way and just a general pain."
145853,5,I couldn't help but write another review...simply because of some false information some reviewers are saying...All the ps3 systems run very quiet you will have to listen really close to hear the 20 40 and 60 gig...i have a 20 gig that i purchased on launch and i have a 40 gig that i purchased a few months ago for my spare room....NO difference...Any of the Ps3 systems are a great purchase!! With all the A titles coming out your money is well spent...call of duty 4 rachet and clank are amazing...also haze blacksite and then next year killzone 4 mgs...the list of top titles are coming quick...
486032,5,wife loved it
129258,5,"Exactly as advertised.  Great price. Fast shipping. Worked perfectly.  For once, the youngest child got to hand something down to his older brother."
66764,5,"The first thing that I realized with this game is that it has a certain calmness to it. Your character is able to ride a horse across open plains, through dark forests, and lands that are simply amazing and brilliant. This makes the game very relaxing as you are able to admire the breathtaking scenery along your path.  The visual effects for this only being a PS2 game are phenomenal.

The environment that the game designers have created is simply amazing. Virtually every place that you see you can go and this makes the game a lot of fun. I found myself wasting more time just riding the horse around rather than seeking the path towards these unearthly creatures. The game also has extras that provide more replay value as well. All in all this game is different in a great way and what I consider to be a landmark. I have played many games and this one is unique and definitely a keeper.

I would recommend this game to everyone!"
355294,5,This game is stunning and a great remake of my personal favorite generation. Emerald was my first pokemon game ever that I alone owned and didn't have to share with my older brothers and I played it probably 1000 times through. This remake makes playing the game fun all over again. A little bit dissapointed they removed the charachter customization that was in XY but it's not needed. My dad also got Ruby version of this game and after exclusively playing pokemon yellow on an old game boy he really loves the new style of gameplay and the animations.
184702,5,"The graphics are amazing!!! Thats really the reason why i got this game. The game play is fun, its easy to use and figure it out. But to be honest its just too big. And its a lot of horseriding. Picture GTA4, the whole map layout in its huge entirety, and now take everything out of it, except a few cactuses and a coyote or 2. It takes forever in between missions, just getting from one place to the next. I played this hard for like 2 weeks or so and haven't played it since. Its definately worth the money just to see what rockstar can do though. Just don't plan on playing it all that long. Maybe a renter first to see if you like it. Would recommend."
288120,5,Really fun to play!
223971,5,"I bought the extra controller cause i thought something was wrong with my other controller which later i found out it was the game i was playing so the first controller was fine,anyway i don't play the games included but could always find someone who likes them. Great value"
370825,5,"Excellent Campaign, Excellent Multiplayer, Excellent Graphics, Excellent Gameplay, and Excellent Music...Arguably one of the best games I have ever played."
34544,5,The Best RPG ever made. They just don't make games like this anymore. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
423905,5,Son Loved it
11710,5,The second Spyro is even better than the first one. You get more power to make this action game that much more fun. It is great for kids or adults.
362299,5,I love it
402359,5,for my son good price
20235,5,"HERE ARE 3 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME:
1: This game got my dad hooked on it. We play it together all the time.
2:This game got me into loving luxery and sports cars.
3: The gameplay graphics are amazing. The replay movies are just like the real thing."
64699,5,"To begin, I should say that watching the movie before you play the game will make it much more fun.  Unlike most games based off of movies, this game is a prequel to the movie.  It takes place three months before the beginning of the movie and you learn how the Warriors began and see the characters from the movie evolve.  It's an ingenius idea and the game is terrific.

The graphics are great, the sound is great, the plot of each mission is great.  It has the feel from the movie, too.  The music comes straight from the movie score and dark feel, the movie carried, continues in this game.  Playing, you get an opportunity to look into the background of the Warriors and the other gangs introduced in the movie.  It's outstanding.

In all honesty, I have so much good to say about this game, I'm having trouble keeping my thoughts in order.  All I can say is play it, and if you haven't seen the movie, rent the movie then play the game.  I'm telling you, you won't be dissapointed."
216965,5,"Received this with the new Xbox that I bought.  I hooked it up to the old hard drive and then connect it to to the USB port on the xbox.  Xbox recognizes the connection right away and after a few clicks, all my game saves, DLCs, profiles are downloaded.  Depends on the size of your old hard drive, download progress may take a while.  I waited about 6 minutes to complete a download of 10 GB."
146964,5,"I generally do not like expansions. They used to be additions only very successful games got to have. Nowadays they are mostly the...other half of the game the publisher withheld when selling us half the original for $50! C&C:KANE's WRATH is a rare exception that brings new dimensions to an already great game!

Story-wise, although an expansion, this is somewhat of a prequel to C&C3-TIBERIUM WARS, as it is set on the history of NOD, starting off just after the 2nd Tiberium War and continuing well past the 3rd.
There is a big campaign comprising of 13 single player missions, new units and upgrades and a new (a la RISE OF NATIONS) Global Conquest mode, that can turn C&C3 into a Turn-Based game! What make this REALLY interesting are the six subfactions, each with its special units, strengths and weaknesses. Not to worry, all GDI, NOD and Scrin get their own off-shooting factions.
On the opposite ends of the spectrum, there is Reaper-17 (a Scrin sub-faction): with hard-hitting and powerful offensive options; and then there is Traveler-59 (also a Scrin offshoot): a much more devious faction that relies on mind control of humans (remember how much fun Yuri's Revenge? was). In between, GDI's (retro) Steel Talons and (futuristic) ZoCom and NOD's (mind-benders) Black Hand and (cyborgs galore) Mark of Kane.

Production of the new epic-units can tip the battlefield scales dramatically. Most are not only devastating but are pretty hard to take down too. GDI gets the MARV [Mammoth Armed Reclamation Vehicle], a souped-up triple-barreled tank; NOD gets the Redeemer, an augmented killer avatar; whereas, Scrin get the Eradicator Hexapod, a impressive six-legged mech.
Revamped units, such as the Shard Walker or the Reaper Tripod, or back-to-the-drawing-board units, such as the Prodigy or the Ravager all add to a renewed experience. Moreover, as a long-time C&C fan, I particularly enjoyed the reappearance of good-ol' units such as Titans and Wolverines on the side of GDI!

The graphics are beautiful, the physics detailed and the explosions and beam-weapons spectacular! Don't forget to turn on the volume on those speakers, because this is a total immersion experience.

As with the original: it misses the 5th star for fun because one cannot hold a battle formation while moving. As most units move at different paces (and although the AI has improved they keep bumping on each other), this results in the more agile, yet vulnerable, units having to face the enemy first - a short-lived sight... May be the next C&C (say, RED ALERT 3) could have some TOTAL WAR infused into it, with battle formations options.

If you are boycotting SecuROM you should know that it is the copy-protection used (nevertheless, it is the usual version used in the original C&C3-TW as well, coming nowhere near the BIOSHOCK RootKit madness!). I usually withhold at least one rating star because of such security inconveniences. However, I enjoyed the game so much that I was willing to overlook it. On the other hand, since it is important for a great number of Amazon customers, I have to mention it for the sake of a well informed decision.

Finally, be advised that this is an expansion and, yes, you do need the original C&C3: TIBERIUM WARS to play it. If you do not have it, take note that there is a pack available, including both original game and expansion (the prices fluctuate so make sure to get the best deal).

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
316090,5,"I downloaded this from Nintendo's eShop.  I love the game as much as Melee. There's more characters, much options, awesome graphics, and support for eight players. It's a bit more balanced than Brawl and I think its better than brawl."

184813,5,"This review is MY opinion! If you have played the game and don't agree with me, that is fine - Just don't tell me I'm wrong, because this is MY opinion! However, I wouldn't mind hearing your thoughts and knowing if you do agree or not.

I rate RED DEAD REDEMPTION, 5 out of 5 stars -

Intro: I want to start by saying this game is AMAZING!! I first purchased it because my cousin said it was a lot of fun, but only knew it was a western themed action game. Upon receiving it, I haven't been able to put the controller down. My wife and I find ourselves playing it nightly after work and have a hard time turning it off to go to bed. With that said, here is a detailed review...

Story: Going into Red Dead I didn't know what to expect. I think this made me enjoy it more and now that I have few a few dozen hours into it, I find the story fantastic. The game starts off reasonable slow, but I wouldn't consider this a negative, because it teaches you how to use your character to his full potential. You start out doing basic missions that involve herding cattle and breaking horses. This really gives you the feeling of the cowboy lifestyle. You eventually build up to doing more difficult missions, much in vein of the Grand Theft Auto style. One thing I really like about Rockstar as game developer is their ability to create very interesting characters - One in the game is named Irish, who is a stereotypical drunk and another is Seth who enjoys digging up graves and searching for treasure. There are many more rememberable characters, but I'll leave them up to you to meet. I can't go into much more detail about what makes the story so brilliant without spoiling it, so I suggest buying it and finding out for yourself! Just take my word for it - It's outstanding.

Gameplay: The majority of the gameplay is going around to different places, saving people and shooting bad guys and animals. There are tons of missions and even though some are repetitive, they are extremely fun! The controls are pretty solid, however sometimes it gets frustrating when you are trying to reach an area and your character moves too fast and won't go exactly where you want him too.

Graphics: Pretty decent overall and for a sand box (open world) game, this one looks really good. The scenery is absolutely amazing! You can watch the sun set and rise in real time.

Sound: Sounds pretty damn good. There are a couple really good songs used at just the right moment. There are also tons of great sound effects that work brilliantly if you have a 5.1 system. From humans screaming, to animals growling... It sounds great!

Replay Value: Replay the game again ""once"" I complete it? I`m really not sure. If you play through the whole game and complete all the side missions, you're looking at, at least 100+ hours of play time. I will at least be replaying some missions, because some are just brilliant (it's great the game gives you the ability to replay any mission you've already completed).

Rent Or Buy This Game? BUY IT!!!

My Personal Verdict & Your Final Score: I really love all the attention to detail Rockstar put into this game. From all the character dialogue, the loads of AI having funny conversations with each other, the amusing replies you get when you tip your hat to a whore, to the scenery. This game just does everything right and by the end I'm sure John Marston will be one of my new favorite video game characters. It is by far the best wild west games I've heard of and seen. It's like the game developers took the coolest stuff about western movies and put it all in the game. The game gets an easy 10."

25777,5,"The best Fifa game for me was FiFa 98 for one simple reason, the camera views were the best. You could see the field and how your players were distributed and create passing arrangements that would boggle the mind. I know this game had its flaws but it still was superior than the others. The scenic movies they provided for each host country was phenomenal. I sure hope EA gets it right this time out. Fifa 2001 was fun but annoying, specially with those bicycle kicks, sure they were spectacular to watch but not if you saw them about 36 times in just one game. But if they really want to make this game worthy, they should fix the camera views. You can never see who you are passing the ball ahead of you. Sure there are other camera angles, but they are terribly akward. Another terrible feature of 2001 was the shooting bar. You can't strike the ball with enough force outside the area, the goals become monotonous and just have to be the same in order to score. You also need to add more leagues from the American Continent. Just Brazil and US doesn't cut it, what about the Argetinian league? Or even the Mexican. Just paying some rights would acquire you an extremely loyal market. This is 2002 the year of the world cup, you definetly need to add much more international teams than you had on 2001, atleast every team in the American Continent. One more thing, and I hope your reading this EA for your sake! Fact, if you want to sell the most copies of a game ever for this console, you have to add spanish commentary to the game. Its getting boring listening to the same decrepid irish or scottish announcers you had in this game for over 4 years. The best commentary in spanish at the time is by Omar Tapia and company from ESPN International. This truely would make the game a winner and a worldwide success."

141338,5,"I'm 5'10, 194 lbs.  Obviously I'm overweight, according to Wii Fit, my BMI is 28 which is far to high.  Normal is 22.  All this info I had no idea of even after going to do a yearly health checkout for abour $500, so right there, the Wii Fit is a good investment.

Now, let's get to the fun part.  The actual exercises.  The aerobics & balance games really does not feel like tedious work / exercise.  Very fun & enjoyable.  The yoga & strength training does feel like exercise, but it's in small bursts and overall just feels more fun because you interact with the balance board and get some stats on how well you are doing.  Even gonig to a gym and hiring an instructor cannot get you such detailed stats.

For anyone looking to loose weight, this is a great pickup.  The only other game that's similar to this is the eye toy exercise game on PS2, the balance board is much more precise.  In the future, I can foresee a combination of board & remote working in conjunction to let us play 3D games.

With a bunch of unlockables, it gives you incentive to exercise and workout.  If Wii offers some downloadable content as more unlockables, that would keep the Wii population fit!"

246596,5,"I love everything about this pad. The shape makes it possible to use a variety of different grips, the switches are very responsive (personally I'd prefer a bit more force required but this is more accurate to traditional arcade buttons), and it can be used with a USB port or PS/2.
Some people complain that the parts wear out easily, but at this price that should be expected. Either buy another one or get a real fightstick with real arcade parts.
Note: some Windows PCs, for whatever reason, don't have the necessary drivers for Xbox controllers. If you have this issue, the pad is not defective; you simply need to manually install the drivers. There are plenty of tutorials for this."
58144,5,"thug 2 is sweet. its called the world distruction tour but there isn't that much distruction. all the create modes are back including create a graphic. you make a graphic and then use it to tag walls. for what is of the distrution you get to skate in more places. what sucks in the story mode is that you cant choose what team you're gonna be on. first you go to Tony, then Bam, and back to Tony. remember in the first thug game when eric was there well hes on Bams team. instead of cars they have scooters and go karts. in this game you're not just you. you can be up to 4 people. the pro, guest, secret man, and you. comparing to the last game this game is short unless you're on sick. it don't matter what system you have just buy it."

76030,5,"Final Fantasy IV (originally ""II"" in America on the SNES) was probably the first time Square did an RPG that resembles the kind they do now. With a more ambitious story - well, at the time, anyway - and a whole host of characters, IV is often considered a classic by many RPGers. While I will admit this is way better than what most companies can do, there was something missing that set it apart from ones like VI or VII. Maybe it's too dated or maybe it just wasn't as compelling or better structured and while I did like IV, I didn't necessarily love it either.

Story: You play as Cecil, captain of the Red Wings, Baron's elite fighting force. Coming home from a mission which had questionable outcomes, Cecil disapproves and the King, infuriated, sends him on another mission to deliver a package to a nearby town. But when the package proves destructive, Cecil and a group of friends he meets along the way, have to somehow stop the King from what he's planning and figure out the mastermind behind it all.

Graphics: Since this is more improved graphics of a SNES release, you'll notice things look more sharper and cleaner than before but there are by no means wow-inducing. But having Amano artwork for character portraits is a nice touch and the game runs quite smoothly. But the environments are just as diverse and although not immaculately detailed, they're fine within the context of the game.

Sound/Music: Many would also consider IV's soundtrack to be the first classic soundtrack with Nobuo Uematsu at the top of his form. Personally, while the themes are lively and one track in particular (""Rydia"") has a gorgeous melody, I can't really remember some of them. I could hum practically 3/4's of VI or VII's soundtrack yet if you would tell me what does the town theme sound like, I'd be hardpressed to even get it right. Just saying, it's a good soundtrack to have on but this was just the beginning, as they say.

Gameplay: IV was another instance where characters had specific classes whereas previous games either had the Job system or user-determined classes. From mainstays like dragoons to thieves to bards to white and black mages, all the familiars are here. Some aren't as useful as others but they're all memorable and despite one character you get super late into the game, they all have distinct personalities.

The Chronicles port was the Hardtype version which practically required characters to level up should they want to have a more comfortable playing and not get slaughtered. This port some would describe as easy and while there wasn't a lot of instances where it got frustrating, save some cheap shots, this isn't a game where it feels like a struggle just to get through. My one complaint is that sometimes enemies don't give as much EXP as they should and with 5 members of your team on hand, it makes levelling up a chore when you have to get into near 10-15 battles just for one guy to progress a level.

Part of what made me want to play and finish IV was that it was the only one out of the IV-XII series that I haven't beat. So while the game does have some memorable moments, themes and solid gameplay, this didn't hit me as hard as subsequent games."
326727,5,Perfect! Much better than buying a 3DS for so much more.
157441,5,The best system I purchased I still have it and works perfect.
222669,5,I bought my Wii from a friend.  It had the original remote without the motion sensor.  The Remote Plus works much better with my fitness games.

Since i got the PSX verision i instantly fell in love with this genre. some people are like ""a farming game?"" with blank faces...but this game is awesome. im already in winter and this game is great. its similar to the PSX version with LOADS of extras. instead of 5 girls to marry theres 6 but i won't spoil it. the gameplay is non-linear with every hour like 5 or so seconds but you can get alot done in a day. ive been playing since i got the game and its addicting...too bad they don't allow GBA in school because i would be playing it in school all day...well i can say that MY CHICKEN IS SUMO WRESTLING CHAMPION!!! good game i give it a 9.9 out of 10 because winter is pretty boring. but great game worth the money and the link ability to gc will be great and ill review harvest moon AWL after i get mine. later"

337029,5,I always love playing a mahjong game. Keeps my mind sharp.  I found myself playing for hours on end! O am retired so I find it very entertaining.
85965,5,"It's a real shame they don't make this gamepad anymore--I dread the day mine dies. It is an absolutely fantastic little device. The software hasn't been updated in awhile but it's still fully functional on Win7 64bit with modern kit.

I use it for ALL games that I don't play with a controller. It's superior to keyboard controls in every single way. The included software (downloadable free from their website) allows you to configure every single key on the device. And it's not required to support ""your game"", it will work with any game. It comes with profiles for several older games, but creating a new profile is very simple. The only thing you have to watch out for is the automatic EXE detection, where it will try to switch the layout depending on what game you're in. I've found this to be problematic so I always clear those values, which causes it to be active all the time. The theory is that you can set game EXE's with each profile, so every time you load a game it automatically switches the profile. But more frequently what happens is it doesn't load any profile because the exe name is wrong or has changed. Right-clicking on the icon in the tray allows me to switch from the last 5 profiles I've used, which makes the auto-detection a non-issue.

An example of how great this device is is World of Warcraft. Any serious player will want as many of their abilities hot-keyed as possible. It's difficult when playing on the keyboard to reach the 6 key and beyond while still on the WASD movement keys. Granted, it's also hard to do this on the FANG because the top row is too far up. However, on the FANG, you can remap the 7 and beyond to the buttons on the right side of the pad and extending down. This makes all those ""extended"" buttons accessible to your right index finger, which is quick and accurate.

Additionally, I chose to bind the 3 large bottom buttons on the left side as shift, alt, and control, so all three modifiers are always quickly accessible via pinky. This makes for huge amounts of keys (36, more if using dual-modifiers) to be used without lifting your left hand and maintaining movement control on WASD.

The only thing I don't like is that the ""space"" key on the sides is a mouse-click mechanical button rather than a soft key, and it feels cheap. That's the only button I don't like, but it hasn't worn out yet! (It's not a mouse-click action and can be mapped to any key, it's just the same mechanical device they use in mice and has the same ""click"" sound.)

In the 2 to 3 years I've owned this device, it has withstood lots and lots of gameplay and many static-electric shocks that my keyboards and mice have not. Its durability is shockingly high."
193482,5,"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is, without a doubt, one of the best games I have ever played.  It is almost 3 years old now as it was one of the near-launch titles for the Wii, but it is still one of the prettiest titles available in the entire catalog of Wii games.  So, if you have never owned/played Metroid Prime 3, then this purchase is a no-brainer: In addition to Metroid Prime 3, one of the best titles available on the Wii... you get it's pre-Wii predessors: Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2, both of which, despite being ports of Gamecube game, still look incredible, and have the added benefit of the new Wii controls.

For the price of one Wii game, you get 3 of the best games available on Gamecube/Wii.  It is estimated by Ign.com that the entire trilogy amounts to over 80 hours of gameplay... and this doesnt even take into account the fact that Metroid Prime 2 also has 4-player splitscreen multiplayer (LOCAL ONLY unfortunately!).  Also, for those of you that are like me and like a real challenge, once you beat the game on ""Veteran"" difficulty, you unlock ""Hypermode"" difficulty.  I never did beat Metroid Prime 3 on Hypermode difficulty... it is that hardcore.

Here are some features that make this trilogy an epic must-have for the Wii:

1) 3 GREAT games for the price of 1... no brainer.  All 3 games look great and are a blast to play.  When you start up Trilogy, you can select to play any of the 3 games, or to play Prime 2's multiplayer (which is available from the start).  Each game has it's own progress tracking/save, as well as achievements.

2) Improved controls, visuals, and gameplay for Metroid Prime 1 and 2: The visuals on both games got a bit of an update, and some of the bosses and enemies are more balanced.  Basically, MP 1 and 2 play almost exactly like Metroid Prime 3.

3) Achievements: Each game includes a pretty robust set of unlockable achievements (a new addition to MP 1 and 2).  When I originally played MP 3, this was one of my favorite features (maybe I am borderline OCD?)... I really enjoyed scanning each and every enemy and item, gaining various trophies, etc.  This feature is a welcome addition to the first 2 games.

4) Metroid Prime 2 multiplayer - This was a welcome addition to Metroid Prime 2, and I am glad they preserved it in the Trilogy collection.  It is fairly basic, but an absolute blast.  I really enjoy local multiplayer personally... I prefer it to online only games because frequently with Wii games, you can either play online, or you can play with your friends locally... almost never both for some reason.  I love having friends over for a good old fashioned frag-fest... and this game will deliver.  It's just a shame they didn't add an online multiplayer component.  This was a real missed opportunity... but not a deal breaker.  4-player splitscreen versus mode is a welcome addition, and works very nicely.  Granted... it's no Call of Duty.... but it is a blast to play through.  Me and my friends will have a blast with this, especially since The Conduit only has online multiplayer (what a shame!)... part of the draw of owning a Wii is having your friends over to play local multiplayer games.

5) Hardcore Difficulty: ""Hypermode Difficulty"" mode is a BEAST.  It will make you want to pull your hair out. It is not for the faint of heart! =)  I loved every second of it... Metroid Prime 3's Hypermode Difficulty was REALLY punishing... enemies are hard to kill and plentiful.  I LOVE a challenge, and hate when games end too early or are too easy... and these games do neither.  Over 80hrs of hardcore gameplay? Yes please...

In short, this Trilogy belongs in EVERY Wii-owner's collection.  Not to mention it comes in a ""Collector's Edition"" tin case with a poster and cool concept art... I even got a free MP Trilogy T-shirt.  GO BUY THIS GAME!  NOW.. seriously... I'll wait.. GO!

Here are my rating scores for the Trilogy (all 3 games as 1):

Presentation: 9/10 (menus are updated with pointer functionality, and you can select your game (MP1,2,3 or multiplayer) from the start screen. My only gripe is that your gamesaves from the original Metroid Prime 3: Corruption CANNOT be used for this game... so I have to start from scratch.  No worries, though... I played through that game 2 years ago, so I am about due for a replay.

Graphics: 10/10 - this is one of the pretties games on the Wii. Enemies and environments are colorful and lively.

Gameplay: 10/10 - These are 3 of the best games available on ANY Nintendo console.  'Nuff said.

Lasting Appeal: 9/10 - 3 hardcore games with unlockable ""Hypermode"" difficulty, plus robust achievements.  Local only multiplayer. I would rate it 10/10 if they had included online multiplayer... but I prefer local-only multiplayer to online-only multiplayer.

Overall: 9.5/10 - Absolutely incredible set of games. A must-have for all Wii owners!"
297891,5,"First off I wanted to say that the limited edition of this product is a great deal and that more games should have limited editions that come this way. I would highly recommend this game to anybody who is a hardcore JRPG/RPG gamer. Its very challenging on both difficulty levels and won't hold your hand. I'm going to give you a few reason why I believe this games deserves a 5 star rating. The gameplay, The gameplay is immersive! grinding and fusing different types of demons together to make new ones is a site to be seen. the interaction with the demons in the dungeon is funny and rewarding. you can take their money away from them witch in the game is called ""mecca"" or talk to them to have them become apart of your party. In game battles are challenging you have to make sure your on your A game cause the foes won't go easy on you. you wear a gauntlet on your arm that can speak to you its called ""Burroughs"" its a spirit that speaks to you and that will help you along your mission by telling you quest missions your side missions and everything to navigate through the game successfully. in your menu you have ""Apps"" yes apps you can buy and download apps to your gauntlet and use them for battle upgrades (gaining more mecca from demons / being able to see the enemies weakness/or being able to better negotiate with them so they can join your party/ etc ) as you can see the game offers a very deep combat system (when in battle its all in first person no seeing your party members on screen like in FF or chrono trigger its still great but something you have to get use to) . you also have side quest you can do that will appear in K's tavern on whats called the ""Black board"" you can use your Burroughs to access these side quest witch adds more replay value to the game. off of the main quest some mission will have you get different types of items and bring them back and you'll get a weapon or armor upgrade etc. navigating through the kingdom of mikado will be done so by menus Vs walking around. This game has many levels and endless amount of content to offer with being able to fuse the demons you get plus with the different dudgeons and the story line your easily looking at a 60+ hour gaming experience. if you like persona 4 then you should feel right at home here. the only negative things i can say that really don't take away from the game for me is that in the dungeon you won't have a way point or map that tells you where everything is (the legends of zelda/ dark cloud) you'll get a map but it won't tell you where special items are (could change later in the game as of this review its not nothing like that so far)  witch some might not like but for me its fine cause I want a challenge and not a easy JRPG/RPG. Overall I really love this game and know I'm going to have a blast as I keep playing it from the dialogue, the demon fusing, and atmosphere I have no complaints. do yourself a favor and don't think twice about purchasing this outstanding game. Enjoy!!"

55118,5,"I have never played any of Koei's other games, so I have no idea how this one compares with Dynasty Warriors.

Personally, I like this game quite a bit. The controls aren't complicated, the hack-and-slash aspect is awesome for those of us who are of a ""killing first, mission second"" gaming mindset (like me), and gameplay is not impossible, but also not painfully easy. There's a wide variety of characters (once you unlock them), and the graphics are very lovely.

I think some of the character designs could use a little work (like Kuniochi in her sports bra and cargo shorts, or Oichi in her cutesy jailbait anime girl get-up), but all in all, I think the pros outweigh the cons."
35658,5,"The East Coast is just starting to recover from a horrific sniper situation in Maryland, and I go home everynight and play a video game that offers nothing but killing and in many instances sniping. What can I say? I have a stressful job and in some of the levels of Hitman, you are in a snowy solitary area where the optimum method of completing the level is sniping the targets. No time limits, just targets that are a long ways away and you can ""take them out"" without ramifications. I find this relaxing. sorry. Other levels are just shoot em ups and that's fun too. Since there are alternative methods of completing a mission, one tends to go back to a level and try it a different way. I love this game, but it is probably not for the politically correct."

168858,5,"Not since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-4/dp/B000B69E9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;have I gotten so intensely immersed in a game. What a cool game Bioshock is. Let me say up front that I haven't finished it, and I don't want to be finished. I have played for at least 15 hours and I don't get the impression that I'm even close to finishing.

I'm sure that I could have gotten a lot farther in the game than I am a lot faster, but you can prolong the game by exploring areas that may not be the most direct route to your goal. And I spend a lot of time exploring. These little explorations are usually fruitful, because hidden throughout the expansive game are all kinds of weapons, perks and information about where you've suddenly found yourself captive: In the underwater city of Rapture.

The game begins with you as the sole survivor of a mid-sea plane crash. You swim to what appears as a lighthouse, but is also the entrance to Andrew Ryan's underwater utopian city of Rapture. Did I say utopian? Well, that may have been the original idea, but the Rapture you ultimately find yourself in is the antithesis of a utopia. I believe the term is dystopia.

You soon start receiving radio transmissions from Ryan, a guy named Atlas and a doctor named Tennenbaum with advice on how to proceed in the game. Unfortunately, the advice you get often conflicts. Atlas and Ryan are clearly at war. And I'm not far enough in the game to even know for sure whose side Tennenbaum is on...but I've got a good feeling about her is all I'll say.

You are given goals and roadblocks o'plenty to prevent you from easily reaching your goals. The few people (called Splicers) left in Rapture that you run into have all gone stark raving mad, and they'll ruin your day if you let them get too close. And don't trip a security alarm; it'll summon armed drones and more Splicers.

Oh yeah, that Big Daddy guy in the old fashioned divers suit on the cover of the game case...they're roaming all over Rapture. Big, slow, doofy things, right? Mmmm hmmm...word to the wise: Don't get it mad. Sometimes the Big Daddies have Little Sisters in tow that seem to be inspecting corpses (um, yeah, corpses) strewn around either because you did some damage or...something else did. Mess with a Little Sister?...Over a Big Daddy's dead body! Atlas says kill `em; Tennenbaum says save `em...what to do...what to do?

You get all kinds of weapons and opportunities to upgrade your weapons. R1 switches through the weapons and R2 fires. A pistol. A Shotgun. A chemical thrower. A grenade launcher. You're well equipped. (I'm at the part where you're given the crossbow.) You even get a camera to take pictures that allow you to conduct research on your foes to increase the damage you can inflict on them and lessen the damage that they inflict on you (don't worry...all you have to do is take the dang picture; the research is done automatically).

In addition to the corpses strewn throughout the game, so is ammo, money and other knick-knacks that will help you progress through the game. Just be sure to search everything if you want to maximize your strength.

And speaking of maximizing your strength, one of the first things you get is Plasmids...or put another way...special abilities. Telekinesis. Pyrokinesis. And a bunch of other Plasmid ""kinesises"" are unlocked pending your ability to find them. Try picking something heavy up with your telekinesis and throwing it at your enemy...better yet, plant a few proximity mines on that thing before you toss it! Switch through your Plasmids with L1 and use `em with L2.

You're also granted ""tonics"" to customize your character with. Stuff like armor, various strengths, first aid boosts, and secondary damage your enemies from your weapons or from just plain old being attacked. Really cool stuff.

Like the Ganados in Resident Evil 4, the Splicers in Bioshock become quite annoying and redundant, but I suppose that's the idea. Your goals change all the time. Just when you think you've attained a critical goal...it backfires or you're immediately given another that requires backtracking...and then backtracking again. But rest assured it never gets boring. The eerie atmospheres and creepy environments that Bioshock's creators have put together are more than effective. Some areas are really creepy, and there's nothing worse than not being able to find your way out of those which isn't always easy. But that's the fun!

The game lets you save at any time, and when you restart play it starts you at the exact place you last saved...not at the last checkpoint. Pretty cool.

If you liked RE4 or those kinds of survival / horror games...Bioshock is for you. Add this to your cart. And watch for Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams next year sometime.

(P.S.--I know that video game to big screen conversions mostly seem to fail, but I've got high hopes for the 2010 movie adaptation of Bioshock with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-Trilogy-s/dp/B001BKZD7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy's</a>&nbsp;Director Gore Verbinski at the helm.

50425,5,"There are rare occasions where a game closely follows the film and expands. With 'Enter the Matrix' we went behind the films which was cool, but nevertheless, there were scenes and characters we died to try. In the original 'Spider-man' game, we were close as well, with missions much like the film, but they almost went astray...they also teased you. Opening up an entire city for you, just to wander in certain areas... Why? Why? Why?
The answer is, 'Spider-man 2.'
This game is easily one of the better games to have come out this year, the past few years, for a film, and for awhile. I love it. You can go anywhere, do anything, and still feel like it's a Spider-man game. Honestly, I'm disappointed in the reviews here on Amazon.com because frankly, this game is exceptional.
The graphics aren't top notch, but they're still amazing. I mean, the transitions for day and night are flawless and the building outlines are a modern comic...it's nice. The physics and movement so hit the nail on the head, you just become so addicted. The ads say, 'TAKE NEW YORK FOR A SPIN.' Let's just say I wouldn't sue them for false advertising. New York is easily seen and the graphics are prime to bring this to life. I must admit some characters could have been better, but the CGI cut scenes are some of the best work, to date.
Controls. You feel them very fast. A reent review compared the swinging system for beginners, to the way Peter Parker first learned his moves...they're not far off. You start off and you really are amazed at what you can do and how you can pull it off. The swinging system is so profound, original, and realistic...it's almost worth the game. The physics system really propels you as well, making you go faster, climbs walls with ease, and even run up them! Needless to say, there's nothing to complain about here, and if you do...try Easy Swinging.
Story and Characters are all there. I hate Mysterio, always have. The levels he's in are indeed lame and annoying, but once past they're fine. The levels with Shocker and Black Cat are so much fun and you really capture the spirit and free will of Spiderman. Not to mention, Black Cat is very well acted with a great story and dialogue written in that fits well with the film's story. MJ is fine, although a bit under the weather as far as graphics at times. Doc Ock is a blast, although there should have been more levels and a bit more challenging if you ask me. Either way, everything is great and the storyline is woven perfectly.
The game takes you anywhere, from Greenwich to Gramercy, they even have a WTC memorial at night in the Financial District. Along with notable places like NY Public Library or Statue of Liberty, there are film locales too such as Oscorp, Osborne Mansion, Parker's apartment, MJ's, etc. Even the campus! From delivering pizzas to making MJ's play, you really do feel the stressful life of Spider-man as random crimes or people call to your help. The game is overwhelming and I found this far more interesting than the repetitive Grand Theft Auto series, only because, when in GTA can you swing to high buildings or traverse NYC on a train or car?
Either way, this is a great game and will leave you challenged and having fun for hours, days, and nights. I recommend it, not only to Spider-man fans, but to anyone that wants a good game."

30550,5,"It is unfortunate that the word ""video game"" applies to this fantastic work of art. If not for the actual game action in this title, it would certainly pass for a great movie.
First of all, the story is superb. The character development is very deep and detailed. You get to know each character as the story unfolds. Their motivations and history are revealed. Each character harbors some sadness and tragedy, but this aspect alone draws you closer to the characters. As in the other FF titles, there are monsters galore to fight and puzzles to solve. There are a great deal of movie sequences in FFX, so sometimes the action is put on hold in lieu of the story line...which is really a great idea. There is a very good balance of action and movie scenes in FFX.
Each time you battle or find treasure, you are sometimes rewarded with magical spheres. After accumulating a certain amount and type, you will be able to upgrade your characters through upgrade grid screen. The system is a little confusing at first glance, but it is learnable within a few rounds of battle.
There are a lot of very inpressive looking games out in the world, but many of them lack depth or game play value. FFX is a total package...stupendious graphics, innovative game play, terrific story line and terrific movie scenes. It is too bad that video games cannot get Oscars as Final Fantasy X would have definitely taken away a few of the awards. For the RPG'er, the state of the art game has manifested itself and has become the standard for all others in Final Fantasy X. Kudos to the SquareSoft team for making such an enjoyable masterpiece. Of all the titles that I have played, I believe FFX to be my favorite.
""Video Game"" is much too mundane a term for FFX.:)"
257760,5,This is one of the best games ever. Fully Destructible environment and the detail in the maps is unbelievable.  If you plan to buy modern warfare 3 STOP  buy this instead better game all around.
71369,5,"I have been a fan of the Mario Kart series since Mario Kart 64, and I must say Mario Kart DS does not disappoint! Mario Kart DS returns to the formula that made Mario Kart 64 and all other incarnations of the Mario Kart series so enjoyable while adding innovations of its own. Here are some pros of the game:

Pros -

+ Various Course Levels (32 in all) - Mario Kart DS reprises some levels from the previous Mario Kart installations, including favorites such as Frappe Snowland from MK64 and the famous Rainbow Road. There are also innovative new levels ranging from a airship fortress, a desert level (complete with the angry sun from Super Mario 3), and a haunted mansion. There are also various obstacles, such as piranha flowers, that try to foil your racing efforts.

+ Unlockable characters

+ Graphics - Graphics on this game are great! They are up to par with that of the N64, especially considering the size of the DS!

+ Mission Mode / Battle Mode - Mission mode is self explanatory, you are given simple missions to complete. Battle mode is like that of the N64, you battle against opponents in either two challenges (you have to either pop your opponents balloons or steal their shiny stars).

+ More items - There are more items to do battle with! And of course old favorites return..

+ Wireless / Multiplayer mode - One of the best parts of the previous Mario Karts was multiplayer mode. Now you can play wirelessly with other DS players, and you only need one game cartridge! And you can also play wirelessly with people from your region or from all over the world (all you need is a wireless router and broadband internet connection)! It's true portable innovation (sometimes I can't believe I'm playing with players from halfway around the world, amazing..)

Cons:

- Wish there were some more levels - This is the only con, and its not really a con, but just a petty complaint. 32 levels is good enough (it has double the courses of Mario Kart Double Dash, and has the same amount of levels as Mario Kart 64). However, I wish they would have reprised more N64 levels..

All in all, Mario Kart DS is highly recommended for the DS! Like all other Mario games, Mario Kart DS takes a classic game and keeps it fresh and most of all retains the fun. Make this one to own!"
452455,5,This game worked like it was brand new and I got my childhood back. This is best airplane shooting game ever!
154386,5,"I enjoyed playing The World Ends With You so much. I do have a couple brief issues, but nothing enough to knock down the game's rating for me.

These are the aspects that come to mind most with the game:
- Plotline: The story is rather unique and quirky. There are plenty of surprises included that aren't easy-to-guess plot twists, as in many RPGs where it's easy to guess right away what's coming next, or what will eventually happen. I'm used to studying foreshadowing and other literary elements, so generally when I play a game or read a book, the first thing I do is speculate and lay out my guesses, but this game kept me wondering what was going to happen and who had which secrets hidden away.

- Music: The music for TWEWY gets a lot of praise it seems, and I definitely enjoyed it too. While music is different for everyone, I particularly enjoyed how it fit in so well with the environment and style of the game. Even songs I don't like, I still feel fit in so well with the game itself, and some of the songs have become total favorites.

- Battle System: I like battling with Neku. The touchscreen makes grinding a little more exciting because it's not just button-mashing, though it can get tiring after awhile. However, controlling both characters at the same time is very difficult. For many battles, this is okay: if your sync rate isn't too bad, generally leaving your partner on auto-play is fine. Other battles however, are made nearly impossible if you can't play both. One of the extra battles in particular (the hardest one of the game, imo), in the runthrough that's available after you beat the game, is highly difficult as your partner will take a lot of damage, and the enemy is hard to hit. Trying to solely control one character may leave you floundering for a few, which seems a bit unfair to me as it's impossible to be able to cover the d-pad, a/b buttons, and touch-screen at the same time.

- 100% Completion: This is generally seen as getting all the secret reports, all the items, all the item abilities, battling all the enemies in the game, and owning and mastering every pin. It is also a pain. I loved my first playthrough, but the second one to get everything the game contains has been an extremely long endeavor. Some of the bosses are ridiculously hard and MUST be fought on level hard or ultimate, while mastering all the pins and getting enough money to obtain all the items and max out friendship with store owners for ability secrets takes a LOT of level-grinding. You can spend hours straight with your HP set on as low as possible, fighting the enemies that give out the most yen, and still not be able to get halfway through the necessary buying.

- Save Points: I always notice save points (especially on the DS) because, like most, I've had plenty of emergencies or dead batteries that made it necessary to lose my hard work when I couldn't get to a save spot in time. TWEWY allows you to save at any point outside of battle or cut-scene/conversation, which is a great help - especially if your battery light goes red and you're unable to use your charger for any reason.

Overall, it's a lot of fun. The game doesn't take so much grinding that it takes forever to complete, but it is long enough to make the price worth it, and offers a lot of entertainment and enjoyment.
Those who enjoy grinding and a lot of work will probably get the most out of this game, as those will be the people ready to tackle full completion, but for those who don't like too much grinding, it's not so bad. You choose when to fight (unless it's a battle or you're prompted by a reaper for any reason to kill noise), and I found that I leveled up well enough naturally without having to spend a lot of time doing superfluous battles.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys RPGs with a bit more modern taste to them"
89767,5,"this game my be a bit outof date, but i still love it. other game creators have tried to make something better, but this one is still the best."
31858,5,"This game is extremely realistic. The control is unbelievable. However, the guys are right. It is hard to hit the ball...at all. Now, don't get me wrong. This game is VERY realistic. The computers pitcher can throw curves and sinkers and sliders. It is hard to judge but it just takes some getting used to. I bought the game and I love it. My sister wanted me to buy a baseball game so I went to my local Wal-Mart. I asked which game they sell more of. The lady said Triple Play. But I like to be different so I got All Star 2003 and immediately fell in love with it. I'd say if you want ""arcade"" gameplay, go with Triple Play. If you want TOTAL realism, go with All Star Baseball."
424805,5,"This controller is compact and easy to use. The instructions for pairing are confusing, but it works well once paired. Bought it specifically for use while using our Gear VR. The phone holder works well too. I don't think it will hold anything bigger than a Note 5, though."
397360,5,"This is a quality product. Great gameplay, skill trees/upgrades, an RPG leveling system, vehicles, and even sandbox-y open areas. Graphics look excellent on PS4, and the whole toys thing is done well and is innovative (the base lights up which lights up the light sabers of the characters if you get the special Light FX versions). Split screen multiplayer at any time makes this great for parents and their little ones, and different characters can be played by swapping out their toy at any time.

Only thing I'd note here is that once you put the disc into the PS4, it's playable immediately, but DO NOT do this. Most PS4 games require a small portion of the game to be installed before it lets you launch them, and this is for a reason. With my experience with Infinity 3.0, as soon as I started playing it was apparent parts of the first opening level had not been loaded in yet, preventing progress. Anakin has to melt a door with his light saber but there was no door. When I restarted the door had finally appeared, but then the next part, which is a tower you topple over with the force to use as a bridge, hadn't loaded in yet (there was no tower). My advice is to put the game in, wait 10 minutes at the PS4 home screen for it to fully install, and then start playing!

Otherwise, what a cool, innovative product. Thumbs up!"
164589,5,"This is an arcade style combat flight simulation game.  That said the makers of this game have gone to great lengths to make sure that every flight simulation detail is in place.  The are no landings or take-offs in any scenario, but don't let that discourage you from buying the product.  If your looking for non-stop flying action this is the game to have.  It's best to have a computer capable of providing full graphic and simulation fun.  H.A.W.X. will test your flying skills and your ability to manage the battle.  The game features the ability of the player to control additional aircraft with simple key board commands to press the attack.  The game does not stop there...you can play online with your friends or others and on your own LAN network.  Strap yourself in and get ready for non-stop action!!"

Oh, did I metion the fact ur able to shell out pre-recorded 50 cent spoken insults at will by clicking one the joysticks.

204906,5,"PROS

+ Very detailed graphics. Very smooth running game for such a detailed open world.
+ Amazing storyline, but not to overwhelming to get lost in.
+ Auto-save feature is perfect. Saves every time you do anything.
+ Side missions are vast and huge, which greatly add time to Arkham.
+ Once you complete the story mode it opens Arkham City in a free roam.
+ Soundtrack is great! Perfect for a Batman game, very atmospheric and moody.
+ Over 400 Riddler Trophies to find hidden and in puzzles.
+ Playing as Catwoman greatly adds depth to the game and is a lot of fun.
+ A lot of challenges once you complete the game.

CONS

- Actual story is quite short. I beat story mode in 3 days. However side missions will keep you busy for weeks. All depends on how you play it.
- Combat can get repetitive, just like in Arkham Asylum.

First off, I have completed the entire story mode, which I did in less than 3 days. However I skipped some of the side missions. There are many side missions which can be quite time consuming. Really, Arkham City is what you make of it, how you play it. You could take your time and get a good 25-30 hours out of it. Or you could just rush through and miss half the game in side missions. I have completed all but a few side missions and found a vast majority of the Riddler trophies. I would say I have put a good 20 hours into Arkham City thus far.

Arkham City is a pretty large city. When I heard it was open world I expected a bit more area, but really it is more than enough considering the mayhem on each street corner. Gliding above the city listening for an act of violence to swoop in on is a lot of fun. When you're not focusing on the main story missions there are at least 12 side missions as well as assaults to rescue people from and Riddler trophies to find and solve. There is a lot to do.

Arkham City took everything we loved about Arkham Asylum and made it so much better and gave us more of what made it so great. Although Arkham City does have it's frustrations at times, it has very much gone up in my favorite games list. Very much worth owning. I will be playing this again and again."

185589,5,"Ok, first off, I am a big Beatles fan. I consider them one of the best music groups to ever have come on the music scene. I am also a Rock Band Fan. Put these two factors together and you have one deliriously happy guy.

The game was actually a surprise for me. I envisioned that the game would just have the hit songs of the Beatles, and the standard parts for guitar, bass, vocals, and drums (my favorite). But what surprised me was the production value of the game. No, the graphics won't come close to Halo 3 or Gears of War...it isn't that sort of a game. What is cool is the ambiance the game produces. It features animations of the Beatles in different venues during their career, it has some nice cut scenes between the story line segments, and the audio of the music is quite good.

Playing with the Beatles, virtually of course, is a dream come true for anyone who is a big fan of the Beatles. There is a story mode which follows the career path of the Fab Four from the humble beginnings in The Cavern, a dingy underground nightclub, to big stadiums in New York and in Japan. The screaming fans add quite a lot of believability to the whole game.

If you are not a Beatles fan, or are not a connoisseur of their music, you probably will not ""get it"" or what it is all about. Basically it is a music game that takes you on a time trip back to the past and presents the Beatles as they were. The music parts are just great and you begin to appreciate some of the complexity of the harmonies and rhythms of the pieces. Ringo Starr has to be the most underrated drummer in history. Once you experience hard and expert, you begin to appreciate the talent of Ringo.

Which brings me to a surprise in the game. Some of the lesser known songs such as ""I want to be your man"" and others show off the tight harmonies that Paul, John, and George were able to produce. Oldies fans think the Beach Boys had tight harmonies, but listen to some of the songs of the Beatles and you'll see and hear what real tight harmony sounds like.

In short, I know this review is biased because I am a fan of the Beatles. As a fan, I score it a solid 5 for nostalgia and outright freaking fun. For non-fans, they'll give three stars and say, ""So what's the big deal?"" Too bad for the latter group because they've just dismissed one of the great experiences in music history.

Now I must go...I have to beat Paperback Writer on Expert Mode. :D"
486278,5,great  game
408581,5,"Someone else said it but I will re-iterate their thoughts: This is the best combination of drivers like GTA, and shooters like Call of Duty. It's got it all. Grab a car, a truck, an APC, and team up with friends to take down AI bad guys. Each mission -- and there are TONS -- offers a different challenge. A lot of games say ""Play your way! Go in guns blazing, or go in stealthy."" This game fulfills that promise the best. I'm excited for what Ubisoft can do with future games and upcoming Xbox hardware.

487562,5,"This is one of my favorite games ever. I have clocked in hundreds of hours and have even started replaying it again. This is one of the most immersive games you will play on the PS3. The open-world format and the interactions you can have with other characters makes you feel transported to another world. For its generation, it is graphically stunning and has so many memorable and fascinating locations to explore."
187072,5,This was a present for my son who loves golf and disc golf.  Nice that they added disc golf to the game.
52844,5,"The MegaMan series has been one of the best video game series for the NES, and for great reason. It had precise controls, amazing graphics, and fantastic gameplay that will keep you entertained. The series even went on to MegaMan 7 for the Super Nintendo and MegaMan 8 for the Playstation, although those games don't hold much appeal compared to the NES games (They are still good games though).

Now you get to experience all eight games (Before 9 and 10) from the original series and two arcade games that are also fun to play. You gotta love the bonus content packed in here, too. The interviews, the pictures, etc....

I think it should come to little surprise that the NES games are 8-Bit thrills. MegaMan 2 and 3 are probably the highlights of this disc, due to how fans argue about which MegaMan is better: 2 or 3. One thing that sets off some fans, however, is that the A and B button controls are swapped in Anniversary Collection. But how does that change the experiences for these NES classics? It doesn't change a thing. All you gotta know is: These games are classics, and you must play them.

MegaMan 7 and 8 kinda slip away from the NES games' style. For instance, the intro and ending for MegaMan 8 are anime-styled. And there's just something that is missing from the two games that the NES games have. Who knows what it is, but I think it's the feel of an 8-Bit MegaMan title. Nonetheless, the two games are still pretty good.

Now to talk about the arcade games. I do manage to find an Ultracade cabinet with MegaMan: The Power Battle built-in, but I don't see a lot of ones that feature MegaMan 2: The Power Fighters.

Power Battle allows you to play through 6 robot masters and 2 Wily bosses. You can choose to play a course selection of either MegaMan 1-2, MegaMan 3-6, or MegaMan 7 (8 wasn't made yet when this game came out). As you may already know, the game takes the bosses from the mentioned games and it has you fight them to move on. It's kind of like how the NES games do it, except without the stages themselves, and only the boss battles. MegaMan: The Power Battle is actually an easy game, but, like all the other MegaMans in this collection, it's still a good game. Co-op multiplayer is the best part of this game. You can play with a friend and together you can defeat Dr. Wily and his robots.

MegaMan 2: The Power Fighters is a bit more challenging than Power Battle. Now you don't get to choose which robots to face from certain games. You're given the ones that are just shown depending on which mission you chose to do. It plays similarly to Power Battle, despite those things.

Overall, this is one awesome game collection. MegaMan fans should definitely pick this up."

234266,5,"Assassin's Creed is a franchise I've loved from the very beginning. I remember playing and beating the first game in its entirety dozens of times. I remember talking to friends, theorizing what it all meant, where they would go with it, everything. Yet, time and again, Ubisoft kept amazing me, furthering the story in every way I didn't expect. Creating these huge, jaw dropping moments game after game. And now, we receive Revelations. The game that is supposed to wrap up both Altair AND Ezio's stories, while setting up the dramatic finale for Desmond.

I love Assassin's Creed games because they demand your attention. If you're not paying attention you won't know what the heck is going on. And even though the story gets deeper and deeper they never lose sight on what's going to happen, almost as if Ubisoft has known the entire story from day one. Wrapping up one character's story satisfactorily is difficult, especially someone as loved as Ezio, but to wrap up another's as well, a character that layed the foundation for this phenominal franchise? That's just blasphemy. Yet, somehow they acheived their goal. They acheived it in such a way that brought tears to my eyes.

GAMEPLAY.

A lot of the fun of AC games is the allure of climbing buildings and assassinating guards. That's here in top form. Ubisoft really tried to build upon the fantastic fighting controls the introduced in Brotherhood but it all kinda feels exactly the same. That's not a bad thing, Brotherhood's controls were spot on. The introduction to the hookblade is what should excite the most people. The kills you can perform with that thing are so intense that I found myself cringing and yelling in excitement at the same time. Past that a few problems still linger. Randomly jumping off a building, aggrivating camera angles at times, and the new irritating guards that have a gun and a sword.

STORY.

Masterful. They did exactly what needed to be done. From beginning to end the story is gripping and doesn't let go until those credits start rolling. Even then, you'll have to collect your jaw from the floor. The Altair missions that tell us how he ended up living out the rest of his life are beautiful, Ezio's struggle to realize and accept how deep the Brotherhood really reaches was well done and even Desmond's efforts to regain his body is full of excellent looks into each character.

OVERALL.

Despite its blemishes, Revelations is a beautiful game in both delivery and playability. Longtime fans will rejoice in seeing the long overdue end to Altair and Ezio, and will also surely look forward to seeing how Desmond's story ultimately plays out. Ubisoft outdid themselves with this game. To top what we're given here is gonna take a lot of effort, though I have all the faith in the world in them. Highly recommended."

176731,5,"I've been playing Rock Band for about a year now, and when I heard about the chance to add symbols onto my Rock Band 2 drum set, I licked my lips faster than a pack of teenage girls at a John Mayer concert. Then I heard they were from Mad Catz, the creators of countless horrid controllers throughout my generation of gaming, each with it's own 'turbo' button. Ugh. Needless to say, my expectations were curbed, but the Neil Pert in me just made me buy these.

Now I bought the double pack instead of the triple pack, but the idea is the same...clamp them onto the existing drum set, drop the connectors into the back, and you're ready to slam the symbols. The setup was easy, and they haven't moved since I put them on. Apparently, your mileage may vary, but this is my review.

The responsiveness of the symbols surprised me, but it's there. Haven't missed a hit yet. The symbols do give different sounds during fills and big finishes, so that was a great discovery, and trying to guess which sound should be made adds a new dimension to drumming - it's no longer just 'green' or 'blue', it's 'which one should I hit' (of course, you can hit them both, it's just more fun to do it correctly).

If you're into Rock Band, get these. Plain and simple. I know it's Mad Catz, but maybe they're turning over a new leaf."
408143,5,Son loves this game.
78878,5,"but still overpriced, this game is bein selling since 2004 and is a nice game, but thik it could be better priced, but if you still haven't played you most."
327600,5,Thanks
219415,5,great gift for my son an I loved his face when he opened it he was so happy thank you very much
294785,5,"lots of stuff to do in this game action on demand, the case was broken when i got it but luckily the disk was unharmed."
68902,5,"This is definitely the best system Sony launched with ""PLAYSTATION"" on it. I only got Resistance: Fall of Man so far and it is great. Virtua Fighter 5 and MotorStorm are of the highlight that shipped recently."
349150,5,This game is amazing and it something that appears simple but is a wild spin on anything you thought you knew.
374149,5,This is a must have for any and all Call of Duty game fans. My son plays this a lot with his friends. Out of all of his games the Call of Duty franchise is his absolute favorite.
1192,5,"This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you haven't played this game, i don't know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube, so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game."
180267,5,"Its very hard ,theres lots to shoot at ,no shortage of enamys  . Its a good game ,Reminds me of Return to castel wolfenstine"
118686,5,super!
129276,5,"Great, exactly as described. Comes on one disc which is convenient."
295186,5,"I have played every Assassins' Creed game to date, and this is the one that really wiped the slate clean, and does something new.  By AC3 I was so tired of building up my city, going through the same routines, over and over again.  The beginning of AC4 starts out in Havana, and I had the concern that it was more...collect ""feathers"" run around, etc, until you get on your boat.  Then it opens up to a whole new game, and I am just getting started on it now."

470583,5,Fun game.

19923,5,"This game is even better then the first one. The small changes add big effects to the gaming world of gangsters. The little changes like the weather, the outside light, the way the gangsters looks. Its a much cleaner enviroment with more tougher officials and gangsters. You have way more control over these gangsters then you did in the first one. You get amazing looking cars from the mayor and also you can do drive by shootings and also bribe police. This is a must have as well. Best simulation game since the Sims."
119045,5,"I bought this controller when it was first released.  Yes I'm old.

It was awesome.

It was just as good as stock, if not better where responsiveness was concerned.  The L&R buttons took longer to break than the stock ones (a notorious issue of the era).  I didn't use the turbo options much, but on occasion I did and it worked fine.  I liked the fact it used the non-US multiple colors.  The only real difference I found other than the L&R angle, which I liked, is the X&Y buttons were domed instead of recessed.  Meh, no real difference."
367934,5,"Comfy and nice look.
Recommend for anyone looking for a soft and nice looking controller skin."
374529,5,Love it! But it doesn't fit for an Elite Controller.
200164,5,This is a good product.
6103,5,"There is not need to say anything about this, because you already know what you will be purchasing.  Final Fantasy rocks!"
419041,5,So cute! Perfect little gift for an Animal Crossing fan.  Can play as Tom on Mario Maker which made my son's day!
264562,5,finally got my ps vita screen protectors. ive bought them before and replaced them just once and man do they help keep the screen scratch free. Worth the wait!

231843,5,Great
146214,5,"I love it, my son loves it--though he hasn't learned to turn yet,ha ha ha, and even my grandparents like to play. So for me this is a game for anyone between ages of 2-70! and smiles all around!"
351200,5,"One of the best games even better! I already played it on PS3, but the improved graphics, better controller, and smooth game play make it even more epic!"
233453,5,"I used this gadget with my PS3 while I was on deployment in Afghanistan from 2012-2013. And let's just say that my PS4 plays well on it also...... Did you get that?

Just putting it out there (Whistles and walks away)...."
374503,5,"I've played campaign and multiplayer and they are both great. I especially like the campaign and haven't been able to stop playing it. I don't have much time to game but I am super interested to finish the campaign then play multiplayer. The graphics are truly a lot better than my Xbox 360 COD Ghosts. The campaign is my favorite out of all the Call of Duty's I've played (all of them since COD 4). The Exo Suit has made Multiplayer new and exciting. The Maps don't suck and I have only been killed once right after spawning, which is a lot less than all the other games I've played. I like how much you can customize your player and the perk system is very cool.

The only con I can think of with this game is it still needs cleaning up in the loading department. The time it takes after a kill to go to the ""killcam"" is too long in my opinion. That is expected and will probably be fixed with updates.

It is a new and improved Call of Duty with great new ways to have fun."
129513,5,"good game to have for a collection to have i'll wait for a six months to play it again and wait another six, play again"
253844,5,"Thanks Microsoft for using cheap parts. I used the hot water cold water trick on my old one, but when it breaks, I got plenty of back ups."

339662,5,It does what its supposed to good prise.
352524,5,I love this game thanks vary much Amazon
375283,5,this game is awesome. the story is dark scary themed and very suspenseful you never know what's gonna happen next or how your decision making in the game will affect the story as you progress further. me personally with the next gen console love a game with both good graphics and a good story line or fun gameplay. this game has all those things the graphics are beautiful by far one of the best if not the best on the market. you can really see the emotions they are feeling through they're facial expressions
195369,5,Mario at his finest! Fun game for kids and adults of all ages !
257423,5,I find it very similar to 1701 AD but with a few upgrades and a few unlikely changes. Great for any age.
152924,5,excellent product!
492939,5,I love this series!
239146,5,This was a great experience. I don't play games often anymore as I get older but this actually kept be seated for more than 30 minutes. I was very impressed by this game and story. It's MUCH BETTER than Heavy Rain as Heavy Rain was the first kind of game like this. I only played through once as the developer recommends only playing it once for the best experience. My copy is currently on ebay waiting a new home.
131464,5,The new way to drive Mario cart is great even though the game could use a little tweaking.  The small size of the wheel makes it easy to hold up and steer smoothly without over correction.  Takes a little getting used to but better than connected units.
331792,5,"I originally discovered PDP from their Xbox 360 controllers and the original Kinect mount, so I didn't hesitate to get the Xbox one kinect mount. It's just as well built as the 360 one, and I love it so far. A+."

266811,5,Great game!
485697,5,I'm looking forward to getting all the elements of different skylanders they all have different abilities there amazing
187650,5,"this game was one of the sickest. i had never heard of it, was looking for a decent under rated game. all my searching led to this gem! wow! don't know where to start. its got a bit of everything. i don't want to compare this to any other game. yes it has some similarities to other games, but stands very well alone. first person shooter with lots of fun guns, all upgradeable. you have a TMD on one hand which is a time manipulation device. the things you can do with this are fun. and doesn't get old. the story is cool. about an alternate turn of events after a certain war and Russia is the world's strong power, instead of USA. it's sweet all this and the multiple endings. you jump through time to 1955 back to 2010. this game is pretty scary. lots of cool monster enemies. epic boss battles.  i jumped a few times. loved the game. got all endings. not a ton of replay value, but its freaking awesome so i keep playin it. check it out. definately worth the price!"
441555,5,FUN. even better with spanish commentary!!
492325,5,My son love this toys.
197816,5,Got this for my mother.... She loves it.... So addicting..... the best wii game out right now.... If your thinking about getting it and are reading this review.... GET IT!!!! I PROMISE YOU WONT BE SORRY
253014,5,"i really love this game. as a fan of the 2nd movie this was a real treat.
picking up after the events of the 2nd and third movies, aliens infestation covers the story of a team of marines investigating the sulaco
,the marine's ship from aliens after it is found adrift in space. as you might expect there are aliens on board and its up to our team to exterminate them.
the game is fairly easy once you master the controls. i think the fact that the characters stay dead (you can find replacements)
when they die adds a nice bit of drama to the story if you like a certain marine and don't want to lose him or her.
also cool is the fact that if your character is killed by the aliens you have a chance to save them.
they will be taken to an alien nest and you have 5 mins (real time) to rescue them if you are too slow they will eventually die or if you are kind of slow (more than 3 mins but under 5) they will be implanted with an alien chestburster (this doesn't change much; you can use them indefinitely
but upon dying the alien bursts out and you lose the character for good) for weapons you get the pulse rifle(with grenade launcher) grenades, and later you get a shotgun, flame thrower, and smartgun all of which can be upgraded 3 times as well as a pistol.
i think it will please any fan of the alien movies. and i highly recommend it."
434043,5,"Great new entry in the Pokemon series. As a long-time fan, it is nice that they are still improving the games with each iteration-- it would be really easy for them to put out a sub-par product and still get sales. I have already put ~120 hours into this game (about 30 or so in the story with oodles of time in the post-game), but even with that time investment I will buy it again for the Nintendo Switch and play through again :P.

Some of the great quality of life improvements over the previous games:

No more HMs
Previously, you had to make room on your Pokemon for story-based moves (and have specific types of Pokemon in your party), but this is no longer the case!

Great story
The story in this game is one of the best in the series, possibly the best (over B/W), though this will probably differ somewhat based on personal taste

UI Improvements
If you ever had to look up type matchups to see if a move was Super Effective/ Not Very Effective, you are in luck: after you have battled a Pokemon, your move effectiveness is always displayed on your moves in the lower screen.

IV Judging all Pokemon in your PC boxes at any PC
This is huge for anyone that breeds Pokemon: after unlocking it, you can see the IVs for any Pokemon in your PC (which streamlines the IV checking process significantly).

EV display in Summary screen
This is a slight step back (as you could normally see this in the bottom screen at any time), but when you press the Y button on a Pokemon Summary it shows you the current EV investment for the Pokemon (with sparkles if a stat is maxed). It is nice having the same UI for the IVs and EVs in the same spot.

Basically, if you have ever liked Pokemon (or just want to try a fun game), try this out. It is totally worth it. If you are thinking of trying another Pokemon game after Pokemon GO, you will not be disappointed-- the actual gameplay here is so much better. Just buy this and a fitbit :P."
399871,5,"I have the smaller new 3ds Pokemon anniversary edition. I wanted a case that could hold everything I could need to just throw this thing in a suitcase for a weekend trip and this works well.
The pocket for the 3DS itself is my favorite, it is soft cloth and can Velcro shut so you can fit pretty much any size 3DS into it, XL or not.
I have no real issues with this product, the zipper and material are all good material and well made!"
354093,5,good game
430248,5,This controller works well. I bought it to play Shovel Knight because I do not like using the big WiiU controller that comes with the system for platforming games. It paired easily and also works for the original Wii as well. I prefer the directional pad for controlling the character on screen for platforming games. the directional stick is just a little slippery when it comes to those types of games in My opinion.. Great controller you will not beat it for the price!
467073,5,LOVE IT
302518,5,Works. Great

139940,5,"My nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our Wii. Once I purchased the game for him, we found out that the Wii controllers won't work with the gamecube games when played in the Wii. After doing a little research, I realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card. Once we got both of those, the gamecube game that we bought finally worked! He is happy!"

27764,5,"Golden Sun is a flashback to some of my favorite SNES RPG's, and looks quite good for a gameboy game.  I haven't been this excited about an RPG since the original Pokemon craze, and although Golden Sun's story line is rather linear, you'll definitely spend hours on end playing it.  GS also packs many graphic details into such a small console, making the battle scenes memorable and stretching its entertainment value a bit farther than other games such as Eye of the Beholder, who's characters look not only their respective 10 years old, but the lack of any detail distracts from its overall gameplay.
I'd recommend it for any RPG fan, just don't expect FFX when it boots up."
122274,5,Ok
21159,5,"First of all, I have always been a big pokemon fan, so anything with pokemon is fun to me. A lot of people say it's  boring and the same thing over and over but if you are a real fan of pokemon it's always something new. My sister and I battle over and over, and what keeps us from getting bored is that we have one rule, well two, we can't use the same pokemon at one time, AND we can't use the same pokemon twice... so each time we battle it's new types, new attacks , etc..

I just bought a gameboy transfer thing so I can play my red version on the tv then use the pokemon on the game, I AM VERY EXCITED.

Anyway yeah, if you are a REAL pokemon fan, you will love this game."

234887,5,"PREFACE: I'm an ""old school"" gamer in my 30s, who plays games only for their campaigns. Multiplayer looks like fun, but I simply don't have the time to get into it, given my job, obligations, and other interests. All of my reviews are based SOLEY on campaigns, and they are simply my own opinions. I typically enjoy games that can be completed in an afternoon or evening, due to my schedule, and the fact that I grew up with games like ""Bonk's Adventure"" and ""Contra"". Nowadays, I like shorties like ""Journey"" and ""Limbo"". If you can live with this, please read on!

Wow... just wow. Activision did what seemed like it may very well be impossible, and delivered their most exciting campaign yet, besting even MW2 and Black Ops. The intensity of this game, and its breakneck pacing, simply cannot be adequately described in words. By the time the final credits rolled, I was actually sweating and shaking a little bit- I felt like I had been in the heat of the battle! Time to debrief with a couple of cold beers!

Unlike most of the COD games, they don't ease you into this one with a nice, slow tutorial. In a stroke of genius, you hit the ground running in this game, and experience an intelligent ""on the run"" tutorial that works much better than the previous installments (while NYC is blown to pieces all around you, by the way). From that moment on, it's one mind-blowing level after another (submarine takes the cake), offering variety, visual splendor, and the most excitement I've ever experienced in a game.

The campaign is nice and short- about five hours, which is more than enough for me, particularly considering that it's five hours of straight action, as opposed to any backtracking or filler. There is not one wasted moment in this campaign, and I liked it so much, I played through it a second time within days. I know a lot of people complain about the linearity and the ""roller coaster"" effect, but like a lot of other gamers, I love that! I like roller coasters, and to me, games are like interactive books or movies. I want to enjoy a ride that has been lovingly crafted, from start to finish. For those of us who grew up playing the original ""Doom"", MW3 is a remarkable testament to how far the FPS genre has come in immersing the player.

If you're looking for a game that puts you into that ""action movie experience"", it would be hard to do better than MW3, in my humble opinion. ""We're Oscar Mike!"""
355929,5,"I am really impressed with the quality of graphics and immersion in this game. The open world makes this game fascinating, as you can walk around a huge area of land with very little restriction. You feel as though you're spending time in this beautiful country. This game is not easy. It has it's moments of difficulty, even on ""Normal"" setting, and often makes you very frustrated. This is the type of game that requires a bit of forethought, planning and stealth. For the cost of this game at the moment, it's a steal."
55775,5,"The Ratchet and Clank title is perhaps the best platformer for the PS2.  There's little to criticize as far as game play goes.  You're either familiar with the game by now or you aren't.  If you aren't, rewind and go read reviews on the original.

""Up Your Arsenal"" is rushed.  Rough edges haunt the production.  The camera azimuth is just a few feet ahead of Ratchet, for example.  Be prepared to constantly mess with the camera angles.  I found a lot of areas with weird physics.  And the title name promises lots of weapons, but really, only a handful morph into something really different.  Same thing, different color.

The second title, ""Going Commando"" is the best of the series so far.  By comparison, this newest one is an embellished overworked and overthough sucessor.

But still, we're talking the best of the best.  It's a great game by any other standard than comparing it to early titles."
237224,5,My son could not be any happier to received this little game console. It is clearly a thing to keep you young teen from create riots for crazy parent.
321707,5,My son is just turning 9. He loves a challenge so this game lets him create a obstacle course and then try to beat it. Great game.

431297,5,Fun times just like the good old days
178584,5,"Little Big Planet it like nothing else, and it defies easy classification. To say there has been some hype surrounding this title would be an understatment. But even now that the game has been out for some time I still can not properly articulate what makes this game what it is. And what it is is great, the whimsy and feeling of the game captures everything that makes video gaming great. You can feel the infulences of every genere and major game title from Mario to Metal Gear Solid. The ability to create, customize and upgrade is simply amazing.

Little Big Planet very much feels like a transition game, like the start of a new era. This is the beta of a new style of gaming. That isn't to say that the first person shooters, role playing games and the like will go away, they won't. But this game goes a long way to proof the concept that a game can be more than a collection of challenges or gun fights.

I do not understand exactly who this game is designed to appeal too, since I've seen fans across the spectrum. From the hardcore gamer to the casual, everyone I have introduced to this game has loved it. It is easy to pick up and play but offers a huge amount of complexity and depth for those willing to commit the time. The variety and polish of some of the stages showing up online are amazing, and if they are any indication this game with be making waves for a long time to come.

I think if you give Little Big Planet a chance you won't be disappointed. More so you may find that your concept of what a game is and what is possible may start to change. It is amazing when media of any sort can inspire that sort of change."

41984,5,"In some ways, a classic video game series is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, developers are carrying on a tradition, a legacy. They've earned thousands (dare I say millions?) of devoted fans, and their names will almost assuredly be carved deep into the halls of video game history. Their work will go out into a remarkable number of homes, almost immediately after release. But, by that same token, each individual follow-up title is met with ridiculous scrutiny and astronomical expectations. No longer are these developers and programmers merely entertaining the public, they're toying with electronic mythology. It's all black and white, they're either delivering ""the best title since.."" or they're raping their own legacy. Rarely will a highly anticipated sequel be met by a lukewarm response from fans of the series, they'll either love it or they'll hate it. And, for the most part, a major change to the status quo is viewed as a bad thing.

So it should come as no surprise that many long time fans of the series were immediately turned off when early screens of Link on the GameCube, digitally rendered in all his glory, were replaced by a childlike, cartoony new appearance. When Miyamoto and the rest of the team trashed those old renders and went in an entirely new direction, fans felt alienated. Betrayed. I should know, I counted myself among them.

Within the first three minutes, my worries were washed aside. Graphically, this is as much of a leap forward from ""The Ocarina of Time"" and ""Majora's Mask"" as those revolutionary titles were from ""A Link to the Past."" It's still filled with the same great gameplay experience you grew to love on the NES, SNES and N64, yet it's pleasantly a beast unto itself. Truly, this was the right step for the masters behind the Zelda series to have taken.

The gameplay is a near-flawless translation of the system broken in by the N64 titles, at the same time benefiting from the modifications made to the GameCube's controller. Where the N64 controller offered four directional ""C"" buttons (which were used to activate items in your inventory), the GameCube offers a second analog stick, labeled the ""C stick"", which is used to control the camera angle. Items are now activated through the use of the X, Y and Z buttons, a layout which requires some minor adjustment due to the ""Z"" button's location, away from the other two. Assaults are performed with the ""B"" button, and various actions are all done with ""A"". Players may lock onto enemies with ""L"", and the ""R"" buttons gets Link down on his belly and enables him to parry attacks with his shield.

Though the system remains magnificent, there remain two fairly glaring problems with this layout. For one, the player still cannot control if and when Link jumps or climbs. This particular flaw becomes critical when navigating small ledges or attempting to scale relatively short walls, as the little man on the screen will occasionally choose to plummet to his doom without a moment's notice. I've nearly lost my mind, standing in front of a three foot wall that my character simply refused to climb. The second problem I had was with the camera control. In ""The Wind Waker,"" pulling back the camera also lifts it skyward. So, if I want a wider view of my surroundings, I also lose a lot of my range of vision and must maneuver Link from above. Needless to say, this is not ideal.

My largest gripe with this new Zelda lies in its sound. As a next-gen system running custom DVDs, the GameCube has more than enough room to allow for high quality, dolby-style audio tracks. This system should be pumping out better sounding tracks than your average CD, as evidenced by the tight ambient soundtrack of Metroid Prime. Instead, Zelda falls back on the same old MIDI-sounding synth score we endured on the N64. Many of the songs are exactly the same as heard on ""Ocarina"", with only a few slight tweaks and modifications, which is an undeniable no-no for a title of this magnitude. Imagine if the Ocarina of Time had shipped with the same screeches and dings heard on the NES original.

As far as graphics are concerned... I've seen cel shading done well in the past, but absolutely nothing can hold a torch to what's been accomplished with ""The Wind Waker."" Everything has been accounted for, from the big picture to the tiny details. Afterthoughts such as the water bursting off the front of your boat and tiny clouds of dust kicking up beneath your feet on a beach are attended to with uncanny attention to detail. When your character climbs from the water, he'll drip dry for the next few minutes. A monstrous enemy resembling a warthog marches through several dungeons on his hind legs. His lower lip juts out, flapping in the wind, and individual bits of saliva sail through the air with his every move. It's incredible. There are more frames of animation in that enemy's lip than in all of the original Zelda. Taking this game in is more than just an experience. It's a revelation.
As one package, this is an unbelievable game. If it weren't for the mild, yet necessary tweaks required of the controls and the sore lack of acceptable music and audio, I might be tempted to call this perfect. As is, the remainder of the game is good enough to account for the inexcusable audio and then some. The storyline is utterly enveloping, while the gameplay is everything you'd expect. The Wind Waker is a tremendous step for the GameCube, reaffirming Nintendo's place in the industry and capturing the imaginations of anyone willing to give it a chance. Don't let your preconceived notions about the shift in visual style fool you, this belongs in your collection right alongside the other titles in the legendary series."
46304,5,"Let me start with a short introduction.
I never played Ion Storm's original Deus Ex.  Or to be more accurate, I didn't play enough of it to be able to make a worthwhile comparison.  I read some previews of the new game, Deus Ex: Invisible War, and became really intrigued: it didn't sound like anything I'd played before.  I began to wonder if I should play the original first.  About this time, word starting spreading about changes made to the game design - changes that many fans of the first were very displeased with.  Once hearing this, I decided I'd forego playing the first and dive into IW cold - I wanted to play the game for its own merits without judging it against its predecessor (no matter how superior the original game was touted to be).  Since my home computer can't handle the PC version of the game, I played the Xbox version by default.  As a result of this process, this may seem like a naive review, as I can't comment on anything regarding the previous game, but on the other hand, I am judging it on its own, without comparison.
Intro over.
It's very difficult to say anything specific about IW regarding the plot, because so much of the plot is tied directly to the actions and decisions of the player.  But I can say that the game starts off with a bang.  Almost immediately you are wondering whom to trust, which path to take, what items to use.  The rules of the IW universe are explained at the beginning, but only in brief terms: for the large part, the player is left to fend for him/herself (you can choose Alex D's sex).  The game manual is quick to point out that there are no ""right"" or ""wrong"" choices in IW - events unfold, doors are opened and closed, and the story changes depending on what Alex D decides. Should you side with Group 1, knowing it will anger Group 2?  How will your decision affect the future?  It's very rare that any game allows this kind of freedom to players, and at time it's almost overwhelming (especially at the beginning).  But the further you progress, the more sense things make, the stronger your character's identity becomes, and you begin to appreciate more and more what Ion Storm has accomplished.
Alex D. is an agent who is able to be fitted with biomodification canisters, five in all, one for a specific region of the body.  These ""biomods"" give Alex superhuman abilities, ranging from enhanced speed or strength to limited invisibility, among others.  Illegal black-market biomods are particularly interesting.  The biomods allow the player to tailor Alex to be a stealthy type of agent, a virtual ""Terminator"", or something in between.  Adding to this customization is a range of equipment (firearms, swords, grenades, etc) which can also be upgraded to suit a particular style of play.  This system is brilliant because in the world of IW, nothing is straight-forward - there are many ways to pass obstacles.  Alex D. can charge into a heavily guarded room with guns blazing, sneak through air shafts, or hack into a security system and cause automated turrets to fire upon ""friendlies.""  And these are just a few of the many options.  You never feel forced to take any single path in IW - an amazing feat, especially when you consider the depth of the story - and experimentation is often  rewarded.
IW may seem shorter than most RPGs, but you must remember that this game is almost designed to be replayed.  You can reach any one of several endings in almost countless ways.
Invisible War is a beautiful game.  No, it doesn't run at a particularly high frame-rate, but the environments are so detailed and so interactive, it's a small price to pay - you'll cease to notice it unless you're really making an effort to look for it.  The vaunted Havok physics engine can be pretty silly, but it makes the world that much more immersive and allows for a lot of creativity on the part of the player.  The lighting is 100% real-time, and is probably the best to be seen to date.  Player models are convincing - not perfect, perhaps, but they get the job done very well.  All told, the IW engine performs very well.  The fact that it can look as good as it does while allowing for so much in-game experimentation is quite an achievement.
Sound-wise, there's little to complain about.  There's a lot of voice-acting in IW, and while not Pixar-caliber, it does a fine job of maintaining the immersion.  Elevator music plays in elevators, conversations can be heard everywhere, and a nice, dark, ambient soundtrack adds to the mood.  Weapons and manipulated items all fit in perfectly.
So there's a newbie's take.  Playing IW was some of the most fun I've had in the interactive media, mostly due to the high level of freedom the player is presented with.  Is it a perfect game?  No - but honestly, what is?  I wasn't quite sure what to expect going in, but I came away with the strong conclusion that Deus Ex: Invisible War is not only a masterfully crafted game.  It's a personalized experience.  It's not only one of the best game's I've played this year, it's one of the best I've ever played.
Now to track down the original.  Can it possibly live up to Invisible War??  I can't wait to find out."
246460,5,"After I brought mw2 I wasn't certain if buying another call of duty game was a smart thing to do. So to anyone that's in the same position that i was in once before to you I say BUY THIS FREAKING GAME! The actual game-play graphic is not as great as mw2 or 3 granted but it sure makes up for it in campaign and online mode. Damn, like y'all don't understand how the campaign had me on the edge of my seat, waiting the story to unfold. Its really another must have game I'd recommend."
163943,5,Its exactly what I wanted.
30446,5,"""Final Fantasy X"" is possibly the greatest RPG video game ever released, which automatically also locks it in as a contender for best game ever, period.  It'd probably be impossible to ever choose a single video game for that title, but I think I'd put this in the top half-dozen or so of  games I've ever played, on any console.

  Although I was, in the very beginning of the game, a bit disappointed in the lack of ability to choose character names (except for the 'Tidus' character, who can be renamed, as can Aeons) or characteristics (this was among the first of the 'current generation console' RPG games I played), that disappointment was rapidly blown away by what a great array of characters - including enemies and 'supporting' characters, not just the party members you play - the gamemakers had developed.  They're fully realized, helped by great animation including facial expressions; first-rate voice acting that ranks as among the best in video games and shows that their performers are just as talented as those in other fields of acting; and believable personalities and character histories that are slowly revealed, while never spelling every last thing out and letting you draw your own inferrences.  And, in a difficult feat to attain, the complex storyline doesn't overshadow the gameplay, nor the gameplay possibilities limit the range of the story.  It's instead a perfect blending of story and game, much like the equally great (but very different) ""Clock Tower 3"".

  A number of the enemies are truly challenging, in that it's not just a case of making sure you have enough hit points and the most powerful weapons available when you face them, but you really have to strategize and figure out how to beat them.  The general look of the monsters is detailed and very impressive. A number of creatures also have high 'cute appeal', which I suppose may be a minus to some gamers but which I found a refreshing change whenever they'd appear.  As the game unfolds, new revelations and angles really increase the characters's (and player's) motivations; you can get totally immersed in this.

  The basic story - or at least the beginning of it - has the Tidus character (the game's main point-of-view character) apparantly brought forward in time a thousand years to a world much less technologically advanced from the one he's from but higher in magic and beset by monsters, as well as the eternal scourge of the mega-monster Sin, the creature that attacks Tidus's home city of Zanarkand in the incredible opening.  Tidus winds up on the aisle of Besaid, befriended by a 'blitzball' player named Wakka, and meeting Yuna, a Summoner-In-Training preparing to embark on the quest many Summoners undertake but never complete, the quest of gathering enough Aeons to defeat Sin.  The true curse of the world of Spira though, is that Sin is never truly defeated, never has been over the past thousand years, and always rises again within a few years of its defeat to terrorize the planet again.  That's the situation Spira is in at the time the game's quest really gets underway.  As Tidus (or whatever you choose to rename him) everything about the world is new, and the player learns about it along with the character.  There's a full compliment of other characters who will eventually make up the full team.

  Epic, wonderfully imagined, at times hilarious, fearsome and touching, even tearful at times, ""Final Fantasy X"" runs the full gamut.  Even after you've played the game through to its conclusion, you'll likely want to go back and see what secrets there are that you Haven't unlocked yet.  Just how many Aeons are there in addition to the ones listed in the book?  How many secret cities, ruins, etc. can you really discover given enough exploration of the world map and of seemingly uninhabited deserts?  All the characters, as in all the Final Fantasy games, have a little victory dance or celebration when they win, and here each character's is unique: will Lulu ever lean forward just a little too much in the bow that constitues her 'victory dance'? (sorry, sorry, I couldn't resist.  The female characters in this game are Hot!  And it's not just Lulu's celebration that's cool to watch, it's just the only one that, uh, presents the potential..uh, never mind.)  How many different ways can the Cloudy Mirror be utilized once it's powered up?  So there's great possibilities for followup gameplay, because it's hard to find Everything the first trip around.

  Super story, super playability, wonderful characters that you really care about and function as fully engaging as the best characters in movies, books, etc.  A must-own."
80808,5,"I bought this for use with both my GameCube GameBoy player and for use with virtual console and fighting games on the Wii.

Not a single problem with it.  As long as the game itself supports configurable buttons you don't have much to worry about.  I use cordless Logitech controls with mine, I haven't plugged my Nerf Wireless into it yet.

My only complaint is Amazon thought I wanted DDR games in my suggestions after buying this.

---update---

02/12/2012 -  I got my daughter hooked on The Secret of Mana for the Wii virtual console (SNES game).  This adapter came in handy, I only had one ""classic controller"" for the Wii, so I pulled out my Logitech PS2 control, put it on this thing, customized the button layout in the game and it worked perfectly.  My biggest problem was telling a 9 year old A, B, X and Y when all she saw was square, triangle, X and circle.  I finally told her to start memorizing the buttons and quit looking."

143379,5,"I love this game, me and my little brother used to play the heck out of it til it broke, now I'm ordering another. The gun generator thing is brilliant, there's a chance to get a little bit of everything, and the arcade-like damage numbers that fall off the enemies upon being hurt is one of the many things I love about this game. I have all the DLC, so I didn't need to get the GotY Edition. Saved myself $10, all I would basically be getting is another Borderlands and a pretty case anyway."
393022,5,Functioned exacRly as advertised. I used it to buy a game. Hooray.

268676,5,"I wasn't too sure about getting a grip for the Vita. I mean it turns an already dubiously portable device into something that is straight up not portable. But the thing is, like a lot of people, I actually play the Vita the most at home and long Lumines or Uncharted sessions would destroy my fragile hands. So for less than 15 dollars, I figured I'd give the grip a chance.

To be blunt -- it is awesome. It looks/feels a bit silly at first, but the ergonomic benefits are obvious from the second you hold it. It fits the Vita tightly, the grips have a great texture, and most importantly -- it just feels fantastic in your hands.

If you don't have a Vita or only play it on the subway, don't get this -- it would be silly. Like getting a chicken coop when you don't have chickens. But if you do have a Vita and play it at home for longer than 20 minutes at a time, get this grip."
247306,5,"I can't say much about how Dark Moon holds up to the original Luigi's Mansion on the Gamecube since I've never played it, but I found this game to be a thoroughly satisfying experience. The single-player campaign consists of short levels that  while linear/directed  require a bit of exploration and thinking in order to complete. While they might take a few plays to get used to, the controls are generally easy to grasp and not too complex. Plus, sucking up ghosts with the Poltergust 5000 is a ton of fun. Anyone who hasn't played the first game is easily caught up to speed with how everything works, as Professor E. Gadd consistently reminds the player what to do and how to operate the devices Luigi uses once they're introduced.

My favorite part of the game has to be the online multiplayer, as it adds a creative spin to the already stellar gameplay and encourages teamwork rather than rivalry. You can easily find yourself killing hours here. Hunter, Rush, and Polterpup are all mostly equally fun modes that each have something pretty unique to offer. For Americans, I'd say the best time to play online is during the day. At night, finding decent players can be quite a bit difficult, and there are only a few Japanese people on there. I suspect this loosens up at some point as the time shifts in the Eastern Hemisphere, but I digress. Unfortunately, as with all multiplayer games (especially those with co-op), there are trolls who enjoy souring the experience for others by hurling spike seeds at you for some unprovoked reason, deliberately refusing to step on their tile in Rush mode, or making nary an effort to win. People bumping into you to steal your key and leaving your game before crucial moments can also be a bit frustrating. Be wary of these people!

Basically, it's a really fun game that grows on you if it doesn't impress you initially. There's plenty of content offered here without being overwhelming. Even after two years, the price for this game is still above $20 and it's well-deserved, in my opinion. Definitely recommended."
57873,5,Disc is in great condition. Kind of pricey though.
86959,5,"Though the town graphics seem sorta Dreamcasty, the rest of the games main stages are very fun and graphically appealing. Great use of colors and most of the textures are excellent. Many cut scenes are almost CG in quality, and despite the characters taller appearance, they do look really good. Voices are also well done."
126074,5,"The hype building up to the launch of this game was pretty enormous. Having missed part 1 and 2 I wasn't really sure what all the fuss was about. Sure, the commercials for GOW 3 looked pretty epic, but could it really live up to all the accolades being thrown its way? Well, I figured I would give it a chance so I lined up at the local game shop at midnight to pick up a copy so I could play it for an hour or two before getting some pre-work sleep. One or two hours soon turned into four and then five hours. I was having a very hard time making myself turn the game off as I was getting deeper and deeper into the story. I kept promising myself that I would stop at the next save point, but then I would think, okay I will just go a bit farther and then turn it off.

Let's start off with the obvious, how does this game look? GOW 3 may possibly be the single greatest looking game ever made! No effort was sparred in bringing the graphics to life. Even the smallest and most distant background items are very detailed. Everything Kratos smashes with his fist or arsenal of weaponry gets covered with blood and gore. I'm not just talking about Mortal Kombat blood for the sake of blood that disappears within a second or two of being splashed into the air. I'm talking about blood patterns that alter the way the baddies and Kratos look as you continue your mission of blood lust. Even the water that Kratos occasionally has to swim and trudge through looks insanely real as it ripples away from his movements. The lighting and shadow effects are as good or better than I've ever seen. For an example of this just check out the Helios boss battle and the cave level that follows.

Next let's look at game play. GOW 3 plays like a dream. The controls are fairly simple making switching to the right weapon for the job and being able to double jump from platform to platform completely up to the skill of the player. I will admit that this game is what a lot of people describe as a ""button masher"". You mash buttons to perform combos, complete sequences, and have an extremely intimate exchange with a goddess...yep that last one really happens. The thing about GOW 3 is that button mashing, while it only gets you so far even on the normal difficulty setting, has never been so enjoyable. The melee combat system alone gives you approximately a dozen different ways to decapitate, disembowel, stomp, or throw your enemies. If that doesn't do it for you, simply grab one of the baddies and run around using them as a battering ram to destroy other baddies. Kratos gets a handful of other weapons and items with most of them having some unique use in different situations. My weapon of choice is the Cestus which brings new meaning to the phrase ""open up a can of whoop @$s"". For an example of just how devastating the Cestus can be check out the Hercules boss battle...I mean WOW, this is some brutally epic stuff!

Finally there's the story...because if this is just random violence wrapped up in a gorgeous package would it still be fun? In this case I think so, but luckily GOW 3 has a completely enthralling story line. Even if you're like me and didn't have the experience of GOW 1 and 2 you can easily jump into this game. You're given a nearly 20 minute history lesson when you first start the game. You will be up to speed and obliterating a multitude of enemies in no time. Kratos himself is an undeniably interesting character. He is completely brash and uncaring about all the death and destruction unfolding around him due to his own actions. He is blindly driven by his rage and need for revenge which leads to intense and at moments humorous dialogue. The voice acting and mannerisms displayed by all characters could not be more spot on! I can't stress enough how epic the sheer scale and weight of this story is. Smashing your way through waves of baddies and completing puzzles to face off against one of the many truly impressive bosses hasn't been this satisfying since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System! With GOW 3 clocking in at slightly over 10 hours it's a very satisfying experience whether it's your first or even fifth time playing through. And yes, this game is that deep and visually stunning that 3-5 play-throughs will feel like a breeze.

It's time to wrap this thing up! I realize I'm way late to the party when it comes to putting out my thoughts on GOW 3, but it's something I've been meaning to do for quite a long time now. If you have not picked up this game by now then you're looking at some really good timing because you can get it from around $15 used to $25 new. GOW 3 has earned its place among a very select few games ever released that can legitimately be regarded as ""best ever"". On that note, bring on God of War 4!!!"
128343,5,"This game is simply a blast. I am amazed that a PSP game is this good. As some people have mentioned, there are some loading issues, but they are not frequent and do not detract from the game. The control is very good, the force powers feel great. I say feel because it really does feel like you are wreaking some serious damage with the force!

The story is great, acting is great.

The extra stuff like the historic missions and the force duel modes, are great and are not found in the console versions. Lots of replay value here. There is multiplayer, but it is ad-hoc only, no infrastructure. However SONY has something in the works called Ad-hoc party, where if you have a PS3, you can use it to bridge over and play ad-hoc over the internet/infrastructure. So it will be some day soon.

A must buy for any PSP owner, very addictive game!"
360107,5,"The headphones feel a little cheap, but man do they sound good. Definitely worth 15 bucks."
48356,5,"The game starts off pretty ordinarily - people are getting kidnapped, sidekicks introduce themselves. You may start yawning at the start, thinking it's just Starfox Adventures Part 2. But there is much more of a purpose to everything you do in this and you actually start to care about the characters. The world is thankfully compact yet full of things to do. You will need to solve puzzles (some quite clever) but the solution is never too hard to work out. This game includes ideas that have been seen elsewhere but does it with humour, style at a great sense of atmosphere. In some ways, it reminded me of the Monkey Island series, with the old town on an island full of characters. You could imagine pirates rather than robots roaming around. Ubisoft are a French company and the town has a distinct Gallic look to it. It's very well drawn and a welcoming place to go if you want a bit of time out from the adventure. You can play games in the bar, for instance.
The voice acting is great - I particularly like the announcer on the races (that are a bit like Star Wars Episode 1.) A sizeable section of the game is taken up with stealth sections. Now, I'm not a stealth fan generally but Beyond Good and Evil manages to make it very fun without losing the tense atmosphere necessary. The guards are both very threatening, wearing spotlights, heavy armour and with the power to command a hovering guncraft to shoot you or to send lasers in your general area. And, yet, when you manage to overpower them, they stumble around bewildered in a comical way. I don't want to spoil things but there are some very funny ways of finishing off the guards.
The sound is great, ranging from dark and moody to Jamaican and a bit of French pop/hip hop.
The graphics were specially designed (the 'JADE' engine) and the same engine was used on Prince of Persia. It's difficult to tell it was because both games are distinctly different.
Jade appropriately wears a lot of green, has green lipstick and green features as a recurring colour throughout. The main characters have been really well drawn. You almost forget that Jade isn't real- she's like a young French film star and her expression can change from wryly amused to fearful within a second.
One part of the game is particularly cinematic- a chase across the rooftops. It's like a throwback to a Hitchcock film like North by North West and, though short, it's really well done. The designers obviously had aspirations to make this game film-like and they have succeeded. The scenes at the lighthouse towards the end are beautiful.
One of the few disppointing parts was the last level. Not only is it small but it performs the unforgivable error of having un-necessarily long corridors and a virtual absence of puzzles- an otherwise entertaining game pretty much fizzles out amid a cliched alien enivronment.
Also- and Zelda is the worst offender though it is also seen in this game and Starfox Adventures- why does a game that is based upon the traditional fairytales of good versus evil and swordfights and magic resort to something as stupid as making the character levitate upwards on certain warp points? This idea is pure Star Trek awfulness that is at odds with the simple core of adventure that these stories should be trying to convey. Even Prince of Persia does it."
109094,5,"I'm not going to review the playing of this game, since it was purchased for my husband and grandson to play. My 5 yr old is quite the video game enthusiast (and hate that we limit his game play time to one hour a day), as is my husband (who should have his game play time limited!). They play this together and thoroughly enjoy themselves. It's not a game where the ending is easily accomplished, as they've now been playing it for more than a week and are only 25% of the way through. It does seem to play much the same as the other Lego video games, so it had a short learning curve for them. It was surprisingly quickly shipped, which is great, because my grandson hates the wait once we order something. Overall, the perfect game for the Lego video game enthusiasts."

420663,5,Thank you.
89766,5,"Back in the heady days of PC gaming in the late 1990s, the first person shooter came of age.  Games like Jedi Knight, Half-Life, Shogo, and Unreal represented a turning point from the age of Doom's basic, no-frills FPS action, with fully 3D graphics and actual attempts at atmosphere and story.  Of these, it was Unreal that, for many, represented the technological forefront of graphics tech at the time.  Unreal was one of the first games that combined hi-res graphics with larger, more open environments that actually sort of resembled realistic graphics.  The original Unreal (and its expansion, Return to Na-Pali) was an expansive single-player shooter with a decent multiplayer component.  Its first sequel, Unreal Tournament, however, was completely focused on competitive multiplayer, although it featured bots for offline players to battle in solo matches.  A few years later, Epic released Unreal Tournament 2003, which debuted the new Unreal Engine 2 graphics engine.  It was quite a leap in terms of graphics, and as a result, greater diversity in environment and atmospherics were possible.  UT 2003 was followed by Unreal 2, the full-fledged sequel to the single player original Unreal.  While it boasted great atmosphere and graphics, in a post-Halo gaming world, it struggled to successfully compete.  Criticized for an anemic storyline that was barely linked to the original Unreal, a shallower, shorter experience than the original, and an inability to truly keep up with the innovations that had take hold in the FPS world, Unreal II was viewed as more a tech demo than anything.  Unreal Tournament 2004, on the other hand, returned to Unreal's multiplayer side with great success.  Boasting all the content from UT 2003, plus new maps, game types, and the introduction of vehicles, UT 2004 is regarded by many as the high point of the series.  Unreal Tournament 3, released in 2007, may be far better looking, but for the majority of Unreal fans, it never got better than UT 2004.

Unreal Anthology compiles Unreal, the Return to Na-Pali expansion, Unreal Tournament, Unreal 2, and Unreal Tournament 2004 onto a single DVD (UT 2003 isn't included as its content was included in UT2004).  While there are some pieces of free add-on content from UT 2004 not included, and the Unreal 2 multiplayer XMP add-on is not included, you can download the UT 2004 content fairly easily (search for ""Unreal Tournament 2004"" and ""Mega Bonus Pack"", as well as the Windows XP Extras pack).  You will need to also locate the Unreal Anthology Patch Tool Setup file, so that you can easily use mods and user-created maps.

This brings me to my next, very important point: while Unreal Anthology is already a great deal with the included content, to truly get the most out of it, you'll need a high-speed internet connection and access to sites where you can download user-created UT2004 maps and mods.  Despite what conventional wisdom may indicate, UT2004 can be a great experience for a solo player; it's just that having a huge array of maps and custom characters is what will keep it from becoming boring to the offline player.  Once you've grabbed the user-created maps/mods, and extracted them, get yourself a big, ol' flash drive, and save the maps folder to it so you don't have to go through all that work again if you have to get a new computer.  When I finally upgraded to Windows 7, it was just easier to copy the all the content folders, and merge them with my installed Anthology folders on the new computer, than individually unzip everything again.  Using Windows 7 Pro Edition, I haven't had any compatibility issues yet, running it in XP Service Pack 3 compatibility settings.

The games themselves are entertaining, and recall an era when graphical advances actually helped gameplay, rather than leading to ""dumbing it down"" and feature shrinkage.  The original Unreal may feel a bit long in the tooth, but it still holds up as a solid shooter.  And while Unreal 2 was criticized for its long load times, and relatively standard gameplay, on today's computers, it can run pretty well fully maxed-out, and the gameplay isn't really bad at all.  In fact, the atmospheric feel of the Unreal universe is conveyed well here.  As for Unreal Tournament 2004, as I said above, with countless maps available, and an emphasis on ridiculously fast, adrenaline-focused action, it's a great experience online or offline.  The sprawling Onslaught maps allow some rather ridiculous amounts of chaos to unfold, while fast-paced Deathmatch or Capture the Flag arenas tighten up the action for instant gratification ultra-violence thrills.  Also of note are the Assault maps, which while underrepresented compared to other game types, provide an interesting change-up with specific objectives reminiscent of single-player based games.  If there's a ""weak sister"" in this collection, it's the original Unreal Tournament.  It's not that it's a bad game; it's more the fact that while the other 3 games each fill a specific niche here (old school single-player FPS, slick 2000s high-production value single-player FPS, and massive, multi-mode competitive FPS), UT99 doesn't really offer much that UT2004 can't already provide.

At its current price as of the original writing of this review, Unreal Anthology is an absolute steal for the number of hours you'll get out of it.  However, you'll need that online bandwidth to fully access all the great content out there, that will complete this collection.  That being said, I give Unreal Anthology a top tier recommendation. (As an aside, Unreal Tournament 3 is relatively cheap these days as well, and makes a good companion piece for this collection.  While it doesn't quite match up to UT 2004, with the user-created maps, it's not shabby at all.)"
94529,5,"Bought this because the HDMI output on my PS3 stopped working and the cheap $3 component cable I originally bought left horrible interference on the TV and in general a bad picture.

439544,5,Corsair mouses always feel premium and this is mouse is no exception. It's great for those who like to edit and work on stuff that having those extra bottoms as shortcuts is so very nice. If you like playing mmos then this mouse is for you. I highly recommend them as I have had no issues with them.
253908,5,Wire free is the way 2 be. My friends tell me it's like I'm in the room.  The noise cancellation leaves fans in the background out very well.
221225,5,The only modes I've used in this game are HR derby and Franchise.  The Derby is authentic.  Franchise is very good.  Could be better in very few areas.  The longer you go the less talented the draft classes become.  You could find A potential players in the 3rd round.  In the 2030 season It's tough to find one in the first round.  I only play in Broadcast mode and have never tried Fast Play because I like the live baseball game feel of Broadcast.

1229,5,"I have to say this is the absolute best Legend of Zelda so far...  But there is one thing I have to clarify THIS IS NOT THE FIRST LEGEND OF ZELDA!!!  The first came out on the NES and is Great to play....  This one has good control, fun plot, and will get you so wrapped up in it, you'll come screaming back for more."
449557,5,yay
322497,5,Cut scenes are great. My four year old and I love playing this. She loves being Wildstyle!! Great family game. Get it.
100810,5,I have been using this charger for almost a year and I have no complain about it. It worked perfectly. the fold-away prong is so convenient even if you don't travel
65986,5,Owned this game when it first came out. Foolishly sold it back to gamestop. Had no idea its value at the time. Will never do that again!
242445,5,my kid is very happy with the product... he is very happy with the game and the characters on the screen..
57238,5,"I was simply amazed by Resident Evil 4! It's been a long, long time since I've played such a compelling, terrifying, and all-around enjoyable game!
Although I give RE4 a hands-down 5 stars, I'll touch on some things here:

Story: an intriguing storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to know what happens next? Rare in the world of video games, but definitely a highlight of RE4. It's a severe departure from the other RE games, in my opinion, so prepare yourself for an experience somewhat different than what you've come to know of the RE series, but one that's just as exhilirating!

Gameplay: the mechanics of this game are borderline flawless! Once you get the hang of the shooting system, which might take you a second to adjust to, it's rewarding. There is a fun quick-time system that makes cutscenes more interactive and interesting. Not to mention countless little touches that made the controls and gameplay options rich, diverse and fun to use.

Graphics: so lifelike! Such a graphic and realistic graphics system really ads to the scare-factor, not to mention that the whole game is just nice to look at. Top notch, definitely.

Sound: the voice actors were, for the most part, wonderful. A chilling soundtrack was well done and really ads to the feel of the game. Not to mention environmental details that, paired with the graphics, make you feel like you've walked right into hell.

I would definitely name this my favorite entry in the RE series! I appreciate the slightly different direction they took with it, and thought it was a rich, well-crafted experience! Check it out!"
21621,5,"It still surprises me how many fans of the Civilization series missed out on this one.  Created by Sid Meier, a legend in the computer gaming and also the creator of the aforementioned Civilization games, this game reached a zenith that few video games ever dream of reaching.  It's funny, but Civ 3 is actually a throw-back when compared to Alpha.
I've played a lot of strategy games, both real-time and turn based, and Alpha Centauri reigns supreme for replayability.  There's so much going on with all the different advances,  secret projects, customizable units and the like that you can play it over and over again and never get bored with it.  One of the things that bothers me about Civ 3 is the total lack of a multiplayer element.  After playing Alpha for a couple of years, I was certain that Civ 3 would use all those ground-breaking multi-player features like an in-game voice chat (no third party software necessary) modem to modem gaming and even a play by e-mail.  No such luck.  After buying Civ 3 and playing it for a month, my friends and I went right back to Alpha.
Alpha also has something else that Civ 3 doesn't: an extremely good story.  The ongoing battle between the different factions is eventually eclipsed by the restlessness of the sentient planet they'd come to call home. There are several paths to victory, the easiest being conquest and the most difficult being transcendence.  What other game will you ever play where the ultimate goal is to reach a higher plane of consciousness and even a form of omnipotence?
Alpha is the most sophisticated and intelligent game I've ever played but it can be as simple as the player desires.  Ultimately this is a game about humanity, who we are, what makes us tick and the meaning of life, or at least how we perceive it.  That's a pretty bold theme for a video game. After you've played it once, you'll find that every game after will peel back another layer of the game to reveal a new depth and intricacy.  Now that the price of this game is in the single digits there's no reason for you not to own it.  It's the Citizen Kane of video games and ages like wine.  In a field where faster and stronger pushes the envelope over creativity I can't think of another game I can say that about."
446804,5,A classic n64 game.
441026,5,bought this for my bro.... once he's off work he's always on this game... we've gone head to head and its entertaining as all fifa's have been... pretty realistic graphics... very fun!
232422,5,"Excellent, period.  We are a family of seven: 46, 42, 16, 14,12, 10, 7, 6, 3.  We all like most of the games and the software is capable of supporting all of us at different abilities easily. Most motions are realistic, careful though, some are not much at all.  We went to a smalltown bowling alley recently after bowling with this game and we were all confident of our abilities...  What a rude awakening, you can be much more precise in the game than in real life.  The flying games have you push the controllers forward to speed up, my children seem to get this, I am still lost as to how to make that work."
450611,5,Completed my trilogy with this.  Great game!!  Loved it as a kid and still love it now.
115330,5,"Wow what can I say.  One of the best games EVER.  Not only is it a great storyline with rich characters, mixed with great humor and great game control but there's practically endless amounts of weapons that are upgradeable.  This is just a great, fun and clean game for anyone that likes video games."
55464,5,"The Zelda series is arguably the greatest series of games of all time. Recent releases like Ocarina of Time and Link to the Past are some of the most polished and well made games in history. And it all started with this game...

The original Legend of Zelda still is a blast to play to this day. The graphics are decent, the sounds and music rock, and the gameplay and fun factor are through the roof. This game is still extremely tough and this is what gives it half of its fun. You cant just breeze through this game without some reflexes or care. Just see what happens when you try and rush through a room full of blue Darknuts. ;)

This game has spawned countless other titles over the years and was the first game that actually allowed you to save and continue your game at a later time. This game was absolutely GINORMOUS back when it came out, even though it can easily be beaten in about 3-5 hours today. Plus, picking up the Red Ring, and changing Links color, still puts a smile on my face today.

For this price, it is a crime not to pick this title up for the GBA or DS. The gameplay, fun, and challenge of one of the greatest games of all time should not be passed on by anyone."
163845,5,This is a good article easy to use and very good material recommend it ...
346262,5,The first Lords of Shadow was amazing i felt in love with the game the character the story and the graphics and this one is no exception. Dont buy in to the rviews of it been terrible because it really isn't it. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
419828,5,Very Great
491071,5,This one is a challenge.
177004,5,"First of all its beautiful, from the black gloss finish to the skulls on the neck and strap, to the buttons being level with the neck and not jutting out like GH guitars. Any review has its ups and downs but I see nothing wrong with the guitar as long as you give it some TLC it will take care of you too. Make sure you have the neck locked in scure or you will have the green button being non responsive. Once locked in, NEVER, never take the neck out. Keep the batteries fresh, when not playing turn it off. and finally keep in a cool dry place or since it is a full size guitar go buy a cheap case, its worth it. And last but not lease if and when you buy it, ROCK ON...."
284252,5,Cheap price and works .Most of our games won't respond to it.
252124,5,"I was struggling with my fighting gaming using the PS3 controller. It was awful. But this fighting stick, with its plug and play, showed me not just how good I actually was, but let me get significantly better the more I used it. Love it!"
276099,5,Best MMO EVER
183611,5,I love slot games and this one was a nice addition to the ones I own it's never boring and it's hours and hours of fun so if you love slots this is a must have
221477,5,"my son has been using these for about a year, no issues at all. Good purchase"
84430,5,"To preface my review, I initially was not interested in another FPS as the genre is really oversaturated, plagued by annoying players and frankly not much in the way of innovation.  I actually pick this up mainly because of a bargin price at the time.  I am glad I did because this game is awesome.

The single player is great.  It is by no means a push over as most FPS single player components are.  It offers a good challenge on any of the difficulties and the battles can get really intense.  AI is very intelligent.  They don't sit there waiting for you to kill them.  They are constantly moving instead of just running for cover and never moving from it.  The story is enough to keep you going from level to level and is good.  I also did not forget about the singleplayer game after I finished it as I usually do.

The multiplayer is also great.  Lots of options on gameplay (deathmatch, capture and hold/destroy, assassination/survive), lots of metals to earn, and lots of soldier types to keep you from getting bored.  I did not have any  problems finding matches and they come together pretty quickly.

For Parents: Very little blood and no gore.  The only thing to watch for is the near constant cursing in the singleplayer game.  Other than that nothing really offensive.

Suggestions:  If you are online, please do not use the headset unless you are in a clan.  It is really annoying for others when we can all hear your crappy music or when you are having a conversation with your mom about taking out the garbage.  You will be made fun of."
336592,5,Nice
258123,5,great game. a classic.
235590,5,"I thought this alittle easier than the other Layton puzzles. Although you zip through the first half,you run into some harder puzzles the second half. My only complaint would be the end saying you can get the password to open more puzzles in the next game. Never worked for me. Still I'm hooked on Layton as adult puzzle challange."
440962,5,"If you want a giant playground of San Francisco, Oakland and the surrounding city, parks and forest areas to explore in a game that lets you alter the game world like few open games before it, Watch Dogs 2 surpasses the positives of Watch Dogs 1 while delivering a fun adventure for open world gamers. Marcus has a ton of different uniforms and clothing combinations he can wear, so you're more than likely to find the style that you find appealing to represent yourself. Hop in a car, on a motorcycle, into a boat, truck, SUV, whatever you want and head out for the next sight seeing location or mission. This time, you also have your handy Drones to assist you, including the helicopter Drone for flight, and the little RC Car drone for infiltration. The drones are a big part of the fun of Watch Dogs 2 and are easy to control, along with Marcus, who has a lot more agility to climb things and reach new heights to see the beautiful world (and 1080p PS4 graphics) before you. Lots of activities to do as well, and you can upgrade your character outside of missions, which is nice.
This time, Marcus can also create his own weapons to a degree in addition to the standard, powerful weaponry to disable Blume Technologies, who are intent on ruling the city and the minds of its citizens. Beyond weapons, what really sets Watch Dogs apart from so many other open worlds is the ability to manipulate the world, its citizens to some degree, the vehicles, gadgets, gears, elevators, signs, robots and anything that is hackable through your cell phone. Lots of fun to have this kind of impact on the game world, and Ubisoft expands well beyond what was possible in Watch Dogs 1 with Aiden Pearce. If you love the freedom to carve your own path, Watch Dogs 2 is waiting for you. Recommended."
200182,5,Cool game thought its was one of those on line only games but its a 1 player game as well as a online game its cool worth the the 3 bucks
214126,5,"I was running out of space  on my original 20 gig xbox. New xbox runs perfect. Not loud like the original xbox is. Setup and transfer was easy, took about an hour to copy everything over using a flash drive opposed to buying the hard drive transfer kit. Would recommend to anyone with an older xbox looking to upgrade or purchasing for the 1st time. Only downside is the unit doesn't come with any hd cables like in the past. (not a big deal)"
459970,5,I love this game because not only does your character gain levels but your weapons do too when you acquire them. I would recommend this game to my friends and most importantly my best friend. It's a great game for beginners new to this type of game. This game is one of my favorite RPGs out of all the ones I played. I have found in this game that if regular attacks do not work on an enemy then jump and attack.
292398,5,got it for my wife love it
445878,5,Thanks

84509,5,"Back in 2005, I bought a Greatest Hits copy of Killzone. After I played through, I realized I had just used $20 and lost 8 hours of my life that I would never get back. The game was bad. I could care less if they had made a sequel... and boy, would I be surprised 4 years later! Guerilla's Killzone 2 is not just a VAST improvement over their first game, but a great push forward for the genre of FPS. I will not go into detail into the storyline, as it is merely a ""break"" from all the frenetic action that taked place during the single player missions. It's been a long time, well, 2 years (COD 4) since I felt so excited to get on a turret, or use the scope of my main assault rifle, or even fight off a flying vehicle. The game makes all these simple aspects of the generic FPS and heightens them with great spawn points, amazing graphics, and smart A.I. No game can compare to the graphics on display here. The amount of detail is outstanding! When one shoots an enemy soldier, who then falls on some trashbags, which then burst with trash fliying out, you know the desginers put alot of love to their game, and here, it shows. The level design is unique and truly cinematic, and though the game is rather short, the online multiplayer will keep you popping in that Blu-Ray disc back many times. Overall, a game that will be looked upon for inspiration, both in a technical and cinematic view. A perfect 5 out of 5. :D"
147926,5,"I couldn't be more right! with this game I started my journey on PS3 and was excellent. Fluid gameplay, interesting plot, my new kind of superhero that either take good choices or bad ones, now face your consequences and responsibilities. The free roam scenario is one of the best issues here, you can climb, jump and see all the city, destroy everything. I wished i could rate it 6 stars, completly worth it, a must have game.-"
45706,5,The Jet Li game of all time. Great seller!
52827,5,great games

286835,5,"I'm not going to go into detail. I never owned the Onza, and started using this over the Original controller. And my skill received a boost, specially on multiplayer fps games.  A must if you are competitive.  I've had it for several months and it still works like new."
22298,5,"Crazy Taxi is a very fun take on the typical driving-type game.  Fairly easy to control, fairly simple to master, this game is fun, fun, fun!  You choose one of four taxi-driver characters and start picking passengers up and delivering them to their destinations.  Don't worry if other cars are in your way, just bump into them, or better yet, launch yourself off a ramp to get ahead of them (or, if you think it might get you there quicker, try driving underwater or over grass).  The punk sound track adds to the frenetic race to get people where they want to go in a San Francisco-like environment complete with recognizable retail stores (Levi-Strauss, Tower Records, KFC... hmm, product placement?).
Crazy Taxi includes several play modes that have different rules, depending on which you choose.  There is also a training/practice mode that is quite challenging.
Parents of young kids: some of the passengers are verbally abusive if you don't get them where they want to go, and some cursing can be heard."
299500,5,Xbox live is a fantastic service and one I highly recommend for everyone.  PS may offer a free service...but this just works.
442135,5,"This remote is very easy to use. There was no setup required. It was simply point-and-click.  I am able to start, shutdown, and login to my Xbox using the remote.

I would recommend this remote to anybody with an Xbox One or Xbox One S and use it for media."
440255,5,Minecraft + JRPG = sign me up.  I like that there are different chapters AKA places to explore and build in. A good range of items. Lovable characters. Very casual and fun.
417222,5,"Really cool.  Very comfortable mouse - tracks extremely well.  Good weighting.  The LED under lighting around the edges is a nice touch.  Very, very cool to look at.  The surface is very large, so that is great for gaming, but - if your desk space is tight, it probably won't fit."
104540,5,"This is probably one of the most awesome games that I have ever played.

Pros:
The game play is awesome, the graphics are great, the silent assassinations are also really cool.

Cons:
The downsides are that after a while jumping off of building can get a little lame especially when there are so many view points. And also its the same thing over and over (pick pocket, interrogate, eavesdrop) and finishing all the investigations can take a long time. I think at one point I calculated that to just finishing one missing (jumping off of all the viewpoints, rescuing all the citizens, and doing all the investigations and assassinate the person) took me almost 3 hours. And it sucks that it is the same thing over and over. Also another downside is that when you are traveling at first to the different cities (which are far as hell you have to blend while passing soldiers or they attack you)

Would I recommend this game to anyone? Yes, but just be warned that it can get lame after a while which is why on my review I rated the game a 5 but the fun level a 3."
482804,5,"My nieces loves this character. Cute, fun little guy with a run that resembles a slip and slide..it's pretty funny."
34483,5,"When you hear of Square most likely you're gonna think of it's huge releases like Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, Xenogears and obviously all 10, yes count them 10 Final Fantasies(unless you include side story ones like Tactics.) And when you think Disney, you're gonna think kids stuff, first and foremost. So what was the reception when Square announced they paired with Disney to make a RPG? [...] But I seriously recommend you play it regardless of your feelings for Goofy and Donald.
Story: The story starts off with Sora and a lot of his friends(including 3 from Final Fantasy) stranded on an island. One day, beings known as the Heartless descend and the group is seperated. In the Disney universe, King Mickey has disappeared and tells Donald and Goofy to search for the one with the ""key"" and Sora and the Disney characters get tangled up in a big plot. Great story that has a dark tone even with Disney and Square characters.
Graphics: What great graphics and even capturing the worlds of Disney such as 100 Acre Woods(Winnie the Pooh)Halloween Town(Nightmare Before Christmas) and the jungle(Tarzan). And it's so nice to see you interact with Final Fantasy characters and Disney in the same screen.
Sound: With Disney they always had memorable voices play their characters and hear they are authentic too(save for a couple). The music is great and fits each scene great. The only thing you might complain about is that most voices from the really old movies like Peter Pan and Sleeping Beauty don't have their original voices but it's no big deal.
Gameplay: Hm...well playing the game is quite fun there's just one problem: the battle system. Basically you move the character with the Analog stick and the D-Pad for the menu. And it's all real-time too so if you're running out of health and need a potion fast, you can't just stop and take it or they'll get you. And that annoying camera. It often gets obstructed.
Even if this includes Disney characters you should play it anyway cause it's a really fun game with one of the best pairings in gaming."
85083,5,This game is the best the Xbox360 has to offer right now. Forget about Halo 3. Forget about Bioshock. This is a must have. This game is the only reason why I got a 360.
412047,5,"Best Starfox game in years.  Don't believe the naysayers.  Give yourself some time to get used to the controls, and this game is a blast."
102739,5,"Great controllers, best controller system on any Nexy gen system, but they break a little to easy.  When I opened the packing of my first one, it fell on the floor falling probally 2 feet and the trigger button wouldn't work, plus they are as any controller on any next-gen system way to expencive."
399270,5,"After what I would call a few misses for the AC series, Assassin's Creed Syndicate brings the game back in line to greatness.

The graphics are top notch, and the game again allows you to be as stealthy as you want to be, or take the more ""hack and slash"" approach of some of the RPG's take.

Although I've only been on it for a few hours, it has grabbed my attention (more than I can say for the last few in the series"" and makes me want to keep coming back for more.

I like the ability to play as additional characters, with separate abilities and movement...that only adds to the desire to keep coming back.

And then there is the rope/zip line aspect...I'll let you enjoy that one on your own."

194722,5,"For all those people who complained the lack of the old RPG style in Final fantasy 13, here comes Nier to give you what you need;

It has towns with shops and a lot of people whom you can talk to and enjoy the company.
It has Japanese-Manga style characters.
It has a great Sound track, which is an essential to any RPG.
It has side-Quests, which we should fill your day aside from the real nicely written story.

In conclusion, I must say that I have always enjoyed RPG games since Sorcerian and Zeliard, and this game is a great game for us RPG fans."

363477,5,Action-adventure junkies will love this game. Wasn't a fan of the previous Lara croft games until Tomb Raider for 360 was released. Rise of the tomb raider is a one of best games of 2015. Graphics are great at 60 fps that it blows your mind. Gameplay overall is challenging but even at the hardest setting the game is still playable.
375317,5,My favorite video game of the year so far. I binge played this I'm so sad I played it all already
367418,5,Really simple and excellent product. Literally just attach a little clip to the controllers and you're all set up. Just set your controller down on the base from there on out and it's always charged.
86308,5,"Tenkaichi 2 did the best job of capturing the story of Dragon Ball Z. With a staggering array of playable characters, an item system that in my opinion outclasses the one in Tenkaichi 3, and balanced gameplay, Tenkaichi 2 is a no brainer for dbz fans."
21889,5,"Long considered the Holy Grail of all Bosses in any NES game, Mike Tyson is the toughest to defeat, and anyone's status as a gamer elevates once he has beaten the archnemesis. At least that's how I felt when I finally beat Mike Tyson for the first time in my life after so many painstaking tries. I remember in the 80's that the popular saying was, ""Mike Tyson is so hard that Mike Tyson himself can't beat him."" That's the reason why Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! remains one of the greatest NES games in the history. The game takes a lot of strategy, great timing, and superb reflexes. Once in a while, there is luck involved. As a kid, the farthest I got was Bald Bull II. Recently, now after picking the game up after so many years of absence, I finally got past him with ease and began to view Mr. Sandman and Super Macho Man with a greater challenge. Eventually, with many practice, they both got easier for me. Finally, the ultimate challenge had arrived for me. It would prove my standing as the ultimate gamer. I was determined to beat Mike Tyson no matter what, no matter how long it took, and no matter how hard it was going to be. After a few hours one day and then an hour the next day, I had tasted the sweet taste of victory. I was very glad to have beaten everybody in the game.

Just a few side notes about the game. Mike Tyson, I believe, has never played the game before. Ever notice that when Glass Joe raises his arm up, his eye becomes weirdly out of place? I've always felt that Doc is the most useless trainer I've seen, and he just keeps saying absolutely irrelevant things during breaks. At one point, Mac says, ""Help! Help!"" Then he answers him back with, ""Join the Nintendo Fun Club today!"" What the hell...thanks for the pep talk, NOT. Speaking of Mac's whiny complaints, every time he thinks that he can't win the fight or whatever, I end up winning it for him. Just a pitiful attitude. Finally, now answer me this...how is it possible for a 103 pound weakling to get back up after being landed by one of Mike Tyson's punches of death? That should have sent Mac either to coma or death. Why do you think the 200 lb. fighters got knocked out silly by Mike Tyson during the 80's fights? Oh yes...one clue to how to get the health bar raised after a break between two rounds is to press the SELECT button repeatedly. Sometimes, it's useless because I only got so little of it. But it's better than nothing, I suppose. All in all, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! is a true NES classic and is one of the hardest games in NES history. Below are the strategies in how to beat the game. Check my youtube videos per stage by typing in ""Mr. Math Expert Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!,"" so you can see what I mean.

Piston Honda II Walkthrough: Password: 032 730 8442. He is just like the first Piston Honda but much easier. Just dodge his punches and counter them back. At 1:00, he steps back for a second and then come back in. Now, this is really important: this must be done simultaneously, not before or after. As soon as he is in the process of moving forward, belly punch him. He is out for good. If you fail to get it done, then try it again at 2:00. Otherwise, get the stars and star-punch him.

Soda/Vodka Popinski Walkthrough: A lot of players thinks Soda/Vodka Popinski is tough to beat. But really, he is a joke. The biggest reason why is because his punches are slow coming due to probably a freeze glitch. Just dodge and counter punch all the way through the match. Occasionally, maybe if you feel like it, you can cover your head up to block his short punches until he is ready to do the massive power punch. At that moment he is set up to do that, there is a freeze glitch, and when that happens, get back to normal stance and belly punch him. Then delay a bit before you dodge his another massive punch. Punch him in the head to grab the star once before you star-punch him. He gets knocked out flat no matter how much power he has. One problem with this strategy is that Vodka may occasionally dodge the star punches. So, it's not very reliable as the dodge-and-counter method which I prefer more.

Bald Bull II Walkthrough: Bald Bull II is perhaps the second challenger of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, but he is not that hard. In fact, he is a great warmup for reflex practice which is absolutely required for Mr. Sandman, Super Macho Man, and Mike Tyson. If not for Ball Bull 2, it gets hard later. Basically, he is no different from the previous Bald Bull: just dodge and counter. Once again, he does the Bull Charge, but this time, he has the long version and the short version. The former, always dodge it no matter what, and the latter, belly punch him on the third hop. Over time, Ball Bull II is pretty easy.

Don Flamenco II Walkthrough: Again the washed up version of Rocky Balboa. Don Flamenco II is a bit difficult to fight because of the timing of his punches, but when mastered, he is easy because he takes a while to knock Mac off. He displays three type of punches: the straight punch, the back hand punch, and the Flamenco oval punch. Once you understand how each works, he becomes a joke. Pretty much, it's dodge and counter all the way through.

Mr. Sandman Walkthrough: Mr. Sandman is the third challenger of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! but really the first real, formidable challenger of the game. This is purely all about superb reflexes. The first 7 to 10 punches he throws are very tough, so learn how to dodge them and throw only one face-jab. Afterwards, he switches over to a simple back hand punch. Make sure to jab him in the head before countering and belly-punching him three times. Keep doing it. The best part of him is his Dreamland punches. You start dodging them three times; the first time he starts flashing, you dodge it right after, not just exact instant it happens, but just right after. Then dodge left two more times as you get hang of it. Now...this is really important. Most people do not realize this. After the very third dodge, face-jab him once and then belly-punch him ten times.

Super Macho Man Walkthrough: Password: 267 853 7538. Super Macho Man is the second real, formidable opponent of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! In reality, he is just like Vodka Popinski except that he is quicker in his punches. Sometimes, he is pretty much wide that it doesn't really matter how well you dodge. Just dodge and counter. The small version takes 4 face-jabs while the big version takes 6 face-jabs. Now, for the Super Macho Spin which always happens right after you knock him out (it never occurs randomly), just like how you did with Mr. Sandman, watch for that flash and then dodge right after that, never at the exact instant as it happens. While you are dodging his punches, do it rhythmically...not pressing LEFT rapidly and hard as you can which is a mistake. Just do it rhythmically every time you see his back turned around and then again and again. Then, face-punch him after it's all over.

Mike Tyson Walkthrough
Password: 007 373 5963

Finally, at this point, you will start feeling that everybody else is pretty easy compared to Mike Tyson. Really, he just has no equal. This is the ultimate challenge of the game. This fight took me a lot of tries to master...after losing to him and going to the Reset button and typing in the password over and over. It was a lot of work although building up a lot of annoyance and anger at the same time. Pretty much the key of the game is superb reflexes in the first 90 seconds. As soon as you see the flash, dodge fast and then hit him in the face fast. Listen, this is important...it takes practice and dedication. If he hits you on right side, hit him in the face right side and vice versa. I say this because if you do it wrong way, the damage is minimal. Now, right after the first punch, delay (and always keep holding the UP button in the entire time) a bit before you throw him a face punch. You will realize that these two punches will do more damage than a simple two quick jabs to the face. Keep trying that method until you have mastered it. It took me a while even though I had a hard time believing in it, but it will WORK. Remember...match his first side punch and then delay a bit before another face punch. Your number one goal in here is to limit yourself to one knockout (zero can be greatly accomplished, but it's an endurance match) of Mac. Get knocked out more than one time, you don't stand a chance of winning. Finally, after the 90 second brutal display of punches of death, Mike gives up and starts throwing the same repeated pattern of punches. Look for the blink of his eye and then dodge and counter. At this point, you should knock him out once by 2:40 although I recommend keeping his power bar to the bare minimum to the end of first round without knocking him out (it doesn't really matter at this point; what is important is surviving the first 90 seconds with one knockout or less; once done, you are pretty much in the clear for the rest of the way).

Now, as soon as second round starts, your biggest challenge is dodging his first ten super fast punches. Don't even think about countering back on any of them. As soon as he gives up, he reverts back to the same old tired routine from the second half of the first round with occasional punch of death (but this time, less damaging). He gets easier to work with, and you should be able to knock him out more often. At this point, you should be able to grab a star from time to time with a delay punch; I am not sure how it works, but they do come nevertheless. They are valuable in terms of reducing his health bar, but the star punches just have to be timed at the right time. Finally, there is an odd pattern coming from Mike Tyson. Most of the time, I get frozen out because I wasn't sure what to think of. Honestly, this is the greatest chance of the entire match to knock him out right away. As soon as he starts blinking both eyes, star-punch him in the face immediately to knock him out for the second time. As soon as he comes out, it's a race to third knockout before the bell rings. Keep up your patience, and don't lose your form. It's not over yet, and don't celebrate yet; just keep at it before you finally get it. If you get to third round, it is actually easier because Mike was never known for going the distance. Pretty much the best hope for a win is one knockout in first round, two knockouts in second round, and at least one knockout in third round to reach 5000 points to get a favorable decision."

366999,5,These controllers work perfect on my Mac computer and it was just plug and play. It's actually kinda shocking how close they are to the Sega 6 button controller which was always my favorite to use
221384,5,"What the hell are people talking about, I played ace combat 6, sure it's different but I love the difference, First thing I notice besides jets is you get to play in Apache/helicopter mode, you can zoom and stuff, some missions with night vision, you play in Dubai/Africa/Russia etc. The music is awesome, the jets are cool. The engage in combat mode is awesome. Alright if you like easy games then it's not for you because it takes a while to get used to the controllers, and skipping screen tips won't be of much help. Once you get the controllers down you will just enjoy it. My only complaint like someone said is that the allies don't help, maybe they are shooting off radar enemies, but everything on radar you will end up shooting yourself. So it's a challenging game because of it, I repeated some missions a couple of times, others were normal difficult, I love the apache controllers, flying over cargo ships, buildings, mountains, exploding air bombs, shooting cargo ships, and the realistic scenes.

by the time anyone reads this I'll probably been done with it, replay value for me is high, again it's hardcore, depends on your taste but's its definitely not as bad as some say here. Buy it rent it borrow it whatever it's GOOD peace"
163998,5,THIS IS A GOOD GAME. FUN FOR THE KIDS. OLDIE BUT GOODIE. WE HAVE FUN PLAYING IT ALL THE TIME
13951,5,"Okay, I had been having problems for over a year with my first, original ps2 - disc read errors, some dvd/games that wouldn't work, and frequent disassemblies to try to remedy the problems.

A couple of weeks ago, I finished with a ROUGH week of finals (senior in college) and wanted to get some games to celebrate.  I went Saturday morning the day after finals and bought Resident Evil 4 and Gran Turismo 4(the game I was really after).  I stick GT4 in, and the opening movie was going like 1 frame every 10 seconds and the disc was making a bunch of noise.  So I figured I had to take it apart again and readjust the white dial that changes the lens height because it wasn't able to read the disc properly.  The top cover of the playstation slid off my desk while I was working on it and pulled the power/reset ribbon cable out of the socket - so I had to fiddle a while to get that back in.  Then, the controller/memory ribbon cable came out of the socket, and I fiddled with that for a while and could never make it go back in.

Finally, I said SCREW trying to fix this, I'm getting another playstation.  Although, I didn't drive back out that weekend to get another one, so I had two new games just sitting there doing nothing until Monday afternoon after work.  Surprisingly, I had to look at 3 different stores before I found a slim Ps2.

I've been using it for about a week, and I LOVE IT.  It plays all my games, DVDs, its quiet (no noisy PSU fan anymore), I think it seems to load games slightly faster, AND it has a built-in IR sensor - I hadn't heard anyone mention that in all the reviews I read, but this is a GREAT feature - you don't need that bulky thing that takes up a controller slot anymore to use your DVD remote - and you don't have to reconfigure anything. Oh, AND it has a built in network adapter - I'm glad I didn't waste money on one for my old ps2.  Also, I set up the network adapter with zero difficulty.

I've heard the top-loading disc tray being considered a disadvantage.  I disagree.  Less moving parts - less possibility of malfunction!  The lens is exposed for easy cleaning (or damage, so be careful).  I think this design works for longer - just look at how long portable CD players work vs. bulky stereos that have ejecting cd trays.  My past stereos always skipped during songs or wouldn't play it all, but he ol' discman always worked better.

Also, no hard drive capability.  From what I've heard, the hard drive is really only having if you want to play FFXI, but that game costs like $12 a month or something and I've heard it's not that much fun anyway.

One other thing, I think I've read that the slim ps2's are difficult/impossible to mod.  Not an issue for me, but maybe that would bother some people.

I love this thing!!!"
210516,5,"This game is best compared to Bioshock, where you enter the aftermath of a civil war and slowly unravel what happened.

The sand is very much like the water in Bioshock.

I also liked the characters more. They were more realistic and believable.

The city is gorgeous. It is one of the best video game environments I've ever seen. One of the most creative too.

The bad: the gameplay. The guns feel weird, like they're too light and they're practically squirt guns. You don't get a sense of a real *thump* coming from the guns. this is probably mostly sound design, but it is lacking.

The cover system works but I too often popped out of cover because I hadn't taken into account my perspective in relation to the wall, so I moved away and out of cover.

So the guns could use improvement. But the other aspects of the game were very enjoyable.

I think maximum enjoyment of this game would come if you went in expecting a Call of Duty or Battlefield 3 esque clone, and instead was exposed to this take.

This is the best story-driven game I've ever played."
448837,5,"Phantasy Star 2 is a very, very good RPG from heyday of the Sega Genesis/Super Nintendo era.  It is probably the strongest of the four Phantasy Star games.  The music score is excellent, and the graphics are decent.  The strongest part of this game is probably its storyline, which is both compelling and mature.  There is no ""let's beat the master archfiend"" or ""let's rescue the princess"" in this game.  PS2 has a futuristic/sci-fi setting, rather than a medieval castle-type setting.  Your mission is to find out why biomonsters are wreaking havoc on your world when the computer system that supposedly provides for all of the world's citizens' needs is supposed to prevent such outbreaks.

Thus, your journey begins.

Let it be known that this is an old-school RPG.  It features a lot of random battles which are all turn-based.  The battle engine has some strengths in that you can choose the ""FGHT"" command which will let you fight on autopilot until you intervene.  Or for more difficult battles, you can choose the ""STGY"" command to use items, cast spells, or defend.  One weakness of the battle engine is that the only way to know how much damage you sustain from the enemies is to watch your own HP level.  This leads to a few incidents of being wiped out by an enemy that can use mass attacks and you don't not even know it until it's too late.  (Blasters, I'm looking at YOU.)

This game features about 20 dungeons on two different planets.  Many of these dungeons are HUGE and COMPLEX.  It is STRONGLY recommended that you either make your own maps or download some maps from elsewhere because you will NOT be able to just randomly bungle your way through these places like you could in a Final Fantasy game.  Even the very first dungeon can be difficult to navigate.

There are also 8 playable characters in this game.  You can have up to 4 in your party at any given time.  Each character has his or her own unique ability.  Some are great fighters.  Some are better with magic.  And some are better depending on whether you're fighting a biomonster or a robot.  So there's a bit of strategy involved here; not everybody can learn every spell or equip every weapon.  Also, you cannot breeze through this game by overleveling because there is a cap on how high you can go.

One flaw with this game is the fact that you will have to do A LOT of grinding.  Equipment upgrades are expensive, and when you are buying equipment for 8 warriors, that gets pricey fast.  Also, as you gain companions, they will all start at Level 1.  So you often have to build up their strength before moving on to the next town or dungeon.  That causes a break in the action.  While that may slow things down a bit, it's probably necessary because you will have a hard time advancing in this game with inferior equipment and being underleveled.

This, however, is a minor quibble.  If you are patient, this game will reward you with an incredible gaming experience.  There's not much flashy about it in terms of cut scenes, animations, and voiceovers.  But the gameplay is definitely solid and the storyline is very well thought out.  Again, be advised that this is not a game for people who are new to RPGs or who like their RPGs on the easy side.  Some of the dungeons in this place are downright cruel.  If you don't mind a challenge, then get your graph paper ready and prepare to be amazed."

The cut off man is really easy to hit this year. You can now pitch from the pitcher mounds view and to my surprise this works very well. the graphics are the best out of all the new baseball games and the controls are second to none. If you are looking for the best baseball game on any system this is the one. You won't go wrong with WSB 2k3.

196208,5,"Pros:
Different styles for different people.
For instance I LOVE Asain style clothes! This game has a fictional brand called Karamomo that suits my taste perfectly. LOL  I actually have stuff that looks like the Karamomo brand.

You can customize your shop to an extent. You can choose the background and music. But you can't pick things like shelves and racks.

You can customize your avatar.
You can't blend/smuge the eye shadow colors together.
Cons
 You have to hold the DS like book. That makes using the button controls awkward.
NO guy models/customers. The sequel does have them.

Graphics and sound, are not bad but the sequel is much better in this reguard.

There aren't many choices for accessories. NO hand bags, umbrellas/parasols or wallets.

I'm updating my review because of the negative reviews some have posted.

'Skimpy' clothes.  The key to wearing this stuff properly is to use them in LAYERS!  Example: Short shorts/skirts need to be worn on top of tights, panty hose or leggings.
 Example 2: Tank tops need to be worn under sweaters or jackets.

OK moving on..

The 'negative' talk.
Customers come in and say that they hate their job.
This happens in real life. I happen to like that game designers put this in. If all the customers had 'perfect' lives, then this wouldn't be Style Savvy. It would be 'Superficial Surplus'.
Besides  there's ALOT more good stuff the girls do and say. Some are into sports, fitness, art, and photography ect.

One girl will even 'write' you a poem, if you make her happy and loyal customer.

If you're not too sure this game right for you kid, then try it out before she/he dose."
225775,5,"I own the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TrackMania-DS/dp/B001L10OS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TrackMania DS</a>&nbsp;and that led me to pick this one up, and I am not disappointed in the slightest. More track types, more variety, more space and pieces to work with in the builder, just more fun overall.

If you haven't played Trackmania before, like me before I tried the DS one, the controls will be frustrating at first, but you'll get used to them soon. It's not a racing game necessarily, but more like a racing platformer. I love racing games, which is why I got the DS version, but I love this game for other reasons. The races are short, so it's easy to just keep trying to get the gold, and easy to say to yourself, ""Just one more track..."" Then there's Platform races, where they don't time you, but they count your restarts. Finally there's the track builder, which means, yes, you get to build the biggest jump of all time.

Usually the pitfall of racing games is the monotony. Somehow Trackmania manages to keep every race fresh and different even with hundreds of tracks using the same set of pieces.

Totally worth it. I think I'll have to pick up Build to Race for the DS now so I can play and build anywhere."

It's sounds cliche, but this is what an FPS should be like-good graphics, good controls, very good weapons, pretty good story, very good AI (your squad this time takes care of most of the enemies for you if you move too slow), a nice variety of missions, and excellent mutilplayer games out of the box. My only two complaints:

1. Like everyone else I think the single player is much too short. A game as great as this, you want at least 20 or 30 hours.

2. No quicksave! Please, all you game publishers out there, stop with the ""checkpoints"" and give us quicksave again!

Other than those two things this game is a classic. One of the few I would recommend buying outright especially if you are into on line play."
18612,5,"This game is even more awsome and more bad @$$ than Double Impact and Alpha 3, infact, it's way past Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes and Capcom Vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millenium 2001(it's top of my list in other words). They had nothing to improve but over-all sound FX and music, so they figured lets make better music for everones stages and improve over-all sound FX, and they did. Akuma(Gouki) is no longer a secret character, but Shin Gouki is(YES, THAT'S RIGHT I SAID SHIN GOUKI), and they have 6 new characters: Twelve, who like Shang Tsung from the Mortal Kombat series, can change into all of the characters in the game, including Gill.  Speaking of Gill, Remmy is also one of the 6 new characters very similar to Charli and Guile, more to Charli, reason being is one of his Super-Arts, it is Charli's from the Marvel/Capcom Vs. series.  The last four characters are Q whom identity of is a secret, even to the CIA(it might not even be human), Makoto, the 2nd Ryu wannabe, but with a style less like the shotokan style of that belonging to Ryu Ken and Gouki, Shin Gouki(as said above), and last but not least....... Chun-Li, with a new look and style, described by GameSpot as more similar to Tai-Chi.  The soundtrack to the game rules, the rap songs are freaking awsome, have a slick beat, and they make you want to get up and break dance in the middle of the game(seriously, I can break dance and if I could I would just from some of the beats of this game, not all of them but some, not all are hip-hop based music, some jazz type and a little rock, that's what rule about this game, so much diverstiy with everything). It is a very impressive 2-D game, hell, it is the most impressive 2-D fighter ever.  One of the best features is that you can choose your opponent for the next match out of 2 characters and no matter which of the two characters you choose for your next bout, they tie in perfectly to the story line for your character.  Better than that, they kept the parry, introduced in the 1st SFIII game(also featured in Capcom Vs. SNK 2 available in P-Groove), it is my favorite feature of this game, if you don't know what parrying is, you basicly perform a ""quick-block"" much like that of the Alpha-Counter intorduced in the Alpha series.  You basicly tap forward(for a high and medium attacks) or down(for low and air attacks) just before the move hits, you take no damage, and if your opponent hits you with an attack that he or she phisicaly touches you with(a punch or kick move, not a projectile) it leaves the opponent ""frozen"" if you will, for any and every attack available for a very short period of time, but enough to pull off whatever is in your arsinal of attacks, but it doesn't freez opponents who throw projectiles(as said above), so basicly, you can parry a fireball, but it won't ""freez"" the opponent.  Best of all, you can parry multiple hits consecutively(like all hits of Ryu's Shinkuu Hadouken, one by one, but you have to parry as many times as their are hits, like if their is a 12 hit move/combo, you have to tap forward or down 12 seperate times, but you take no damage for any of the hits you have parried).  The modes are an excellent feature to this game, and the 20 characters rule(finally the roster is fairly sizable for a STREET FIGHTER III game, 21 if you count Giil, but he's not playable, sorry all you Gill players).  So if you are a true Street Fighter Fan(like myself) and want a real game, than what are you waiting for, buy this game now.  My only dissapointment for this game, is it is the last of the the Street Fighter series, but I wouldn't have it any other way, because CAPCOM ended it's terrific series with a huge bang!"

3) You can no longer hold an item behind you and pick up a new one.

The new tracks are amazing, anti-gravity is amazing. If you liked any previous version, get this. You'll love it.

Even long after you've done every mission in the game, it's still fun to just go around and cause havoc.  The atmosphere of Vice City really looks like it takes a step back in time, to a idealized beach that you can only see on TV reruns.  One of the best games I've ever played, and its only drawback is that it seems excessively violent to me."

The crisp graphics make the town come alive better than ever. Silent Hill 2 is one of (if not the) best game in the series and it's great that it has been treated so well in this remake. The rerecorded dialogue also makes the games more engrossing and fun, it's great that Konami took the time to do that.

I wouldn't say there are any true cons but more of a barrier to entry for gamers new to the series - and that would be the controls. If you haven't played the original Resident Evil (or Silent Hill) games you're going to be in for a bit of a shock when you play these. It's the classic tank controls where you spin then move. It was always kind of weird but when that's all there was, well, you dealt with it. Luckily they've included an option where the character will move in the direction the control is pointed. I highly suggest this if you're not going to go for the true classic feel.

Also, Silent Hill 2 includes the original dialogue as well, so you can really see the work that Konami has put into the game. I've always been a huge Silent Hill fan and the oppressive fog of the game plays off the great new textures very well. Two great games for this price? Give it a shot!"

461569,5,"I can't wait to get this gem back. I've been trying to get it on PS2 for the past longest & decided not to wait anymore. Showing my good old XBox more love, like the time I played & beat the story mode. I also love Arena mode to death! Any type of (on-going) survival mode is cool."

244589,5,"A key issue with the XBox Kinect is that it needs a large space to operate properly. With the XBox Zoom add-on device, you can now play in far less space. How does it work - and DOES it work?

First, let me explain what the device is. Photos make it seem like an entire Kinect system, but all it is is a clip-on that goes over the three lenses. So in the image you see, the Zoom part is ONLY the plastic raised clip area that is over the three lenses. In essence it's putting ""glasses"" on your Kinect system, so the lenses see more close up.

This means that those Zoom lenses MUST BE PERFECTLY CLEAN. If there are any smudges, or fingerprints, or anything else on those lenses, it is going to greatly distort the image the Kinect sees and make the games not read your motions well.

The Zoom comes with a think plastic protective shield - make sure you pop out the three circle areas that would go over the lenses. You want nothing at all between the Kinect's lenses and the Zoom's lenses and your body.

When we first put the Zoom onto our Kinect, there was a ""ghosting"" effect around our body. Apparently we hadn't had it seated quite right. Once we removed it and re-seated it, the ghosting went away completely.

I loaded a photo onto Amazon so you can see what the positioning difference is. You can see it by scrolling up, looking at the main image in the top left, and then clicking through the options for alternate images. Mine is the side by side avatar image. The image on the left is my ""avatar"" in a normal Kinect game. On the right is the exact same game, from the exact same location, but now with the Zoom installed. You can even see that I'm holding the camera up. So there's no ghosting or other issues, and the character is definitely much more centered within the available space.

I tried a set of games without and then with the Zoom. I got the same scores in the game either way. So my performance wasn't negatively impacted by the Zoom addition. My moves on screen seemed as smooth in either situation.

A key here is that the Zoom requires the optics to be perfectly clean and flawless. It could be that your Zoom unit has gotten dirty or smudged if it's not working. It could be that it's not aligned exactly perfectly with the Kinect's lenses. It could also be that you got a Zoom unit that had inherent flaws in its lenses.

However, it seems if you get a good Zoom unit, and then take care of the lenses properly, that it can be a godsend for people like me who only have 8 feet of space to work with in the living room.

We have our Kinect located beneath our TV.

Rating: 10/10 for me.

I purchased my Zoom with my own funds."
3668,5,still the top of its design
377735,5,"Works well, so much better than having to mess with the stupid wire. Unfortunately the system can't be lifted out without having to hold the unit down otherwise you'll lift the whole thing up along with the 3DS. Of course it's pretty much Nintendo's policy to not make things work completely right the way they should so it's to be expected at this point. It's a small price to pay for the convenience of a cradle. The original 3DS cradle was much better though, all you had to do was lay the 3DS in. That was perfect. Only other downside to the New 3DS cradle is that it's quite stupid looking having the 3DS stand up like that when it's in the cradle, but it's better than nothing. At least it works."

287338,5,"For enjoying the beating so much!

Brutal.  Just Brutal.  Even on the easiest setting, the new creatures that await you on Bitterblack Isle will make the Boss Dragon seem like a hob goblin in comparison.  Although Ive never been one to rush through a game, I found myself slowing down even more to observe my surroundings before haphazardly turning some dark corner or entering a new room.  There was a real sense of dread, wondering what kind of new monstrosity awaited my team, or if my lantern would go out leaving me swinging blindly in the dark at whatever horrible thing was pounding me into the ground. I learned quickly that racing for the exit ( and leaving my witless pawns behind as bait) was an actual survival tactic when mobbed by two Gore Cyclopes, three Sirens and a Wyrm all trying to end my painstaking progress, AT THE SAME TIME.

Really, Capcom?!?!

For me, I enjoy a good challenge so long as it isn't so frustrating that the game loses all its fun. This is where DD: Dark Arisen gets it right.  While Im inclined to compare Dark Arisen with Dark Souls, I enjoyed  Dragons Dogma more because there was an actual sense of accomplishment after surviving an ordeal.  Its dark, without being too depressing or drab.  Its challenging enough to make you want to continue playing without aggravating you to the point of giving up.  The graphics, story and gameplay were also more appealing (to me).  The added bonus is the ability to fully customize your own character and that of your companion (pawn) in order to play as whoever and whatever you like. A feature Ive always preferred in RPGs with the good sense to accommodate a broader audience.

Having already purchased and played the first release of Dragons Dogma, I found the expanded version was well worth the price given all the extra content and added gameplay hours it includes.  As a die-hard completest, Ive already spent an additional 40 hours in the new area alone, and still haven't finished all the new quests made available.  Add to that the high replay value of this game, and at $40.00, its still a bargain!"

72826,5,"I purchased this through my credit card's reward points.

Overall, I'm left wondering if the hard plastic case is easier temp wise, but with a rubber casing and storage for UMDs all at once, this one's really not a bad deal. I use it with my PSP 3000, and I plan to keep it. I left it open in the car on my way to town, since it was really hot. I don't know how wise it is to have a PSP out in hot weather, probably not so much, but it still works.

Like other reviews here, it pretty much holds up to what even the product info says. I hold four UMDs in the looser pocket, and you're given an extra two individual pockets on a flap that in effect, covers and protects the screen while closed. The two individual pockets may hold memory cards, but as easy as the UMDs can fall out when you open it, it's probably better to leave the extra cards at home, who knows, maybe you can decide for yourself, but I haven't tried it yet to see...:[ Good case, worth the money, if you can buy cheap go for it.

While the fancy hard plastic case by Sony is flashy and whatever, this one is not, for good reason: it's discreet."

178199,5,"Ever since the days of Knights of the Old Republic, I have been with Bioware. They have created some of the most memorable RPG's in history. Their mastery of storytelling is unparalleled. Along with KOTOR, Jade Empire, and Mass Effect (my personal favorite), Dragon Age: Origins stand amongst the greatest RPG's in recent memory. The only thing that could possibly be considered bad about this game, isn't really that bad at all. Dragon Age has been in development since late 2004. Compared to most games these days, it's graphically limited. It still looks beautiful but it's development time cost it the graphical prowress present in modern day videogames. It's not bad looking, just about a year behind. But it will not bother you and those of you who aren't graphic whores like myself, you won't even notice it. The gameplay, combat, sound, graphics, and ecspecially story, are all superb.

All I have to say is this... Bioware, you've done it again! Purchase Dragon Age: Origins without hesitation."

199760,5,"Review for Heavy Rain (ps3):

Hello all! First off, I would like to start by stating the impact this game had on me upon finishing it. Let me put it like this; I have never played a game as great as this since the legendary Xbox title star wars KOTOR. In fact, having rented this game and finishing it days later, I have already purchased it off of Amazon (to support the developers) and am recommending the game to all my PSN friends! I rarely do that with a game. But a game of this caliber deserves a good, detailed review honoring the developers who created such a groundbreaking game. Unfortunately, you constantly have to keep reminding yourself of that though as you progress through the storylines...its still a game.

So I am going to start off by explaining how this game is so different from the others today. First of all, you should know that this game utilizes time-sensitive controls. Meaning that all the features of the controller will be used in some combination to perform tasks and/or simple actions. For example, to walk across the room and open the fridge door... hold R2 (walking to the fridge) and then use the R stick to make a half circle movement (to open the fridge door). This style of game play, though tedious to some becomes 2nd nature after 5 minutes and is a constant enjoyment throughout the game! In my opinion, this makes the player more INVOLVED in the game.

 I kind of like to relate the story line *structure of the game like the well-known The Sims games. You perform rather life-like rituals and actions that help get the story going at first (you won't be making coffee every single morning in the game. lol) but just involved enough, so that you form a close enough relationship to the character(s).  In addition to what makes this game realistically stunning is the ability to see/hear what your character is thinking of (which changes realistically to any new situation). That is an unheard of feature for any video game! It is tied into the plot to help you most often, so don't be turned off from that feature. Some people have made reference to the classic arcade game Dragon Lair, and I can only attest to the part about the sequential button/arrow combos, which is a looot, more detailed and diverse in Heavy Rain. As you will see in the game, simple actions and fight scenes (as well as love scenes) involve just more that simple button combinations. How you press the buttons, how long you press the buttons, as well as with how many other buttons/control sticks- all have a part in the game play. It makes for a really satisfying experience though.

Graphics are by far the best I have seen in a non-fps shooter title. Several times in the game, I have become soo immersed in the fluidity and natural integration of game play and the supposed `cut scenes' (supposed because a cut scene defines a non-playable scene from a playable one). So its really saying something when the majority of a game is so visually stunning that it makes the player feel like he/she is the director to his own thriller/murder mystery movie. How many games do you or I know of that have that much capability?? None that come to mind. Sure, many that are 3D worthy, but none quite so astounding to the point where you think you're watching an in-theater movie. Details are EVERY WHERE!! And the environment is so interactive with the character; you'll find yourself wanting to stray from the objective just to explore. (Note: I DO NOT mean this as in FALLOUT or OBLIVION exploring! Way too big.) :P But impeccable attention to detail and functionality. I would also like to mention that each small action has its own genuine sound effect. The cracking of an egg, raindrops, ambient sound, etc.- all have their own non-generic sounds. Furthermore, QuanticDream has gone the next step and used real actors (not self-claimed) to perform the dialogue. They are even strapped with movement sensors that provide real-time information to the computers so that basic human (gender-specific too) positions and functions are carried out to the last detail. The female character has a certain sway in the hips when she walks and a certain type of posterior/abdominal characteristics than the stiff, pencil-neck male counterpart who's beard gets thicker and thicker as the days go by. My point is movement that needs to be captured is captured- but with painstaking detail and live human modeling. To put it into perspective, they used the same method that Peter Jackson used to create Golem (for fans of Lord Of The Rings)- an actor in a sensor-studded suit, playing the role of the slimy creature.

Unfortunately, there are many negative reviews about the graphics issues when they played on their ps3s for 10+ hours. I can't believe I have to state this, but of course your ps3 may start to skip and/or freeze after 10 HOURS OF NON STOP USE! This is a very demanding game and there is no inadequacy on the game disc or stations' part. Simply put, the ps3 is an efficient gaming console- not a super computer made by Alienware that has internal liquid cooling tubes and 4x 120mm fans scattered around. Come on. So, yes the locking/freezing issue is a problem with the owner's handling. If you encounter problems where pixilation distortion occurs or color range is way off, or for any bugginess at all, then just restart the console before resorting to deleting and re-installing.

The storyline is really as indulging as it is masterful! The writers of the plot composed it so that there are a myriad of endings, climaxes and paths for the four different characters! Similar to...Bioshock, Kotor, Mass Effect, Alpha Protocol, Far Cry and other RPG titles that insisted on choice as the dominant factor that the game, Heavy Rain does not disappoint in this section. In fact it over exceeded my expectations and thoroughly surprised me! In fact its like my earlier example, imagine you're in a theater watching a movie and you decide, ""I don't want him to die"" or  ""well he's not important, he can suffer from a heart attack"" and it happens like that! It's all about the choices you make however small! There is no karma system like a few of the rpg games mentioned above. It is simply irrelevant to the game play. The murder can actually remain unsolved even and you will still be able to finish the game!!! That's how wide open the possibilities are!

An extremely well made game that will have you on the edge of your seat wanting to replay it over and over again.  I highly recommend this game to those wanting a break from the barrage of fps shooters out there and just see how far the RPG industry has come! Thank you for staying with me thus far. Hope this helps you!"
193494,5,"In 2005, I started playing the first Metroid Prime installment and beat it in over 2 months.  I'm now working on the second and third installments.  There are some obvious differences between the controls, though -- on the first 2 titles, you had to use the clunky Nintendo GameCube controller to move, scan, aim, and kill large, vast amounts of enemies/bosses.  Fortunately, Nintendo corrected that problem with Metroid Prime 3:  Corruption; you could use the Wii remote to move around while holding down the Z button with the Nunchuk to scan everything you find in sight.  Then you could use the C button to transform into the Morph Ball.  Yes, it made life much easier.  :)

With Metroid Prime Trilogy, Nintendo ultimately decided to make ALL three games Wii Remote/Nunchuk exclusive; in other words, you can now play the game the way that it's MEANT to be played!  Overall, the graphics, sound effects, locales and the dark soundtrack make the player feel as if they've really been transported to a distant planet.  And what's even better, when you get attacked by enemies, bugs, or drenched by rain, I truly love how realistic it looks on Samus's visor.  Just one important note as you progress throughout each game:  scan, scan, and scan some MORE.  It might just help you out of a tight jam!!

Please correct me if this is inaccurate, but there was just one minor detail that I noticed whenever you start each game -- ""prime"" example, too -- if you started playing Metroid Prime 1, it would pull you right into the storyline without showing the original title screen that you saw when playing the Nintendo GameCube version.  You would have the same issue with MP 2 and 3.  However, if you're willing to overlook that, it's still an awesome trilogy that's worth the 50 bucks out of your wallet.

So, in a nutshell, for those of you that are Metroid vets, there is no excuse for you NOT to purchase this game.  :)"
367455,5,Works great.
457558,5,very happy with it
257055,5,What a great title completely surprised me I never expected it to be so good from the story to the game play to the graphics. The Undead Redemption is icing on the cake and basically like getting two games in one. I would recommend this game to anyone thinking about buying it.
194749,5,"I had originally purchased this game through the playstation network, and took advantage of the upgrade campaign to transfer that license to the playstation 4 before that campaign ended last month (March 2015).  That license transfer meant that I no longer had a playstation 3 license.  Purchasing this hard copy of the game got me an activation code which could be used to re-add the license to my account, so I can now play on either the playstation 3 or 4.  I have no intention of playing the PS3 version, and once the expansion comes out, that will be even less likely because the expansion needs to be purchased separately for each platform, but I bought this for two reasons; The first is that the PS4 is still relatively new, so it's hard to predict how reliable the hardware is going to be.  If the ps4 fails, I could play on the ps3 until the ps4 is repaired or replaced.  The second is that the license for this game came with an additional 30 day trial period, for roughly the cost of a month of basic service, so it's like getting another platform license free with a month of service."
98780,5,"Ive been playing games for a long time specifically FPS(first person shooters) I play a lot on xbox live games like battlefield two and rainbow six, and let me say that even though this game doesn't have multiplayer I am going to take a stab and say it is better than Half life 2. Wether you know half life 2 or not, it was a game that took home all the awards and I believe that BioShock will trounce it.

To start off if you haven't played the demo on xbox live, play it, and if thats not enough to convince you to go buy it right away, rent it, thats what I did, im on my second week renting it from blocbuster and im going to buy it. The games so huge and whats even cooler is you can go back at any time and take care of things you might have missed or to get things like ammo that you dodnt need then but you need now, yep it will still be there. I hate it when that perverbial door closes behind you and you cant go back to get something you were saving or maybe you just went the wrong way, but nope cant go back cause there is a door or a fence, but not in this game. It is so cool that when I went back to 2 levels ago that some machine gun rounds or a health kit was sitting right where I left it.

The graphics are the some of the best Ive seen in a shooter so far the lighting, the detail, just the whole original-ness of everthing is awesome, its not another ww2 shooter which they have really played out lately. Everything in this story, in this world is new and unexpected, the enemy is smart, you can grow your character make him stronger, you can upgrade your weapons, invent new items, you can hack security robots and make them work for you. One of the coolest things is that over time your character can evolve and gain new powers like telekenesis(moving objects by thought) which comes in very handy to like catch a grenade that an enemy is throwing at you and hurl it back at him, or grab those hard to reach powerups.

Theres lots of game for your buck like I said ive been playing for almost two weeks now and am still pretty far from beating the game, course I like to take my time, being a long time RPG(role playing game) player I like to find every little secret, and take in every little detail of the game, so that I can beat it right the first time.

Trust me ive been playing games since the atari and coleco vision era and I know games(pretty sad huh?) but if you buy it, rent it, whatever just play it; trust me you won't be dissapointed."
346162,5,"I loved this game! It was a great follow-up to the first one, but also a very different game. The camera, the fighting, the environments...all were much better. The story was also much more involved. I got about 20+ hours out of the game, but you could easily do longer. All the boss fights were manageable, with the exception of the last two being a bit more difficult. If you've never played the first game, I'd suggest doing it first. This story starts off from a radically different place than where the first one ended, but they do explain as they go along, tying it together. Well worth the purchase."
478286,5,"The seller didn't offer any instructions or information on how the part is to be installed, so when I took this little screen which was well packaged out of the envelope, I thought for a moment that I had been sent a cardboard fake. I had already taken the original screen lens off, and that's where some people may be confused as it's quite a balance between delicacy and force as you have to peel the old one off and yet be careful not to damage the actual screen underneath. Anyway, having realized that there is a protective film on the front and back to protect the screen, I carefully peeled back the side with the adhesive then fixed it to my GBASP screen by aligning it with one of the corners. It's good to keep a can of air and even wear protective gear before adding the screen lens as the tiniest bit of dust will be sealed for life inside the two parts. I also used pre-moistened eye glass cleaning tissues to clean the screen completely before installation. Once it was on I then peeled back the protective film from the outside of the screen and installed it all back into the shell. It's now as good as new but I feel sorry for anyone who isn't sure about what to do. I highly recommend watching some tutorials on basic shell replacement for the Gameboy Advance SP because it's rather daunting."
237504,5,Best family video game.
260413,5,I love the game and this mouse helps if the user is willing to play around with something new.  If they want to stick with their keyboard then I'd choose something different.
427530,5,"The guy who gave this a one star is just trolling. If you've never played this, keep in mind that it was originally a ps vita game. I recommend watching a few clips before purchasing but this game has a fan base for a reason."
415265,5,"Works fine, not much else to say about it. It works with the 3ds, 3ds xl, and 2ds"
377902,5,"Oh, I do love the Lego X game series. They've all been quite excellent, but this one really sets the new gold standard. Everything you love about the previous games is here (characters, comedy, collecting), but everything about it is improved.

Let's start with the plot. Brianiac pops up and plans to shrink the world, as he does. Meantime, the various different colored Lanterns pop up to do what they do. At the same time, Lex Luthor, the Joker, and others are scheming their way onto the Justice League Satellite of Love. Oh, and Hawkman is trapped in a gilded cage.

Got all that?

The controls for flying, especially, are vastly improved in this game game over Lego Batman 2. Like flying in the overworld areas is no longer a massive chore. Even better, you no longer have to look around for a changing station for Batman and Robin, as they can change into their alternate suits at a moment's notice. Further, you get to use the B button as a context button for various different tasks, including instantly changing into a different outfit.

That last point I cannot stress enough. It is so darn useful! It's nice to be able to swap on the fly without having to get taken out of the story.

Now I did see a reviewer who mentioned they had problems with their controller. I didn't have any problems with mine, except when I tried to do two-player with a friend and his controller wouldn't respond. A reboot of the game fixed that. For the record, I'm using a wired 360 controller.

Beyond that, there are about 175 unlockable characters, including Shazam (Captain Marvel), all the various Lanterns, Batmite, and several special surprises that I wouldn't dream of spoiling here. The number and variety of characters really shows how aware this game is of its history. In addition, you get stuff from the 1966 Batman TV series, you hear the Superman theme when Superman flies, and, happily, the Wonder Woman theme when Wonder Woman flies.

Really, I cannot think of a single problem with this game. I loved it completely, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
210801,5,it was really excellent!! i love it. this is what im looking for. now i can enjoy it! thank you.
150111,5,"Mafia 2 is another game tied into the popular sandbox genre for 2010 releases, developed by 2K's Czech studio. While games like Red Dead Redemption may seem hard to match with their high caliber story and gameplay, Mafia 2 is a game that is going to fly under the radar for most gamers. The game follows the protagonist, Vito Scaletta and begins in the early 1940's in the northeastern U.S. and spans across 12 years of his life. To highlight some of the games strong suites, it is evident that the developers focused on polishing the physics and story most. The game runs on NVIDIA physics, which really shines with fully destructible buildings and cover and fine details like the way Vito's suit naturally flows while he's running. Addressing the story, it's one of the best and deepest stories i've seen in a game since Uncharted 2. By the time the credits roll, you feel like you're saying goodbye to a couple of friends, not just a cast of bland and forgettable characters. Although there are some imperfections that hinder the overall quality of this game that are worth noting. One mentionable flaw is the aiming system, which is slightly flawed and generic and I felt like I didn't have as much accuracy as I should've had with a majority of the guns I used throughout the game. Another problem I had with the game was the cover system. There were several instances in the game when I would dig into cover and still take damage, which became somewhat frustrating. Although, I should mention that I was playing on hard difficulty, so on lower difficulties it may not be as much of an issue. Overall, I would highly recommend Mafia 2 to anyone looking for a new sandbox gaming venture or someone who is generally fascinated with the 1940's-50's mafia and gang scene."

148292,5,"Well, I pre-ordered Infamous, followed the development of the game and downloaded the demo as soon as it was available.  Let me start by saying that I've been playing video games since the original Atari, later called the 2600.  I love games for gameplay and story, but nice graphics are obviously a nice to have.  After my first 4 hours of Infamous, I can say that I am pretty pleased with my purchase.  Infamous has a great narrative style that mixes graphic-novel art and the in-game engine.  It makes the game feel like an interactive comic book.  Also, after the huge disappointment for me that was Assassin's Creed, Infamous delivers a city that feels truly alive.  I have been playing as good and the missions have been fun, I expect repetition but running and climbing around Empire City is entertaining.  The reactions of people to you are also great, depending on your karma.

The sound is solid and having the PS3 hooked to your home entertainment system makes the Dolby audio shine.  So far I haven't heard a lot of music, only during certain missions and situations but it has suited the mood of the game.

In all, Infamous is a very fun game that every PS3 owner should pick up.  Nice work Sucker Punch!"

27402,5,"This game is the best game to grace the entire world. I can't emphasis enought on how great this game plays, looks and the life span is. To be honest with you I wasn't intereted in any of the previous gta games back on the playstation and the PC. I hated the constant birdseye view through the previous games which was one of the major reasons why I ignored them. But this game took me by surprise. One of the main resons why I fell for this game is because of the amazing graphics and the amount of good reviews this game was getting. Another good aspect is that you don't have to play any of the other Gta games to understand whats going of in the game. Its all at the start where you know whats going of. Another reason why I really think this game is all it is because it gives you the complete freedom to do anything you want to do. Whether beating up someone and getting their money in the process stealing someone's car getting a protitute and giving it her in the car with the car rocking up and down in the process. There are a few minor dense in the game like for e.g there is no in game music all the music comes from the vehicle that you are in. No motorbike like in the second one thats all about it."
94735,5,"I'm two years late to the PS3 party because I wasn't going to drop $600 on a game system.  WHen they hit $299 it was enough for me to make the plunge.  WIth this game in the <$20 range it's a great pick up and a no brainer.  Content wise it will keep you going for hours and a great use of all the main features of the controller + system.  Multiplayer is still alive and well and it was easy to find a group of people to run around and shoot at.

The story line was a surprise to me as I had not read any reviews and had only played it slightly in the store years ago.  Having it set in the 1950s was a surprise and a welcome treat because I'm a fan of alternative history speculative fiction.  The bad guys are pretty tough in the PVE mode and include teaming up on you and going for cover.  Very creative for FPS even with the newer titles out.

The opening chapter/massacre was pretty intense considering how blind I went into it.  THings softened up a bit afterwords but at first I was wondering if it was going to be this difficult even at the medium difficulty."
95208,5,Lovely game system to play on enjoying ever moment of it
34643,5,"This game is one of the greatest I've ever played, but buyer beware: this is an RPG, not a shooter or ""action"" game, although the game itself has plenty of action.

The game revolves around a character you create at the game's onset, whose past gets filled in as the story progresses and whose decisions influence the future of the galaxy. You eventually can pick up another nine characters, including Jedi, a Wookiee and droids, one of which is one of the most amusing characters I've ever seen. As the story takes place thousands of years before the events of the films, you don't need to be a Star Wars junkie to dive right in.

The game features lots of ways to customize your character's abilities, and more than enough sidequests to keep people interested. Many of these quests influence your alignment - the more you lean toward the Light Side, the more comfortable people will feel around you (and thus, I found, they will give you more quests as the game goes on). The Dark Side is pretty profitable, though, to make up for that.

The biggest thing that one has to get used to is the combat mechanic. It is very D&D-style, using a simulated 20-sided die roll to resolve actions (for example, a base target of 10 + 5 (for opponent's defense) - 3 (your attack bonus) = 12 (modified to-hit target). Thankfully, this mechanic runs in the background and is quickly ignored. When you sight an enemy, you can choose to engage them, choosing a series of actions to take (e.g. normal attack, special attack, throw grenade, normal attack) that you can modify on the fly. Hardcore shooter fans will hate it, but most people will adapt to it fairly quickly. Plus, the later stages of the game are frenetic enough that most people will appreciate KOTOR's approach to combat.

The game also has significant replay value - besides the obvious filling out your quest and item logs, your choices influence the ending. So if you played the first time as a goody-two-shoes, you can run through it again as a horseman of apocalypse and see what happens this time.

This game requires a serious investment of time - you're looking at least 25 hours, and that's only if you're amazingly good, uncannily lucky and do none of the sidequests.

A few minor complaints I have about the game: first off, the only time you can change a character's equipment is when they are in your active party. This is particularly frustrating when you are in your base with all nine standing around you, but becuase you haven't selected them, you physically have to leave the base with two at a time to change equipment (good luck if your pulling a 4-character switch like I did :( ). Second, some of the videos a dialogue animations are buggy. Third, there is a convenient ""Return to base"" option; the problem is, it is not always active. This is fine for, say, a boss stage you can't escape until you defeat said boss, but in some cases it makes no sense (i.e. I can walk back through one doorway and it will work on the other side).

Minor complaints aside, KOTOR rightly deserves those Game of the Year awards it won. If you like (or can at least tolerate) a true RPG, pick this up."
414089,5,So cool!
274417,5,"AWESOME mouse! The profiles change the color of the LED's on the mouse. Better DPI with laser and kicked my older Logitech laser mouse in the dust.  Software is easy to use and is need to assign buttons and DPI.  Also the cord can be placed in 3 different areas leading from the mouse's front.  Noticeable difference in playing shooting games, very spot on.  Need a new mouse? Don't pass this one up!  Also if you are into art on the computer, this mouse has GREAT accuracy!"
207817,5,"I played this game when it first came out in the arcades and it was so much fun.  I sucked at it, and still sort of suck at it, but being able to play a huge cast of characters from the Marvel and Capcom worlds was exhilarating.  That, mixed with some great animation, smooth and fast game-play, and cheesy quotes made for one of the best fighters I've ever played.

I downloaded this on PSN when I got my PS3, and I was slightly confused as this code has you download the demo and unlock code.  I guess you have to download the demo first, and then this code unlocks the game for you.  All the characters are there right from the beginning.
The only gripe I have is that there are some lag issues with the menu at times, but that may just be my PS3."

205014,5,"dont listen to Bekka he's just mad that i pulverized him in multiplayer today. :)
any ways this is by far the best gears to date the new carmine is awesome, their are a ton of mp characters, the campaign is exciting right off the bat, beast mode is well.....BEAST, and horde 2.0 is greatly improved. all in this game is great i would give this 100 stars if i could BUY IT.

P.S. you get 3 crimson owen stickers with the game........i put them on my XBOX 360 and they look beast"
411363,5,"Great game, first and foremost. It's a huge open world game, always something to do. The story is very long, I'm  maybe 1/3 way through and have already put 13 hrs on it. It's challenging, but not impossible. I love this game, it reminds me of Shadow of Mordor and Skyrim but so much better. Beautiful game."
293686,5,"Holy moly this thing is a friggen beast.  Honestly this is built to withstand a nuclear attack.

So the vita has always felt a little frail to me,  so I thought something labeled heavy duty was required.

I honestly did not expect to get something that could be used as a weapon in a post apocalyptic world if need be.  This case is so rugged it blows my mind...  You could probably throw this out of a car going 100mph and your vita would still be safe."
186327,5,"Great way to get the fam on the path of the past. Tripping balls on the beatles!!!

Great game, loads of fun, you'd have to be full retard to not puchase this for your xbox superband lineup."

317598,5,"For an MMORPG this game has it all: crafting, looting, raiding, exploring, massive multiplayer battles, great combat and can be played easily by yourself but the real magic happens when you're with a group. The PVP parts of the game feel decently balanced with enough challenge to keep you coming back but not so hard that it's frustrating. This is also a very long game that will give you literally hundreds of hours of gameplay. What's great about Elder Scrolls games is that they have a long shelf life: you can come back and pick up after months away and still feel in tune with it. It's different than ES 3-5, but actually if you played the original 1-2 you'll pick up tons of Easter eggs and lore. It is way more comprehensive than I expected and has tons of extra content as DLC. Admittedly when I first started I was slightly disappointed, who are these other people ruining my dungeon crawl?! But to be honest, once I stopped trying to compare it, it just grew so much on me. I've been playing for about a year off and on and absolutely think it is worth the time and money. This will definitely satiate your ES hunger until the next solo game comes out. Go in with an open mind and you will love it. It's not perfect, but it is a lot of fun, and for me that's what matters the most."
256697,5,Worked as described for me the first time around. Pricey for a single use cable. I gave it to my son for his use to make it more worthwhile (pricey cable should be included in the XBOX 360 Slim bundle)!
162492,5,"I know that there are many reviews on here from those that are most likely under 18 years old that are complaining about not being able to login to the game....all of these reviews are 1 star ratings.  If you want an actual honest opinion on the game from someone that understands all of the work that went into it and what it actually takes to keep servers running, etc...then read this one:

I played the Diablo 3 beta extensively, leveling each characters to max nearly every time they did a wipe.  I loved the beta even though it was just the first part of Act 1 and took all of 1.5 hours to finish.  I have logged into the game since it has been released and I can say that it is a pure masterpiece.  The quests are fun, the hack n' slash is the way it should be, but cut-scenes and cinematics take your breath away, and the game design is at its best.  Diablo 3 is 9+ years in the making and it shows.

I am a huge fan of RPG's and this has my stamp of approval.  For all those looking to have a blast in a game with great character progression and skill customization options, this is the game for you.  Unfortunately, I think many of the negative reviews are coming from people that did not play the previous Diablo games."

314568,5,"Wow, First off I don't think Nintendo can top this Mario Kart. I have to say this is the best Mario Kart thus far each level has some of the best colors graphics whatever you want to call it is fine, but Mario Kart 8 is one of Nintendo's treasure gems to be around for a long time.."
54945,5,"The Stalker stories out of Russia and the Ukraine are at the heart of this game. The disaster at Chernobyl left an indelible mark on both the inhabitants of the area and the soul of the people. This game is slowly paced but still incredibly atmospheric. While it can be unforgiving at times, and the gameplay can be brutal, it's still worth playing just for the sense of actually being there in a decaying Pripyat, highlighted by taking place in the actual locations in Ukraine.

If you like a challenging game, get this and some of the fan-created updates."
367782,5,Works with Wii U and computer (need drivers)
402839,5,I love this game I just don't have time to play it. Very fun. Graphics aren't as amazing as I would've thought but stil loads of fun. Glad I jumped on the fallout bandwagon even if I'm a year late
115959,5,"Fallout 3 is absolutely, undeniably, the best first-person RPG I've played to date.  I'll try and break down some reasons why in the following review.  For starters, I'm a game freak: tabletop miniatures, pen-and-paper RPGs, computer games, and console games... I try to give every type of game a chance, but some just don't cut it...

GRAPHICS, SOUND, ETC: There's really nothing to say about it... It's breathtaking, scary at times, and full of ""Wow"" moments.  The graphics on the 360 version are mouth-watering, eye-popping amazing.  The sound is engrossing.  I should mention that I run the game at 1080i via HDMI and hooked up to 5.1 surround.  I've tried it at 720p with just my TV stereo sound and I was no less impressed.

STORY/THEME: post world war 3; actually, 200 years post world war 3.  You can learn all about the history of this alternate timeline in the game; it is fascinating and creepy.  The story is compelling enough to want to play and play (more than you should), but it is not lead-you-by-the-nose.  Like all true Bethesda RPGs, Fallout lets you make the story.  You can choose which missions to do, or you can choose to just wander around like a freaked out, radiation-infected lunatic.

GAMEPLAY: Bethesda improved the game management and interface of Fallout.  I loved Morrowind and Oblivion (Bethesda's previous, fantasy-themed RPGs), but the interface was a bit clunky in those games.  Fallout fixes all the problems, in my opinion, and makes dealing with inventory and stats a breeze.  You'll spend more time sucked into the game world and story then managing your extensive list of weapons, items, etc...

VALUE: the game is pricey--as all newer games are--but I would pay $50 for this game because of two thing: (1) this game could be played many, many times through the original story alone; it is unlikely anyone will find every single hidden place, character, or side mission in one pass.  (2) Bethesda has already released relatively inexpensive add-ons that greatly improve the game; a couple of the expansions are almost entirely new games in and of themselves!

CONTENT: This game is not--NOT--for kids.  Take the Mature rating very seriously.  There is plenty of foul language, drug use, and sexually suggestive material.  The game is rated for and intended for adults.  Please do not let kids play this game.  I only turn this bad boy on when my kids are in bed for the night--period.

EDIT (UPDATED 11/5/10): I can't say enough about this game; 5 stars isn't high enough, let's put it that way.  I've finished all five DLC packs and would gladly pay for 5 more.  160+ hours later and I still love playing this game.  Whether I'm just exploring the wasteland or re-playing the main story with a new character, Fallout never seems to get old.  This is the first game ever that I kept--didn't trade in or give to a buddy.  I've been gaming for 20 years, so that should say something about how awesome this game is!  After trying Fallout: New Vegas, this game is still the best; there's no comparison.  Grab the Game of the Year edition and you'll be occupied for a LONG time."
470705,5,Its a great product and definitely seems solid!  Its my choice.

144818,5,"Now when you think of Nintendo,you think of family fun games that have no blood or lets just say an ""m"" rated title. Suda-51 had a great vision for this game and it is just flat out funny. You play as Travis Touchdown out to become the #1 assassin out there in Santa Destroy,California. I won't blurge the whole story. But the controls,the characters,and the story is just great. If you are tired of Mario and you want to play something more mature. You have got to check this game out. Rent it or buy it,I highly recomended you play it,and so does xplay."
364133,5,For my daughter. Seems to be the best version. We have powerful gaming PC's but I didn't want to mess with mods and the PS4 controller is much better for a kid than keyboard and mouse combo.
472764,5,Enjoying this game so far! I love that you can choose the classic version or spice things up. Very fun to play with family or friends!

322907,5,Best call of duty
168829,5,"Beautiful settings, filled with character. The story is a bit tough to follow because you pick it up in little pieces, but the game is fun, and even a bit scary at times. I'm not normally a fan of 1st person shooters, but this one hooked me."
362532,5,they work great and help when playing late into the night.
21812,5,"Hahaha - just kidding! My parents didn't care what I did! They were too busy making money to support a family that burned thru more cash than Bush did looking for weapons of mass destruction. ZING.

A very fun but VERY CHALLENGING game. Seriously - you better have a game genie close by cuz dis game is one tough customer."
167305,5,"I've played Borderlands on the PS3 and the Xbox 360 and the edge goes to the 360 because of the controller.

While playing Uncharted I didn't think the controller felt bad. The reason was they assigned ""fire"" to the R1 button. When I hold the PS3 controller my fingers naturally rest on that button. With Borderlands they want you to use L2 and R2 constantly. It's not a very comfortable position and the matter was made worst by the triggers. Your fingers had no resistance.

So these are essential, in my opinion, for any game which requires the use of the L2 and R2 buttons. I really hope Sony redesigns their controller next gen. But seeing as I have a choice, I'll just stick to the 360 for multi-platform games."
246041,5,"In my opinion is the best halo .it have got excellent graphics and the multiplayer is very addictive ,ten points for all"
293769,5,STURDY

22929,5,"If you have any hesitation as to how good or bad this game is, I will simply say that this game is the best Indiana Jones game ever. All of the classics are here: the whip, adventure hat, and all the creepy-looking baddies you could want. After you play it, you will be wishing the new movie would come out right now."
458513,5,It was a great price on this game. I love playing this game & think it should be added to the PSN network.
398354,5,"I purchased dragon age and it was mildly entertaining, I just found it hard to get into. I first saw footage from the witcher 3 a long time ago so I was anticipating its release. Here's my pros and cons.

Pros:

The open world is massive. There are several areas to explore and each has unique qualities. I would definitely say the world is larger than skyrim if its true that you can go anywhere you can visibly see. Plus, there's no load screens when walking in or out of buildings and towns.

The story is deep with many side quests along with it to ensure every gamer hundreds of hours of gameplay. There is also a very good XP system to distribute unlock points as you wish.

The combat mechanics are fun and challenging. It is similar to bloodbourne in the dodging/countering manner. I like how the powers you choose to level up can play a key role in the overall success of taking down certain monsters.

The graphical and art design of the witcher 3 is superb. Wind blows trees realistically and sunsets are beautiful. Character models shine with fantastical realism.

Cons:

The menu UI is a pain sometimes. It can take a while to buy/sell items at a vendor just to find your way through the menus.

I don't recommend fighting any enemies that are more than two levels above your own. I get my butt handed to me most of the time when trying."

228209,5,Works Great!
414197,5,it was great
340558,5,"Completed the game, very pleased. Don't worry about the people saying it's too short, they're clearly doing the fastest straight through run they can -which is absolutely silly. If you're playing the game with the intention of clearing each zone 100%, getting all the side missions, etc. this will easily run you 30-40 hours. If you're skipping all that to finish as fast as you can, then you're an idiot to complain that it ended too quickly.

Great game, I liked the character development, and aside from one of the later conduits, the supporting cast was well written as well. I hope Sucker Punch has a direct follow-up already  in the works."
214904,5,"like fps games, content, length of game was excellent.  Price was right was fun to play, if you like fps games give this one a try!"

140993,5,"I personally love the Wii Fit game and Balance Board.  This game is fun and
keeps you interested. The game has levels that get unlocked and lots of
exercises to keep you occupied. I never ever get bored of this game. I lost
a couple pounds so far from using this game."
48383,5,"This game, by no means, is for newbies. IF you think your a real rpg gamer then this is teh game for you. It will take work for you too build up your forces and your ship, but after that things are smooth sailing. SUre teh combat isn't the best but it's the rpg physics and exploration that count, you will never run out of open water or islands..... never. The game also has a deep stat and skill system which both lend themselves to brilliance.
The graphics are the best point of the game, too much greatness to be had. Better than it's counterpart morrowind in that department this game gives you a wet dream every time you look upon it.
Simply put, this game needs to be bought, it's great roleplaying and great fun. Don't let reviews fool you, this game is exceptionally good."
386331,5,very good
71760,5,This game played well on my i7 laptop and was just as enjoyable as playing on the console!
256023,5,this game is so much fun I love it very funny fast action game great graphics & gameplay would recommend definitely.
74678,5,"WHAT!!!I only bought it because it was cheap. Greeeeeeat time. I have it for more than a month already,don't even remember charging it more than twice. You should get it,"
398606,5,"The hate for this game makes me question if people play games to have fun or stare at every pixel they can until they find something out of place to complain about. I've moved past the the bandwagon of blind hate and purchased the game. I might have about one gripe with the game and that's the turning is much slower than it used to be, I can get over that though. The graphics are completely fine and do not ruin anything about the game. You people expected photo realistic from a TH game? Stupid skate fanboys. I Skate as well but TH is NEVER going to be like Skate, so stop complaining. The physics are fine and the tricks are completely fine. I'm thinking that the people who rated their score low have never played a Tony Hawk game. If you loved the Ps2 Tony Hawk games then I'm more than sure you'll love this one. Tons of fun and if you have friends, then It will be that much better. I would say, don't trust any of the user reviews on here and try it for yourself. You might end up liking it. Also, I haven't came across any glitches and have been playing for several weeks."
237459,5,love this game
437097,5,"In love with this. Everything is visually improved, the sprites are more detailed and I really like the new spin on the music! A perfect purchase."
291940,5,Great console for any games really!
84369,5,If you don't know what smash is then you just need to click the buy now button. Greatest game ever (and probably the only reason I bought the wii). I don't know how many hours I've burned on this game through multi player battles with friends. This is a religion in our college house.
326236,5,I love these games and with good reason. An extremely in depth game play makes this a great buy for anyone.
269366,5,"Worked great! Arrived fast! And it isn't top notch so you can't compare it to an HDMI. But since my port is broken, until I get it fixed, this is the next best thing! And there is a MAJOR difference between the TV and HD settings!"
356706,5,"I am new to the Farcry franchise, but I have always heard good things.  I have traditionally been a COD player, with the emphasis on online multiplayer.  I was so disappointed in COD AW that I wanted to give Farcry a try, and I couldn't be more impressed.  This game is absolutely stunning.  I don't even know where to begin.  The story is great, the landscape is gorgeous, and the game play is dynamic and constantly exciting.

I know there were some reviews from long time Farcry fans that complained that this version is not much different than Farcry 3, but take it from me, COD AW was so divergent from previous installments that it just completely let me down.  Familiarity is a good thing in gaming, and slowly evolving your franchise is a smart way to keep fans.

What I love about this game is the diversity of game play style and different types of activity that you can get involved in.  There's a GTA feel to it with the driving and open world missions.  This game does what some of the bigger names could not.  Destiny was very ambitious, but fell way short.  This game far surpasses all of the big names released this year (Titan Fall, COD, Destiny).

Some of the standouts of the game are:
Map hugeness
Raiding Outposts is so much fun
Hunting is always a treat
Karma system really makes me feel like I have a stake in the outcomes of my allies
Driving / Flying is a blast
Weapons are fierce (I can't tell you how much fun I have blowing up enemy trucks with my grenade launcher)
Crafting system is solid
Syringes are useful
Skills ladder is very well done and thoughtful

I have not yet tried the multiplayer.

For anyone that is looking for a fun game for the holidays and has about 40-50 hours to kill, give this a try."
87568,5,Really good old game people still play it online I haven't played it for a month but it should still have a good amount of online community. I bought it mostly to play terrorist hunt online and I am satisfied with it.
406201,5,"Tthe game is overall stunning,loving it!"
202867,5,Very Nice
305462,5,one of best game ever made !!
331774,5,Got what I wanted and it was as described.
275715,5,"I so wish that I had known that a player MUST BE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OLD TO Play this game other than under just Campaign level. This is the first time I have purchased a game that requires an age minimum for playing. If your Xbox Live account age is not at least 13 you can not obtain access to play this game. We have tried calling Xbox, EA Sports, talking to supervisors and doing numerous Google searches. If anyone knows how to get around this please reply to my post. Our 13 year old can play, and he chose to buy it for our soon to be 12 year old so they could play together and the system settings will only allow ""Campaign"" play for the 12 year old."
489101,5,great game
262008,5,"Bought this pack for $5 - which is just about the right price. Nothing to amazing here, so don't spend a lot of money on it."
62566,5,"I'm obsessed with the sims as it is, so this was a nice addition to have!"
89244,5,"I don't understand why some people spent 60 bucks on games like fifa 12 or nba 2k12 when they could have gotten this for 4 bucks? I mean seriously the graphics are almost as good, the gameplay is basically the same, only the teams are different but so what? Great game, very cheap, BUY IT"
5114,5,"Love it or hate it, this is side scrolling action at its best.  I see that a lot of people complained that it borrowed from Metroid; I say kudos!  Metroid was also great and was in my opinion the best side scroller until SOTN.  You can read any number of reviews for the particulars, but I want to point out that this game is available for $9.99 to download from the PS3 store onto your PS3 or PSP.

Oh yeah!"
305261,5,My son loves this game
85695,5,"Each generation has its own videos, music, art, books and whatnot, to define it.

With modern society, games have started to become more of a culture and attraction than anything in the past. Anymore, a good game can easily compete, if not outsell, novels and cinematic bigscreen movies.

They are no longer animated-pixel ""toys"" to the modern world, and can tell a tale and show a world just as vast and creative as those in a movie or book.

And for a game like Grand Theft Auto 4, it not only disproves games are just for nerdy gamers, but its not much of a game at all, as it is a work of art. Quite simply, its the most stunning rendition of reality and the modern world in the face of crimes, gangs, and dilluted dreams of the ""land of the free"". As soon our character is alive, and the world around you breathes and moves like a typical stroll down a major city or coastline.

I could go on and on into detail, missions, control, story, but whats the point? It's so perfected, that nothing needs to be said other than ""How did thy do it?"". It's literally breathtaking and awe-inspiring.

I've played 5 hours of it since yesterday, but I can can stand here and produly proclaim that this game is going to be the game that defines this era.

I used to beleive it was the original 1993 id software release DOOM that defined everything for the gaming community, and open up gateways for infinite possibilities for generations to come, but where as it changed the way we perceived and would play games, and what could be permitted in them, Grand Theft Auto 4 redefines by adding life to a game, the ability to step into your character and everything becomes suddenly aware as if you were there yourself.

Do yourself a favor, buy this game. And if you don't have a console to play it on, buy one, and experience it for yourself."

I wish you could turn the LED at night, it can be a little bright. Other than that great mouse, great quality."
